This edition is billed as \"The Complete Bible.\" It doesn't have one person reading the gospels. It features nearly 400 African-American artists, actors and ministers, plus sound effects. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just listen to Blair Underwood's rendition of Jesus on the cross. Mr. BLAIR UNDERWOOD (Actor) : (As Jesus) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, we've got two people affiliated with the project with us today. Kyle Bowser, he co-produced \"The Bible Experience\" and actress Wendy Raquel Robinson, one of the actors in \"The Bible Experience,\" and she also stars in the CW series, \"The Game.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi folks, how are you doing? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Great. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Great. How are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Now, Kyle, how did this project come about? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Hmm. A couple of winters ago, while Christmas shopping, I purchased an audio bible and hoped that I would finally get through the Bible by listening to it in my car. And I had failed to read the Bible as I'd promised. And after listening to a couple of disks, I was very disappointed. It just didn't really resonate with me. There was a lack of real production value. And the idea struck that perhaps we should try to do this ourselves and bring the Hollywood experience that we have to the process. And I think we have accomplished that goal. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Were you ever afraid of crossing a line and saying, okay, we're going to make this too Hollywood - the Bible is going too Hollywood? And I'm thinking of all the criticism of Mel Gibson's movie, \"The Passion of the Christ.\" \n\n ###",
