FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, we've got two people affiliated with the project with us today. Kyle Bowser, he co-produced \"The Bible Experience\" and actress Wendy Raquel Robinson, one of the actors in \"The Bible Experience,\" and she also stars in the CW series, \"The Game.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi folks, how are you doing? \n\n ###",

Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Hmm. A couple of winters ago, while Christmas shopping, I purchased an audio bible and hoped that I would finally get through the Bible by listening to it in my car. And I had failed to read the Bible as I'd promised. And after listening to a couple of disks, I was very disappointed. It just didn't really resonate with me. There was a lack of real production value. And the idea struck that perhaps we should try to do this ourselves and bring the Hollywood experience that we have to the process. And I think we have accomplished that goal. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Were you ever afraid of crossing a line and saying, okay, we're going to make this too Hollywood - the Bible is going too Hollywood? And I'm thinking of all the criticism of Mel Gibson's movie, \"The Passion of the Christ.\" \n\n ###",

Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : I have a cousin who, three months ago, was struck by a car while riding his bike. And he's been laying paralyzed for the last three months. And on his second day in the hospital, he whispered in his wife's ear, asking for her to bring a copy of \"The Bible Experience\" to his room.

You know what I mean? You have to really drink it, so when they did the interpretations in the studio and if you even get a chance to see the video portion of it, it's amazing.

So I'm going to start with you, Lauren. You're voting for Donald Trump. Did you support him in the Republican primary? LAUREN SMITH : No, I actually supported Ted Cruz. And, you know, I have to say, there's no question that this election cycle has been unbelievable. So I'm voting for Trump because not only am I a Republican but he has a pro-life agenda. He's for a limited government, and that's what I support. Am I happy with him? No, absolutely not. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Nick, you've decided to support the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. How come? Why not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Why go with a third-party option? NICK TOMCHIK : All my life, I've gone against the status quo. I'm a Libertarian myself. I definitely believe in what Gary Johnson has to offer, his policies - minimizing the role of government, pro-choice. You know, we've got to cut the wasteful spending. We've got to offer an alternative. And especially with this election being so, you know, as Lauren said, you know, pretty much crazy, we've got to have another choice. And he brings that to America. And I really like that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Genesis, you said you're leaning reluctantly towards Hillary Clinton.

But I just can't support what Donald Trump has said, even though I did vote Republican for the primaries. However, I did vote for Marco Rubio. I feel like this election, at least for me, has come down to voting against someone instead of a vote for someone that actually aligns with a lot of, like, my views for certain issues. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And you haven't found that in either of the major party candidates? GENESIS LARIN : It was mentioned before that Hillary Clinton, her experience as far as policies - and I do take into account her experience. And I guess I feel comfortable because she has been around. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What do you not like about her? What gives you pause about her? GENESIS LARIN : Part of it is her scandals.

I mean, you're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, but she's had kind of a tough time making inroads with people your age. What are the top issues for you? ASHANTI MARTINEZ : One of them would be definitely college affordability, making sure that no matter where you are on the income spectrum in this country that you can go to college debt-free or that you can leave college debt-free. The next issue for me is health care, making sure that folks are able to have quality health care in this country. And then I guess the next issue for me that really comes home is criminal justice reform. Too many people of black and brown skin color, that look like me, go to jail, oftentimes, for sentences and things that they shouldn't have. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I want to ask you, Lauren - you heard Genesis say that she identifies as a Republican. She voted for Marco Rubio in the primary, but she's considering voting for Hillary Clinton. What do you say to her? LAUREN SMITH : I think as a Republican, I don't understand how you could support Hillary Clinton. And I understand many of what Trump has said is, quite frankly, deplorable. And I completely get that. However, if you're a Republican, if you believe in limited government, if you're pro-life, vote for Donald Trump. And again, that's the issues that I fully support and that I want to see happen in America. I want Roe v. Wade to be overturned.

NICK TOMCHIK : Not at all. I definitely think that that plays into the fear-mongering because from a lot of people I hear, they want to vote for Gary but they're - you know, they tell me that argument. And essentially, if all the people who, you know, actually voted third party - said that they're not going to vote for the third party because of that voted third party, then, you know, Gary Johnson has a huge chance of winning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Lauren, your candidate, Donald Trump, has had a hard time getting the kind of support from women voters that he needs to put him in good standing when November 8 rolls around. Why do you think that is, especially when you talk to your peers, other young women?

But we have to remember that was a long time ago. I mean, 2005 happened almost 11 years ago. So as far as Donald Trump's comment on women go - does it bother me? It does in some ways, but I'm choosing to look at the bigger picture. And I'm choosing to look at America as a whole instead of trying to, you know, just go and tear Trump to shreds over what he said in the past.

And it's something that is definitely on people's minds, especially around my age group. But this isn't the first instance, right? We look at the comments that he had with former Miss America and former Miss Universe contestants. We look at the comments that he had about contributors on different networks. We look at the comments that he's had of people on his own show, on \"The Apprentice,\" and how he's treated women throughout his career, whether it be in real estate or whether it be on television. So to me, to say that these things don't matter is wrong. This man has so many different things that don't speak to our country as being inclusive and as progressive as we should be.

Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : I bought a house in the neighborhood I grew up in, near my widowed mother who still resides in my childhood home. I was lucky to buy it at a good price years ago. You see, we live in an inner city, speedily gentrifying community with increasing mignons of hip, progressive, urban pioneering neighbors. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : I just love the new politically correct terms for yuppies who decide that these little black neighborhoods have the cutest little cottages. All they need is for people to move into them that can give them the love, attention and exponentially increasing property values their presence alone can bring. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : These watchful neighbors then patrol the old hood with their cell phones handy. If they see something that just isn't right, they call up the codes department, anonymously of course, and cry foul. So a couple of weeks ago, my mom's hot water heater gave up the ghost and flooded the basement as a memorial. Yours truly drew the task of pulling 40 years of accumulated memories out of the basement to get to the flooding and save the day. \n\n ###",

One of the ever-vigilant friendly neighborhood preservationist saw the pile by the basement door and reported my mother's home as the site of a public dump. Welcome to America. Luckily, I'd already ordered a dumpster unbeknownst to the good neighbors, so I sped up its delivery, charged the iPod, put on my favorite work jeans and started attacking memory mountain one little bit at a time. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : Mom was going to help, but I told her I had it covered. I was jamming to the soundtrack of (unintelligible). Happy thoughts was sailing as I stepped into the mini mountain with my right foot. That's when it happened. I hadn't looked where I was stepping. If I had, I would have remembered I was directly over a hole in the ground my dad put a piece of wood over. And that was a good temporary fix, but I should mention that my dad passed away six years ago. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : Well, mix the way the five feet of junk, seven or eight years of rot, a fresh rain and a primary weight of a 6'2, 190-pound brother man on a size 13 boot, and what do you have - every bit of that mix headed two directions at blinding speed, forward and down. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : Instinct may be reached to both sides. And with a mix of luck and skill, I was able to catch myself just as I felt cold water rising up almost to my knee. There was no bottom. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor, Playwright) : I said, whoa, out loud, then I had another thought. Wait a minute, is this a well or a sewer? Oh, crap - an unintentional pun. I pulled myself up as one of the tenants was singing some Italian aria in my ears. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : In the nation's capital, a killer is on the loose. It's been operating in America for decades now. We're talking about AIDS. Tomorrow is World AIDS Day. Today, we'll discuss staggering new information on how prevalent AIDS is in Washington D.C., particularly among African-Americans. Overall, the rate of AIDS cases in Washington D.C. is about 10 times higher than in the United States. Dr. Shannon Hader is the director of the D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration. Welcome. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, these are really some chocking numbers. Sixty percent of the city's residents are African-American, but 81 percent of new HIV cases in the city are among African-Americans. How many people are we really talking about? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, you know, we have about 12,500 people in the district right now living with HIV and AIDS, but about 80 percent of those are mainly African-American communities. So, we're talking a high number of people, not just a hundred or two hundred, but thousands. \n\n ###",

Are you seeing these number of new infections increase? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, you know, certainly over the United States, the trend over the last decade has been increasing racial disparities and the HIV epidemic with more African-Americans affected. Here in the district, we have really good data for the last 2001 through 2006, and what we see is that we're not gaining much ground at this point in terms of reducing infections, although we seem to be holding a little bit even. And - but I think particularly among the women, the rates among women have been increasing over the last five or six years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What percentage of women in the D.C. area are African-American who were infected? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Mm-hmm. Among all the women that we know are infected with HIV in the district, about 90 percent of them are African-American. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : With these numbers, with the racial disparities, what is being done? What are the approaches that you and other government, public health officials, nonprofits are taking to really start addressing this? \n\n ###",

HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, I think what we're doing and what we need to continue to do is an attack on all fronts. First step is, information is power. These data, these hard facts give us a good picture for everyone at the individual level, at the community level, at the government level, at the policy level, to really wake up if they haven't and see the nature of the epidemic we're dealing with. Second, it's about services and it's about taking action, both to protect yourself and protect others. We are ramping what was already sort of a groundbreaking HIV policy in the district, which is this know your status, HIV tests should be just the same as knowing about your other routine health indicators. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : So, our goal is, by 2009, when you go to an emergency department, they should routinely offer you an HIV test. When you show up at your primary care doctor's office, you should get, just like you get the rest of the tests for your annual physical - you get your BMI for obesity, you get a blood pressure for hypertension, you get your blood sugar for diabetes - you should be getting your HIV status as well, without having to sort of beg for it or ask specifically. This has to be part and parcel about how we all approach our general health going forward. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There have been celebrity campaigns that say things like, it's good know, know your status, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but people are afraid. All of us have fears and some people may not want to know. What's the sense that you get of that? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, I think that that issue of stigma, fear, and silence is huge. And absolutely, that impacts people searching their test results, but it also impacts people taking preventive measures and taking care of measures to keep their health strong. I've been incredibly motivated by Mayor Fenty's leadership in saying, I'm making HIV/AIDS our number one health priority here in the district. And, in large part, a lot of that has to do with saying, come on, let's come together, let's break the stigma, break the fear, break the silence. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Who's really responsible for this - responsible may be the wrong word, but, I mean, Washington D.C. is a very interesting case of the overlap of the federal government and the local government. So, what responsibilities does it seem as if each has in dealing with this issue? \n\n ###",

Certainly, one of the specific relationship issues that's come out in D.C. has been this issue of Congress limiting our ability to spend our own district tax money on our own district programs and specifically, I'm talking about needle exchange programs. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Certainly, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has been working as well as Mayor Fenty has been working to convince Congress to remove that restriction on our funds, and I'm confident that that's going to happen this year. So, that's something that's specific to the district that other jurisdictions don't have to deal with. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How much of needle exchange programs become more popular?

So, we just heard from Carla. She waited to tell her kids and family about her illness. So let's start off with disclosure. When is the right time to really reveal the illness to others if you have HIV or AIDS? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Well, disclosure is based on a needed-to-know, and that need to know starts with, of course, the individual's sexual partner. However, when it comes to disclosing some of your status to your children, there's no black and white answer or yes or no in terms of when to or when not to disclose. It depends on several factors, which include - some of these factors include the age of the child, child's emotional maturity, the child's intellectual and the child's intellectual functioning. And - but before disclosure takes place, my recommendation is that the infected person, of course, meets with a mental health professional who has experience in this particular field. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So when you, as a psychologist, deal with individuals who have a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS, what are some of the most common questions that come up in your sessions? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Disclosure is typically the first issue. Do I need to tell my children? Is, (unintelligible) the children or younger than 15 or 14, parents are probably concerned about their longevity in terms of whether they'll be, whether or not they will be available or be around to see their children grow up, finish high school, become functional adults themselves. So they really want to know when and how do I let my children know, or if I let - should I let my children know.

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah. I was just going to ask you about that because we heard earlier in the show how rampant AIDS has become among African-Americans in the Washington, D.C. area particularly, but obviously, there are plenty of places where there's just a huge increase. And when you think about this idea of telling someone, there have been all these campaigns to ask people to open up. But do you think that's really working? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Well, again, the issue of social stigma, shame, guilt, lack of education and knowledge are some of the factors that prevent individuals from disclosing their status. One of the things that must be readdressed was the need for information and education and that's our first line of defense. Once we educate ourselves, then we're able to protect ourselves. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Carla Bailey has been living with AIDS for 13 years. There are people who've been living with AIDS for over two decades.

And he talked about, for example, eliminating the National Income Tax and coming up with a fair tax and, so I thought he did a good job in using his sense of humor, being quick on the question of what would Jesus do on the death penalty. But I thought that was somewhat of an evasion to the extent that he never answered the question about what Jesus would do on the death penalty.

Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : Yeah. I mean, I would characterize the debate as gods, guns, gays and illegals with illegals leading the way and what really touched off was the idea that they really see immigration as an issue of sort of the criminality with - there being a really stark difference between the people who've been governors and mayors who've had to take a sort of practical view about the issue, understanding that the people are there. They need to have certain kinds of policies to sort of deal with their existence being in sharp contrast to those who haven't had to deal with that. \n\n ###",

I found that one of the best was moving people off welfare. I moved 640,000 people off welfare, most of them to jobs.

Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : You know, that began with a southern strategy and a range of other things. Giuliani was roundly hated by African-American voters - most of the people he'd moved off welfare, he moved in to poverty. And, you know, the issues were sort of - and another thing that they continued to address is, is that, African-Americans are addressed through the lens of crime. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : And there are a lot of issues that face the community that are not related to crime, as James mentioned. The economy issues around trade; health care was not talked about at all. Those are things that are really core African-American issues and if, you know, for instance, if Romney thinks that education is a civil rights issue of our time, what is he going to do about it? There was no substance to the response. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : When you take a step back and look at how these guys are positioning themselves for the general election, there actually was a chance for them to do their own YouTube commercial and John McCain and Tom Tancredo showed themselves squaring off with Hillary Clinton. So they went for that aspect of it. Fred Thompson went for the jugular with the other candidates. Do you think that, at this point - first of all, there's a presumption that Hillary Clinton will be the person to beat. And secondly, that there should be a term from just attacking each other to moving into talking about the general election. James, how do you feel about that? Were they more focused on each other or more focused on the general election? \n\n ###",

But I think at this point, it seems almost staged that Giuliani and Romney started this whole debate last night as a kind of, you know, Mike Tyson's fight. You know, the first few minutes were furious and - on the issue of immigration, but, you know, eventually, they sort of, you know, moved away from each other and began to try to talk about Hillary Clinton, but she never really fully, I think, became the focus of the debate last night. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Mark, it sounds like he is saying that basically, it was just mano a mano among the Republicans. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : Yeah. Well, I mean, you can see that. I mean, it's a very tight race on their side. There's no - there's not really a sort of - I guess, Giuliani is the presumptive frontrunner. But it's not clear that he's going to win in Iowa, and someone could pick up a lot of momentum, so therefore, it was really set up. I mean, eventually, it was going to emerge as, at least, a little bit of the argument of who's best positioned to run against Hillary. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : And - but it's - and, again, that may also be a mistake because it's not quite clear that Hillary may be the final opponent. If you look at what's going on in Iowa, if Obama picks up a win there and gains some momentum, things could shift and that sort of Republican argument that we're gearing up for Hillary may not become - come into fruition, actually. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There's going to be a forum this weekend that deals with black and brown issues in the heartland. And, of course, the first two states - the first state, the Iowa caucus, is not very black or brown, but is that going to, James, be able to insert some issues into the consciousness even as we go towards the first couple of states that don't have a lot of people of color? \n\n ###",

Mr. TOM DEARDORFF (Deardorff Family Farms, Oxnard California) : Well, they actually have a very good track record in California and from a food-safety standpoint, we are the leading producers of the safest, best supply of tomatoes. So, it's a matter of educating the consuming public about where their tomatoes are coming from and about the measures that have been implemented in the last 10 to 15 years to help increase the food-safety elements of our products. ALEX COHEN, host : Even though tomatoes here in California are considered safe, I'm wondering if you've taken any additional safety precautions with your crops. Mr. TOM DEARDORFF (Deardorff Family Farms, Oxnard California) : Yeah. Food safety is obviously an evolving thing, and we continue to implement new measures every year.

It feels just a little bit weird. So how do you go about convincing people when you can't be there for every, you know, individual potential buyer? Mr. TOM DEARDORFF (Deardorff Family Farms, Oxnard California) : And consumer confidence is a very finicky thing and we've seen with prior problems with food-safety issues, it's usually an initial huge reaction, and then it takes six to nine to sometimes 12 months to regain that consumer confidence. We are hoping that this time, because the domestic food supply has been cleared and has been recognized as not being a part of any of these warnings, that hopefully that recovery time is much quicker. We're going to need a lot of help from the government to help us get that message out. We are going to need a lot of help from our industry marketing associations.

So the numbers, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped a little bit. They were 6.24 percent last month. Now, to a six-month low of 6.20 percent. That doesn't sound like very much, so why is it making economists happy? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : Oh, it's making economists happy because it does reflect a little bit of what they've said that we need to see to try to bring some of the housing market back. I mean, one of the things that - one of the major factors that conspired to due to the housing market what it's been doing, is the fact that the rates have gone up. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : If you remember, much of what happened in the housing market over the last several years was due to the fact that we have rates that would have historical lows. And people began to buy homes and take out interest only or adjustable rate mortgages that were based on these very low rates. When those rates reset at higher levels, people - that's when you started to see people defaulting on their homes, and you started to see from the credit crunch some people in the mortgage market drying up. People weren't able to go out and borrow as much as they had been or they weren't able to borrow at all. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : So when you start to see some loosening in that in terms of the rates readjusting downward, then economists are going to be a little bit happy about that.

I mean - the problem with someone who's in a mortgage right now who wants to refi out of it is that in many instances, they are trying to refi out of a mortgage on a house that's basically worth more than they can - than the house can be sold for - excuse me, worth less that house can be sold for. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : For example, say you bought a house three years ago, and your interest - your adjustable rate mortgage had an initial rate that was set at, say, 4 percent for three years. Well, today, that mortgage would obviously - the rate would be much higher than that initial 4 percent. But then the other piece of it is, if the house was worth $150,000 three years ago, today it may only be worth, say, $120,000, or $110,000. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : So when you got to refinance that house, you really have no equity in it at all, and that's the problem that people are facing when they want to refi out of these mortgages. So it's not something that's really helping people that already own their homes or are already in a mortgage and want to get out of one, just because it was a bad mortgage and they can no longer afford it. What it may do is help loosen up credit for some people who want to buy - who hadn't been able to in the last four to six months. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So it should help you if you're a new homeowner or seeking to be a new homeowner? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : It could help you. I mean, provided you qualify, provided you meet all the qualifications to get a mortgage. And it's much more difficult to do that now than it was, say, a year ago. But if you do qualify, it makes a little bit easier for you, at least in terms of what you would pay on a monthly basis because the rates are lower than it had been in several months.

You saw sales, particularly online sales go up this year compared with last year, according to the initial data that came in. Still we're up 8.3 percent on Black Friday compared with last year, but that is with fewer customers coming into the stores. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : The only thing that you have to worry about is not just what happens on Black Friday because people have this idea that Black Friday is the day that it all happens. Black Friday is really the day that it kicks off. So the holiday shopping season traditionally starts on Black Friday, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that's when retailers make all their money. That is the day that it kicks off the holiday shopping season, and it needs sales to continue to be strong, at least for the next several weeks leading into Christmas shopping season. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : What happened this year, as you saw, pretty strong sales, stronger than expected sales on Black Friday because you had so many door-buster sales. Retailers were so worried about how dismal they thought it was going to be that they put everything on sale, and a lot of people came out, and they bought a lot of stuff, and they got better deals than they expected to get. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : But Saturday, it trailed off. And, you know, so they're worried about whether or not it's going to continue to be strong, given they started so early, right after Halloween, and they had so many sales on Black Friday, whether or not they can maintain the pace that they need to see a truly good holiday shopping season at this point.

They're looking for the low price point; they're looking for items that aren't necessarily as expensive. This is different from another phenomenon that involved shoppers, sort of mixing and matching what they do. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : For example, you may go to Target and buy house wares at a relatively inexpensive price, but then you and buy coats and bags that cost $300 or $400 at a Macy's or some other department store. Well, this year, the $400 handbag seems to be - is out, and people are looking for that mid-price point. A video game as opposed to a video game system; a DVD player as opposed to the big screen TV that everybody was buying last year. So with shoppers buying the less expensive items and everything being at a discounted rate, you can see some of the position that the retailers are finding themselves in. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Are retailers and shoppers essentially in opposition to each other, if not at war with each other? What I mean by that is, so many people are carrying big credit-card debt, and so you might think, okay, don't spend too much money. But then, retail helps drive the American economy. What are the different things that are - or what are the forces that are at play here? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : I don't think the retailers are at war with the consumer. It's not as if consumers are out there, you know, protesting or demanding that retailers lower their prices, you've just got some external forces out there. People in the United States, American consumers are just that, they are consumers. They want to buy things that makes us feel good. It's a reflection to a certain extent of your wealth or at least how wealthy you feel. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : But right now, people just don't feel as wealthy as they have over the last several years. You've got a situation where, you know, oil is very expensive, newer record, around $97 a barrel, which is just about a dollar or so off from a record for crude oil. That affects, obviously, what you pay to heat your home, and we are entering winter, although it doesn't feel like that in many parts of the country yet. \n\n ###",

The housing economy, obviously, as we just discussed, is often has been for the better part of the year, people's houses are worth less, people can't go in and refinance their houses or can't borrow because the value of the house or due to Christmas that they have been over the last several years.

It's not that people don't want to buy or that they're ignoring what the retailers are doing. It's just that people are in a position that they haven't been in for the last several years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, let's take a quick look at something else affecting retail. It's a question of affinity buying. Do you, basically, vote your social conscience with your dollar? So there's a specific case every year since'96, the NAACP has put out a report on corporate retailers in black communities. Target, for the past three years, has not participated in the survey. The NAACP is bringing this up pointedly. Now, there's so much focus on stores that market themselves as good for the environment or green. Do people even look at what's good for diversity when they buy? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : I think some people do. Although I don't really know that there's any evidence that that it's enough to move the needle, and I have to admit that I haven't seen data on this. But I do think that, you know, there's always going to be some segment of the population that will be influenced in their buying decisions by - based on certain social or political concerns and that will cut across the gamut you will always have, X percentage of the population whose going to be very concerned with the environment? X percent of the population who is going to be very concerned with animal rights. X percent of the population is going to be - excuse me - very concerned with racial or community factors. And that percentage in the population, I think is relatively small. What the challenge is for the NAACP in the report that you talked about in their effort to galvanize something that will boycott will be to agitate beyond that base of consumers that's already buying with those concerns in mind and\u2026 \n\n ###",

There's a blog called \"Black is Back,\" and the blogger who runs that made a point of saying online that when he was running a teen, parent and adult education program, Target with the only business that donated things consistently. If Target does have that kind of a track record - at least according to one person - very briefly, why would they avoid participating in this kind of a survey? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : It's hard to tell. That could be an indicator of any number of things. Target may have some issue with the criteria that the NAACP uses to come to its report card in which case it would - it might refuse to participate in the survey. Target - it's not necessarily something that smacks as something sinister or it doesn't necessarily indicate that they're not doing some of the things like giving back to communities based on race or based on any other concern.

Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well, what I discovered is that the plants made a different shape. They changed how much they put into roots when they were grown with strangers sharing the same pot, but not when they were growing with their siblings. So, their whole, how they grow - their morphology -  depends on who they are growing with and basically it shows that they can recognize their kin.

MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, plants don't have a brain. They don't have eyes. They don't have a sense of smell, I don't think? So how are they able to do this? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well plants have a lot of ways of sensing the environment. They sense all sorts of things about the environment. And they while they don't have eyes, for example, they have photo receptors which let them sense things about the color of the light. And that is actually a really well-known way the plants can sense whether or not there are other plants around them. We think that this is probably a chemical cue. Some research  I'm doing in collaboration with someone at the University of Delaware, Harsh Bais, shows that there's something - they put something in the liquid surrounding the roots that illicits this stranger response. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And what good does it do the plant? Does it make it better able to live? To succeed? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well, what we think is that - you know, our hypothesis, working hypothesis, is that competition is costly for plants and that if that they can agree not to compete, they will all do better.

You know, we had one study where we are writing up, that shows when resources are scarce, they'll compete as strongly with relatives as they will with anyone else.

ALEX COHEN, host : So, does gender really make a difference when it comes to technology? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : Of course it does. Gender, as we know, impacts all kinds of things. To understand how men and women use technology differently, I think you have to kind of back it up a little bit and think about how men and women have different, in some ways, lives and demands on their time. If you look at the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, if you look at the data from the United Nations, one of the things that's really striking is the ways in which the demands on women's time haven't in fact changed in nearly 50 years. We spend as much time now doing housework, child rearing and emotional work with those around us as we did 50 years ago. And add on to that our presence and paid labor, what you get is women who are really in some ways time constrained. And I think that drives a lot of our demands about technology.

I think in some ways those attempts are heading in the right direction but they're profoundly misguided. Women and I'd argue many men, know that how they look, how they conduct themselves, how they dress, how they're augmented impacts how people make sense of them. And it's part and parcel of how people know how to reach you in the world. And technologies have become part of that ensemble, if you will. I mean, they've become part of how we're made sense of, they're part of our identities. Particularly small mobile devices. Mobile phones, cameras, mp3 players, there's a whole constellation of technologies that we carry with us now, that have become ways by which people make sense of us. ALEX COHEN, host : What's been the biggest surprise to you in all this research that you've done? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : I shall think the biggest surprise to me came about three and a half years ago when we were doing some work on early adopters of Wi-Fi technology and wireless technology.

And today is another day, a brighter day on Wall Street. Friday was not pretty. The DOW plunged nearly 400 points, oil prices increased. Well, today both trends reversed slightly. Nobody, though, thinks the economy's problems are over. In fact, an analyst with the global investment firm Black Rock predicted today that the credit crunch could be with us for at least another two years. John Dimsdale is here now from Marketplace. John, at least another two years? That means more, possibly? JOHN DIMSDALE : Yes, yes. It's particularly gloomy. This was a prediction made today by Bob Doll he's the vice chairman and the manager of funds for Black Rock. And they're in the business of offering institutional and retail investors forecasts of future economic performance. He was on a trip to Singapore and told reporters that banks still have several years worth of problems with bad mortgages. Foreclosures, he says, will continue to create losses and they'll in turn, make banks skittish about making new loans and that is going to slow down other ways of borrowing, consumer loans, auto loans, even credit card loans for another two to four years. ALEX COHEN : So, what does this mean for us? For consumers? JOHN DIMSDALE : Well, it means a higher cost of borrowing and it will make it tougher for American shoppers to keep spending the way they have. And you know, they've really been the pillar of strength, keeping the U.S. economy going since the technology bust around the turn of the century. I checked in Steven Moore, an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal. He's not quite as pessimistic as Bob Doll, but Moore does worry that the borrowing crunch is going to create more problems. Mr. STEVEN MOORE (Editorial Writer, Wall Street Journal) : Americans are now starting to pull back a little bit on their consumption because they are feeling like the amount of money that they have in the bank is starting to shrink and the danger is that if the crises gets worse, then you could see a real pull back in consumer spending and that would lead to a much more negative situation than we are facing at the very moment. \n\n ###",

NPR's Scott Horsley, he watched a victorious Barack Obama today give a speech in Washington. Scott, welcome back. Senator Obama was speaking to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, that's a major organization for a traditional Democratic group that's been a little nervous about him, American Jews. What did he say? HORSLEY : That's right, Alex. And the first thing Obama did, in an effort to reassure Jewish voters, is to just give a straightforward declaration of his unqualified support for Israel. He also talked in sort of personal terms about his own understanding of the Jewish state, which he got from a camp counselor as a child. He talked about the history of Jews and African-Americans standing shoulder-to-shoulder, even shedding blood together during the civil rights struggle.

But if anybody's been confused by these emails, I want you to know that today, I'll be speaking from my heart - and as a true friend of Israel. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Scott, it was Senator McCain speaking to this same group on Monday, and he was very critical of Senator Obama for his willingness to negotiate with Iran's president. So did the senator speak about that today? Was there a response on that point? HORSLEY : Yes, Senator Obama said he was hesitant to be too partisan because he didn't want anyone watching in this country of another country to think that America's support for Israel was somehow a partisan thing. He said it crosses party lines; both Democrats and Republicans support Israel. And he acknowledged that Iran is a serious threat throughout the Middle East. But he also argued that Senator McCain's policy, in particular McCain's ongoing support for the Iraq War, have not made either Israel or the United States more safe. Senator BARACK OBAMA (Democrat, Illinois) : Senator McCain refuses to understand or acknowledge the failure of the policy he would continue. He criticizes my willingness to use strong diplomacy, but offers only an alternate reality - one where the war in Iraq has somehow put Iran on its heels. The truth is the opposite. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And you know, these events are scheduled, I guess, months in advance, so the speaker following Senator Obama was Hillary Clinton. She spoke just moments after he did - didn't begin her speech with any reference to the events of yesterday, didn't in any way concede her role as a Democratic candidate.

But then she did pivot a bit and tried to reassure the AIPAC audience that Barack Obama shares her unqualified support for Israel now and forever, she said. Senator HILLARY CLINTON (Democrat, New York) : It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him. It is an honor to call him my friend. And let me be very clear, I know that Senator Obama will be a good friend to Israel. HORSLEY : Senator Clinton also gave a partisan plug for electing a Democrat in November, whichever Democrat may be on the ballot, and she said it's not just Israel that faces challenges. She said the U.S. can only be a strong ally to Israel if it gets stronger here at home and strengthens its reputation in the world. I should say, by the way, that Senator Obama certainly congratulated Clinton for the way she had run the campaign, as did Senator McCain today.

Mr. RICHARD BRENNEMAN (Journalist) : I went, whoa, Your Honor, that's your decision, that's not mine. I'm a reporter, I can't advise you on something like that. I hadn't been covering courts that long, but I knew a decision by a judge was supposed to be a decision by a judge and was not to take in any advice from any other person other than what was there on the law books, what had been entered into evidence in the case. Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I mean it's all this kind of manipulation of how these cases work.

He's told by his lawyer, you know, keep your chin up, this is it. At the end of this you are going to be free because, basically, that's what the judge told the lawyers. And the judge calls the lawyers into chambers and says, I've changed my mind. You know, I want him to go back to jail, or I want him to be deported. I mean, he was just kind of spouting whatever. I don't think he knew what to do. And in the end, Polanski ended up not knowing what was ahead of him. And you know, I don't want to give the movie away but, you know, he flees. MADELEINE BRAND, host : What do the principals say now? What does the prosecutor say now about it? Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I was quite shocked when the prosecutor in the case said to me in the interview, I'm not surprised that he left under those circumstances. It's a very telling moment in the film just because he's come full circle to being on the same side as Polanski's attorney because of the judge's actions. It's in no way forgiving Polanski, but it's explaining why he fled. MADELEINE BRAND, host : You also interview the victim in this, Samantha Geimer, who for many, many years she was unknown to most people. Her name wasn't out there. What did she have to say about all this? Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I'm quite impressed with Samantha Geimer because she is over this. I think she's made peace with it. I think she wants to move on. I think, ironically, her lawyer wanted a plea bargain because he didn't want her to forever be known as the girl who had sex with Roman Polanski. But ironically she is. And she's a happily-married mother of three, very sunny and clear-eyed, and just wants it to be finished. \n\n ###",

Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I ended up approaching Polanski at the end of production, and it took a very long time to get a response. I told him that I wanted to interview him. And he was very apologetic, and said he didn't want to be a prima donna, but he just felt that he shouldn't be in the film.

Honestly, I mean, it's never just enough. So, I think he feels that he went through the process and pled guilty and went through the probation report and went to what was to be considered his jail time.

You know, you feel sorry for him as a kid and what he endured. You feel sorry for him with regard to the Sharon Tate murder. But then he committed a horrific crime on a 13-year-old girl. But it was 30 years ago. And I'm not saying that we need to forgive him, I'm not saying that at all.

Coming up, consulting a psychic to find out what is the new what, but before we go there, is everybody happy? Mr. PETER MEHLMAN (Former \"Seinfeld\" Writer) : There's a guy in my neighborhood. When asked, how are you? He always says, I'm really happy. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Former \"Seinfeld\" writer and Day to Day contributor, Peter Mehlman, has been thinking about bliss. Mr. PETER MEHLMAN (Former \"Seinfeld\" Writer) : Every time I hear this I think the guy should be put on suicide watch.  Or maybe he really is happy and simply lacks the grace to keep it to himself. But then, my attitude on this one is out of step with America.  The truth is, one little nitpick the world has with us is that America is the happiest country on Earth and ultimately, nothing offends people like seeing others being happy.  The world's dose of us is just potent enough to give the impression of an incorrigibly joyous, soda-sipping, hammy power nation of sports fans whose team never loses. Mr. PETER MEHLMAN (Former \"Seinfeld\" Writer) : They don't see the \"Blue Velvet\" scene under every small town or the homeless drift in the cities, but then neither do we. We are so committed to happiness, we ignore the overtly miserable.  Our feeling is no, there but for the grace of god go you. I'm fine. This all started with the Founding Fathers who, in one of their rare Pollyanna moments, granted us the pursuit of happiness, 230 years later we're still running with it and our economy is still riding on it. \n\n ###",

Old Navy isn't dressing you for Chapter 11.  Harley Davidson isn't telling you that life is all about killing time between meals.  Forget that getting there is half the agony.  All that matters is you can get there.  This belief is so strong that happiness is our society's great equalizer.  A laid off Wal-Mart clerk with varicose veins in his eyes living in a suburb of Podunk can see George Clooney on a red carpet arm in arm with Venus and ask, yeah, but is he happy?  Personally he looks pretty damn happy to me but again, I'm out of step with our gleeful democracy, although sometimes I do try to get in step. Mr. PETER MEHLMAN (Former \"Seinfeld\" Writer) : Like recently at the airport I was picking up my car from long term parking, which always sounds to me an insider's term for a cemetery but anyway, I was really kind of happy to be home.  So happy that after posting bail for my car, I said to the cashier, have a great day.  I got to say, such cheeriness felt nice, so I drove off trying to keep in touch with it.  To keep that feeling of happiness, to be in the happy moment.  After all, I thought, in America happy is supposed to be normal. Which of course, led me to the one thought shared by everyone in the world, what's it like to be normal? Which led me to the thought, have a great day?  She's a cashier, what are the odds? Which led me to a final thought, it's good to be home. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Comedy writer Peter Mehlman.

Hope is, after all, Obama's mission and message to deal with a wide range of huge, complex problems facing the nation. Doesn't a Cosmo-Clinton seem like the least of Obama's problems? The answer is simple. It's time to have an electronic monitoring bracelet attached to Bill Clinton's ankle.

That's where former Washington Post reporter Patrice Gaines wrote today's Snapshot. Patrice remembers how generations of good cooking shaped her own sense of family. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : My grandmother made perfect biscuits - soft, flaky, golden on top. She made big pans of her biscuits for me whenever I visited her in Washington, D.C. She pulls them out of the oven and placed them lovingly on a dinner plate. She'd bring them to me along with a smaller saucer, a bottle of dark caramel syrup or Brer Rabbit Molasses. I'd slather the biscuits with butter, poured syrup or molasses into the saucer and use the bread to sop it up. I was in my 20s. I didn't have to think about my waistline. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : As the years past and I got older, I tried to replicate granny's bread. But my biscuits were too heavy - thicker than they should be. They didn't fall apart in my mouth like they were supposed to, like every biscuit granny ever made. One day, with a pencil and notebook in my hand, I led granny into the kitchen and said, please teach me how to make biscuits like you. I stood next to her -close enough to smell her Chanel No. 5 perfume and nearly brush her arms. I love to rub those plump arms. I love the way her flesh was always cool to the touch. She was wearing her usual at-home attire - one of her floral house coats and her hair net though her short hair was always pressed perfectly in place. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : From her cabinet, she pulled out all of the ingredients she needed. You put this much flour in the bowl, she said. She poured flour into the big green glass bowl. How much flour is that, I asked? I don't know, she said, nonchalantly. Here, hold the bowl and see how it feels. I was flabbergasted. I didn't know how to write that in a recipe. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : At that moment, I saw the most delicious biscuits I would ever eat slipping away from me and out of my life. We had those biscuits every Thanksgiving until 1985 - the year granny died after suffering a series of strokes. When she left our lives, we lost so many things - her giggle that quickly built into a hardy round laugh that made everyone else laugh, too. The grandmother who pressed coins into the palms of her grandchildren's hands on nearly every visit. The shop dresser who had her hats made by a milliner, And the biscuits left our family, too, forever. Granny left before teaching her daughter, my mother, how to make biscuits. \n\n ###",

His name is Hakeem Jeffries; he's on the line now from New York. He's a Democratic New York State assemblyman from Brooklyn. And Assemblyman, you and Senator Obama - you two share a lot of similarities. Tell us, what's your background? Assemblyman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (Brooklyn, New York City, New York) : Well, I was raised in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from college, went on to graduate school, law school, practiced law for several years and then in 2006, was elected to represent several neighborhoods in Brooklyn in the New York State Assembly. MADELEINE BRAND, host : But you share a similar political philosophy, correct? Assemblyman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (Brooklyn, New York City, New York) : Well, absolutely. I think it was particularly inspiring to me when I had run for office. Initially I challenged an incumbent, came out of an insurgent movement much like Senator Obama did in Chicago. And some folks said, well, someone with a name like Hakeem Jeffries, you might have a problem getting elected in my little assembly district in Brooklyn, but it became clear to me that if a Barack Obama could be elected to the United State Senate, first out of Illinois, and then secure the nomination last night for a major political party, that certainly anything was possible. So it's inspiring for me, it was inspiring for my two young sons. I think it was inspiring for a lot of African-Americans across this country in terms of what's possible.

And I wasn't at home yesterday because we're in session in Albany, but I talked to my oldest son and told him that today was the day, it appeared, that Senator Obama would become the nominee. And he's followed this campaign, he's known that he was competing against someone named Hillary Clinton, and that whoever won was going to then face John McCain to become the president. And I could tell that there was a gleam in his voice as a result of what I projected to my son would be this primary victory. MADELEINE BRAND, host : What about emotionally? How is it for you seeing this historic moment, an African-American man, achieve their party's nomination? Assemblyman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (Brooklyn, New York City, New York) : I'm very optimistic about where we go as a country in the future, because folks under 45 have not been through the same racial wars as those in the older generations and I really believe see the country, see our communities through a lens that is increasingly color-blind. And that is perhaps one of the reasons why Senator Obama has done so well, particularly with younger Americans. MADELEINE BRAND, host : He does, though, still have that problem with older, white, working- class voters. Assemblyman HAKEEM JEFFRIES (Brooklyn, New York City, New York) : I think he can increasingly connect with white,working-class voters on issues which are important to them. The Republicans often, I believe, have gotten folks to vote against their own economic interests by using wedge cultural issues, sometimes wedge racial issues, sometimes promoting foreign policy fears. But we have an important opportunity this year to change all of that, to move in a different direction. \n\n ###",

So if something was to happen or if you didn't like the goods that you bought, you have other protections in place. Something else to look out for, the season is running rampant with what is called fishing scams. And this really means a couple of things. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Number one, just do not click links in an e-mail. I know you've seen this e-mail, Farai. You know, they come out and they say, hey, click here for a special discount at what seems to be a respected outlet. And you click that link and you'll land on the Web site and it looks totally legit. They've copied it from corner to corner of the screen, but it, in fact, is a sight that's capturing any personal identifiable information that you may place into the site. So don't click on any links in any e-mails. Use one credit card for all your cyber shopping and then make sure that the Web site is secure. Look in the top bar where it says http and look for the S to make sure the site is secure. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So now that we have our safety tips, what are we going to spend our money on? MARIO ARMSTRONG : Ah, so - too many choices out there. I mean, everything from - the hottest things that you're going to see, really, this season are large screen televisions, people are really interested in making that purchase and are looking for good deals on that. But handheld devices like smartphones are always on the top category. Digital cameras, mp3 players are number one on the list again this year. And what rounds out kind of the top five are GPS devices. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we've talked a little bit about this conversion to HDTV, but buying a flat screen doesn't have that much to do with it. I'm sure that most of the ones now are HD. Is that - well, actually maybe I'm not sure. What do you think about that? \n\n ###",

That's a great point. I mean there's a lot of confusing going on in this whole market about television. High definition is kind of like the Cadillac or, I don't know, BMW, top of the line for your television screens. So you do need to be educated when you're going shopping to make sure you are, in fact, getting an HDTV if you are intending to watch HD television programming.

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Someone told me that one of them you shouldn't lay flat after you use it and then all these rules. What's the difference? What's the pro? What's the con? MARIO ARMSTRONG : You need to know the environment where the TV is going to be. That's number one. Is the room a dark room? Does it have a lot of natural light? Will it be in a sun room? If it's in a dark space, Plasmas do excellent in dark rooms. They're great for movie buffs and to really mimic that home theater experience. \n\n ###",

In other words, actually take a tape measure and measure the distance of where the television will be to where you'll be watching it from and any angles that you may be watching the television from. And take those measurements and the tape measure with you to the store because all of the televisions don't look the same and some have - some you can't even notice what's on the screen when you start getting into a 45 or more degree angle.

I normally don't recommend this, but I think people should budget this into the cost of a television because we don't really know. These televisions and technology is still fairly new.

You must have had to work a lot of stuff out in order to be able to have your sustained, civil discourse with all the members of your family. What happened or helped you at moments when your tempers were frayed? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : I don't know that it's temper as much as frustration. And I worked for my brother at Broadway Federal Bank, and it's the kind of thing where, you know, sometimes it's not a decision I want made. I come from a family who's very chauvinistic and, you know, the men sort of run things when it comes to business. But, on the other hand, my brother has been very generous in allowing me in my creativity, allowing me an opportunity to participate in decision making. So it's frustration that never carries over. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Do you have any advice if you have lost your temper, and I'm not saying you ever have, but if you do lose your temper, what's the protocol then? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Well, I've had and I've also worked with other relatives, you know, not at the bank necessarily, but you lose your temper. And I don't think it's any different than any other situation. There's a way to handle everything. For me, it's not cussing and fussing. I will make my point known. I will make it known at the appropriate time. And the one thing with family business is you don't do it with an audience. I think it says what Joyce said earlier: You take it aside, you do it in different position. My brother is generous enough that it's not even if you don't disagree, it's like we didn't get that assignment, and he's never going to ask me about it in the family dinner. Never. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, LaJoyce, what about you?

We call family meetings. We - we're scattered about the country, so we don't have the luxury of being in the same city. There are a nest of us that are still in Chicago. I'm not in Chicago anymore. But - and they do see one another regularly, but we are a family who has always been encouraged to let it out, let it go and let God. And so in that, we don't - with my immediate family - I have six brothers and two sisters and I have probably 32 nieces and nephews and 10 great nieces and nephews. So we are crew.

We believe that it takes an entire village to raise a child, and I was - grew up in a unique neighborhood in Chicago on the South side. Our block, we still have several families who were there when I was raised there and the children have now bought houses on the block. And if people die, they still buy - other people in the families buy the houses. So we have a very tight-knit community.

Well, one person, Ms. Alice from down the block, had four of the children, like our kids, by the hands bringing each of them to the center of the street and made them apologize and, you know, for the infraction that they had created.

It's also language coming out in the middle of negotiations between the two campaigns, negotiations that are going on in both real time and also in the press. And it's also a sign of confusion. One of the big thing that's up in the air is the question of does Barack Obama have the actual numbers? And that will push Senator Clinton, I think, one way or the other if by the time she's giving his speech he's gotten over that important threshold number. And we'll just have to see if that happens. ALEX CHADWICK, host : This number is 2,118, that's the number of total delegates that you will need now to win the nomination in the Democratic Party, that's the number. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : That's exactly right, and Obama will get to that number. It's just a question of whether he gets to it tonight. You know part of this, the parsing, is about what Senator Clinton will say tonight in her speech after these primary results come in. And if by that hour the magical number has been reached that will affect the speech in one way. If that magical number isn't reached until, say, tomorrow, a few more superdelegates come out, then that changes what Clinton may be forced to say when she speaks tonight. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John, we do know that Senator Clinton has plans for this big event in New York tonight, this speech you've referred to. She's called in supporters and big donors from all around the country - invited them to come to this event. There are reports that word has gone out to staff that they have one more week left and then the campaign is not going to be paying them any longer. What are they waiting for? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Well, they are waiting, both sides are waiting, as you point out, it's over. Now the question is just how to manage the end. And there are a couple of constituencies here. One, Clinton wants to have maybe some of her debts paid off. There are a lot of rumors going around. So - there's a question of her debts. There's also a question of her supporters, some of the African-American supporters, have taken a lot of flack for supporting her and not Barack Obama. Then there's the question of the vice presidency. Will she be offered it? \n\n ###",

And then there are all kinds of other issues, including will Barack Obama say anything, perhaps, to tamp down or absolve Bill Clinton of some of the things he's said that have been perceived by some people to have a kind of racial tinge to them? Lots of issues to be played out there. Barack Obama doesn't want to force Clinton's hand too much. He knows it's over, he knows he's got the numbers. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : In fact, one of the ways he'll be evaluated by her supporters, many of whom have raised the charge of sexism, is how he handles her exit from the race. Is he sufficiently gracious? Does he being this party healing process that everyone's desperate, everyone in the Democratic Party anyway, is desperate to have begin. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Senator Obama is holding a rally in St. Paul, Minnesota tonight. That's where he's going to be, not in Montana or South Dakota, but St. Paul, Minnesota. What is the point of that? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Well, I'm actually with Senator Obama in Chicago right now. He's flying at the end of the day to Minnesota. That's where the Republicans will hold their convention. Minnesota is a swing state. And Obama is going there to basically kick off his general election campaign. He's had lots of little mini kickoffs, he's really been in a fight more with John McCain, much more so than Hillary Clinton. But this is an attempt for him to being telling the story that will consume us for the rest of the election year as we go into the general election. So he's going there and he'll talk about bringing people together. He'll talk about, you know, he's in a swing state so he has to be there to kind of fight for that state that will be important in the battleground map for the general election. And he wants to set the themes on his own terms for that general election battle with John McCain. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John Dickerson, from Slate.com, with Senator Obama on his way to Minnesota.

One, I take my responsibility as superdelegate very seriously and that responsibility is to act according to my judgment as to what would be best for the Democratic Party and the nation.

I would watch the data very, very carefully, and I came to the conclusion that we will not win with Senator Obama if he is our candidate. Hillary Clinton is substantially stronger when you look at the analysis that shows how they fare in each state according to that state's Electoral College votes. Because as you know, the popular vote does not elect a president. Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : We found that out, unfortunately, at the beginning of the Bush years, in my opinion. The Electoral College vote does, and Hillary Clinton is very strong, and she easily beats McCain and this has been consistent. Putting that hard data together with my judgment and my gut based on about 30 years in political life, 30 years of interacting with people in politics, I just felt that Hillary Clinton is the much stronger candidate.

And a night's sleep, and then woke up and thought, well, you know, I need to think about this, this morning, and started thinking about it, but I needed some free time, frankly. I mean, I kept coming back to the fact that Obama started with a 50-state strategy and was willing to go early into relatively tough territory where we for the last number of years have not really been contesting seats, and dig out Democrats and organize them.

Williams co-founded the notorious Crips gang. He'd been on death row since the early 1980s for four murders, he says, he did not commit. And that was just part of the controversy over whether Williams was unrepentant or uniquely valuable in the fight against gang violence. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : By time he died, he had committed himself to nonviolence and gang prevention. He wrote children's books. He was even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Two years after his death, Williams' new autobiography has hit stores. It's called \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption.\" Author Barbara Becnel, a close friend of Williams, edited the memoir and wrote the epilogue. I asked her why Williams focused so much of the book on his childhood in South Central Los Angeles. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : It's just simply no doubt that the public school system failed Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams because it turns out, these many years later, he's tested for an IQ test and it turns out he's borderline genius, that the public school system in South Central Los Angeles in the late - mid-1960s and it did fail Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams. So - I mean, that's just the truth of it. But I guess he was just a symbol. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : This book really details how he went from someone who helped found the Crips, and then to move on once he went to prison to write children's books. I want to walk us through a couple of the different phases of his life. First of all, why don't you tell us why you think the Crips got started based on what Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams told you? \n\n ###",

And so - but it was overrun with gangs even prior to the Crips being formed. So what happened was both he and Raymond Lee Washington decided to get together and form a gang that would protect them and their friends and their family members from the gangs that were ruling the streets of both the Eastside of L.A. and the Westside of L.A. in the black community. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : So in that sense then, they started off as a self-policing entity. But albeit, they - what he conceded is that it didn't take long before the Crips then became the very thing that - and behaving in the very same way as the gangs that the Crips formed - to protect themselves from. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : From that, he was convicted. What were the crimes that he was convicted for? He always maintained that he did not commit those crimes. Explain them. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : Okay. He was convicted in 1981 of committing four murders during two robberies that occurred in 1979. And so he said right up until the, literally the day and the hour that he died - an hour before he died, I was talking to him on the phone - and he said, he did not commit these crimes. But - so that is what he said. And he - in his book, he talks about how the people who are oppositional to him say that he didn't deserve clemency or that he couldn't possibly be redeemed because he did not acknowledged and apologized for those crimes. And he says, in the book, it would be cowardly for him to confess to something he didn't do.

For many years, I have shouldered the heavy encumber of this madness that perpetuates your sorrow. Your suffering has not gone unnoticed. I acknowledged it. I feel it. With humility, I express my deepest remorse for each of you for having help to create this bloody and violent legacy.

And though it's two and a half years after the fact, they can still benefit from his message. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Towards the end of his book, the very end, he talks about being free in spirit, if not in body. And he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize multiple times. What do you think his legacy is? Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : I think his legacy is several fold. One, he did end up being an anti-gang activist and a peacemaker over the last 13 or 14 years of his life. And it's really made a difference. For example, the day after his memorial service, a handful of Crips said the following - the governor wouldn't give my homey a clemency, but we have the power to give each other clemency by stopping the killing of each other. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : They formed a cease-fire committee. And now, two years later, it's about 250 Crip leaders strong and they have - those 250 Crip factions or sets have quit killing each other and the goal is to expand it to Bloods, and the goal is to ultimately expand it to Latino gangs in South Central and throughout the nation. \n\n ###",

And with that dictionary, he learned the words that he needed to understand in order to read books and history books and black history books and that really changed his life.

And that - it occurred to him, okay, I'm ordinary and I can work hard and I could reach out and do some extraordinary things.

Maps, do that as well. People who are braving the airports should, of course, check their respective airline Web sites to check for flight delays, and the Web site flyfaa.gov can give you real-time information about backups at your local airport. GEOFFREY BENNETT : And if you're not in front of the computer, you can do what I do: I text Google at no additional cost. You enter the flight delay - you enter the flight number and the airline name and send it to 46645 or G-O-O-G-L, Googl, and a couple of seconds, you get a text back with all you need to know. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Wow. All right. Well, finally, this Friday, retailers across the country will be offering up doorbuster deals in order to draw people in. There's something similar on the Web, right? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Yeah, it's called Cyber Monday. It's the Monday following Black Friday, and folks who want to avoid the crowds can find great deals online. Shop.org., it's a site that studies retailing trends, says 75 percent of Web retailers are going to offer deals next week and there's - their Web site cybermonday.com that lists some of them. And so all the Web sites I mentioned can be found on our blog, News & Views. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : All right. Well, Geoffrey, thanks a lot. \n\n ###",

We asked some of our regular contributors to share their favorite Thanksgiving Day moments. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : First, here's political analyst Robert Traynham. Mr. ROBERT TRAYNHAM (Political Analyst) : Sitting down with my family on Thanksgiving Day with the football game on in the background, laughing, joking, eating way too much food, and really just reflecting on what family really means and love and friendship and respect. You know, Thanksgiving for me is a period of time where you sit back and reflect, not only about your life, but also about what family means and what love means. And so, that's what I'm going to be doing, is really just spending some good quality time and making sure that my family members know that I deeply care for them a lot. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist) : There's a large extended family of people who come to Winston Salem, North Carolina to celebrate Thanksgiving with Dr. Maya Angelou, and I'm privileged to be part of that extended family. That will be how I'm spending Thanksgiving and looking forward to just a warm, wonderful reunion with so many people who've been so important in my life. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist) : I have one memory that I enjoy about 10 years ago when I did my first Thanksgiving dinner at my home and had a tableful of people, and it actually turned out quite well. I was a little bit surprised given my culinary skills, but I have a picture, and I couldn't even put the year on it. We were just all sort of sitting there, kicking back, every body, really friendly conversation, just really appreciating the value of family. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And here's essayist Jeff Obafemi Carr. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Author) : There was this one Thanksgiving holiday that we all decided to go and visit in Columbus, Georgia with some of my mom's relatives - a really small community, small neighborhood, not much to do, so me and some of the older cousins and my brother-in-law, we started walking through the neighborhood, and we saw a basketball court. So, of course, we went over to play basketball and there were a bunch of teenage boys there thinking they were Michael Jordan. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Author) : So, of course, they see the old cats coming and they want to challenge us to play a game of basketball. So we said, well, sure thing. So we lined up on either side and started playing basketball. And what do you know, we whipped the crap out of those kids. So they got angry and they said, no, you can't leave; you've got to play us again. And we played them again; we played them two more times, and we beat them. And they didn't realize it's because each one of them was trying to show off their basketball skills and we were setting picks and boxing out and doing things that old, slow guys do when they have to learn a game of basketball against kids, so we beat them soundly. And as we limped back to the house feeling full of pride, we just remembered that that was a great day when the old guys won. So we had a big dinner and we all went to sleep, and it's probably one of the best Thanksgivings I've had. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (Correspondent, Newsweek) : It's funny, my favorite Thanksgiving Day memory is not really - it's on Thanksgiving, but it really is with my grandmother. On Thanksgiving Day, they - she always wanted us, after dinner, after the turkey, after we were full, to go upstairs in the attic and get down Mary, Jesus and Joseph. That was her thing. That as soon as Thanksgiving, you know, dinner was over, we had to go up and get those, you know, plastic, sort of models of Mary, Jesus and Joseph, so we could set them up because she wanted all that time for it to be out in her yard. \n\n ###",

It was a very small kitchen and a little eating area. And mom and I would sit at our table, and my job, primarily, was to pull the edges off the bread for my mother's dressing. My mother made this homemade stuffing, no stovetop, homemade stuffing, and I would just sit there with her. But what was really sweet about it was that's when we would really talk, and it would go on until late in the night. My sisters were in bed. My father might have been out somewhere with his friends, but mom and I would just sit in that hot, little kitchen talking. And sometimes we'd get so hot that we had this big stone that we would sit in our door to keep the door open to bring a breeze in. And it might be 2:00 in the morning, and mom and I would just sit and talk and prepare the meal and break the eggs and, you know, just get ready for dinner. Ms. BETTY BAYE (Reproter, The Courier-Journal) : And I really, really miss that. I miss my mother so terribly. She was my best friend in the whole world. And Thanksgivings are just not the same since mom's been gone, but I do have that sweet memory of the two of us - just giggling and laughing and getting ready for dinner.

Former presidential speechwriter David Frum joins us by phone in Barcelona, where he is today. David, what did you think of that speech? Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Well, the McCain speech as a document was just terrific. It hit every point that John McCain needed to hit. And it did something very subtle.  While paying lots of compliments to Barack Obama personally, it dealt with the age issue that Obama subtlety raises against John McCain all the time by complimenting him on his half century of service to the country. John McCain raised it by saying, well, Barack Obama may be young, but his ideas are old. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I heard him say, it's surprising to hear a young man turn to the past for failed ideas. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Exactly. Now, the only thing that could have made the speech better is if we lived in an age where people absorbed political oratory from the newspaper because when you read the speech, it's just a perfect document. Unfortunately, we've invented radio and television and people hear it and see it, and it was not delivered with the kind of power and conviction that a speech so powerful and conviction-filled ought to have been delivered with. \n\n ###",

Senator McCain is a - enormously sympathetic political figure for many, many Americans, but as an orator, as someone who has to get up and excite a crowd, he's not a match as a candidate for Senator Obama. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : No, but he really doesn't need to be. I mean, I have a very simple map of what I think is happening in this election. The country is ready for a change and is ready to sweep out the incumbent party, the Republicans, if the alternative is acceptable. And the great question over the rest of the election is, is the alternative acceptable? And John McCain is John McCain. He is very much a known quantity. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : They know he was right about the war, and they know he got the tactics right. The surge was his idea. They know he is not on top of this economic issue and that's a problem, but he's known, and they respect his integrity and his record. Now you have this other candidate who is much less known and then you have this third force, Hillary Clinton, who I thought last night was sort of vowing to conduct a guerilla warfare campaign - we've lost the main battles, but I'm going to lead my band of party fighters up in to the hills and the war continues. And depending on how destructive she is, she may play a major part in convincing the country that the alternative to the incumbent is unacceptable, or at least impossible. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You write in the National Review online today that she may be campaigning for the vice presidency and if she is, that Senator Obama would find it almost impossible to say no, but very inadvisable to say yes. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Look, Mitt Romney is campaigning for the vice presidency. He's going around the country. He's making speeches. He's saying nice things about John McCain. Hillary Clinton is doing a little bit more than that. She's got 2,000 delegates or thereabouts. She is delivering a speech - I'm not giving up. Now, the question she is posing to Obama is, nice little convention you are going to have there in Denver, it would be a true misfortune if it were to be ruined by a whole series of challenges over credentials of Michigan and Florida. \n\n ###",

If, as the saying goes, journalism is the first draft of history, you watched it being drafted last night as the media focused on the conclusion of the primary season. NPR's David Folkenflik is with us from New York. David, what about the TV networks watching Barack Obama's moment approach? DAVID FOLKENFLIK : It felt a little bit like the countdown to New Year's in 2000 where, you know, you knew what was going to happen, you knew roughly when it would happen, and you were sort of watching it tick downward. You saw slightly different counts on the different networks. Fox News, I believe relying on the Associated Press, called it pretty early. But if you watched MSNBC and CNN, they both had slightly different delegate countdowns. And then as somebody else would announce either on their air or throw out a statement you know, that they had switched support or were coming out for Senator Obama, suddenly you'd see the breaking news (unintelligible) appear, and they would say hey, we're getting that much closer. It was also interesting to see a little bit of difference in tones. DAVID FOLKENFLIK : If you turned on CNN, you saw a lot of the minutia of the politicking and positioning. MSNBC might have emphasized slightly more of the notion of this being a historic moment. Fox News commentators were more quickly pivoting to the notion of well, in the general election, how is Senator Obama going to be able to dispel these unsavory associations, to shed this taint that may have somehow accompanied - from the controversies about his former pastor. And so it was interesting to see the slightly different aspects play out. ALEX CHADWICK, host : It was really the Associated Press, you mentioned them earlier, that set the tone for the day. DAVID FOLKENFLIK : Yeah, well, and this was a very interesting thing. It's a little glimmer of an insight into how the media works. A little before 11 o'clock, about 10:50 or so, the Associated Press put out a bulletin, and it started \"Officials say Hillary Rodham Clinton will acknowledge tonight that Barack Obama has the delegates for the nomination.\" \n\n ###",

If you watched her speech, she didn't do that at all. The AP's language sort of shifted over the course of the day. Late in the day, they reported that she'd changed her mind. That she wouldn't be doing that. And then in fact, there was almost instant pushback from some of her most senior aides, like Harold Ickes and Terry McAuliffe. The AP really is - you know - is the wire that serves almost every major media outlet in the country. It really set the tone in the scramble, making it even tougher for the Clinton camp to claim that there was any suspense in what was going to happen. ALEX CHADWICK, host : What about today as you go forward? DAVID FOLKENFLIK : Well, I think it's worth taking a moment. You know, I was born in 1969. On my 18th birthday, my grandfather Jack Pearlstein (ph) gave me a gift and he told me, imagine something impossible. And I couldn't fathom what he was getting at. Well, I opened the present and it was a copy of the New York Times from the day man walked on the moon. I realized for him this was impossible. For me, it was something I took almost a little bit for granted. DAVID FOLKENFLIK : If you look at a lot of headlines today, you think of the Chicago Tribune, Obama's home paper, of course. But it - the headline is \"Obama Makes History.\" And the subhead on one of the stories was \"It Would Not Have Been Possible 40 Years Ago.\" It is sort of a moment. Senator Clinton did not concede the nomination, it's important to acknowledge that, but nonetheless, he is over the tipping point. And I think there's probably a lot of parents and a lot of grandparents who, whatever one thinks of Senator Obama, whether he turns out to be a successful candidate - or should he win, a successful president. A lot of people may well save their newspapers this morning with that kind of historic headline my grandfather gave me those years ago.

Also know that there are seven calories per gram of alcohol in every serving. So it is not a free as you would - if you would. It's not a free beverage, so - it's not a calorie-free beverage. So, given that you're never going to achieve the feeling that you enjoyed with the first glass, after that, you might want to put the cork back in the burgundy. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How do you pick yourselves up? I mean, Beverly, even you, although you've had a surgery, you probably had moments of weakness. If you do something that you don't consider perfect, how do you pick yourself up? Ms. ARNOLD : You know, and I do give in to cravings at times. What I found that - sometimes - one day, I'd have such a horrible craving for ice cream, and I'm not a sweet eater. I don't care that much for ice cream, but I got a little container of ice cream, I eat two teaspoons of it just to taste it, and put it back in the freezer. When my grandchildren came, I gave it to them. But when I mess up, I have to get right back on track immediately. \n\n ###",

MADELEINE BRAND, host : Finally, some relief from those relentless rise in oil prices. The price of a barrel of crude is now more than $10 below last month's record highs, but some industries are finding that the damage has already been done. They're making some big changes in the way they do business.  Joining us now is Marketplace's Bob Moon. Bob, first, why are oil prices falling now? BOB MOON : Well, hallelujah, Madeleine, crude does keep dropping. It's been trading at around $122 a barrel today. Compare that to the record high we saw just two weeks ago, when oil hit a record of $135.09a barrel. Some of this is driven by signals from the Fed, that it's through cutting interest rates for now. That could help shore up the value of the dollar, and that could help stabilize oil prices since most oil is priced in dollars. BOB MOON : But the big factor in today's price decline is the latest word that we've gotten from the Energy Department on gasoline demand. It says that there was a sharp fall-off last week, and demand's been declining over the past four weeks, really, by almost one and a half percent. That's helped push gasoline inventories up by almost 3 million barrels. Now that's more than three times the increase than analysts were generally expecting. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, if there is more gas, does that mean that the prices will go down? \n\n ###",

The average price for regular gas right now across the country has now hit a record of 3.98 a gallon. Many analysts think that's likely to hit four bucks in the coming days. Of course here in California, we're already paying well over that amount. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, what about these problems that the high oil prices are causing for certain businesses?  What's happening? BOB MOON : Well, the airline industry is really struggling with the cost of doing business and just today, we've gotten word from United that they're going to make aggressive moves to cope with fuel prices. They are cutting 1,100 more jobs, and United is going to ground 70 more of its fuel guzzlers. That means it's mothballing its entire fleet now of 94 Boeing 737s along with six 747s. And United's going to be cutting its mainline domestic capacity by up to 18 percent in the next year. And then move over to the auto industry. another sign of these belt-tightening times. The Ford F -series pick-up truck, it's been the best-selling vehicle in America for the past 17 years. Well, last month, it wasn't. The Honda Civic and the Accord and Toyota's Camry and Corolla all outsold Ford's pick-up. And then just yesterday, GM said it would be closing down some SUV plants. It's retooling to meet shifting consumer demands. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, is this temporary or long term, do you think, these changes? BOB MOON : Well, analysts and industry officials are telling us that these are fundamental changes in the ways these companies are going to be doing business. Here's how one auto market analyst puts it. He says he's never known the market to change this much, this quickly, in his lifetime. \n\n ###",

Absolutely. You know, I enjoyed family gatherings. In my family, I would never run from the table when we had the tourist conversation. You know, they always let me stick around for some reason. And I got to learn a lot about life. And when cousin Sheila(ph) had her problems and when cousin Sheila came around, I knew that we were going to, A, air dirty laundry and solve her problems. But what somebody would ultimately end up doing is - after the wisdom flew around the table, with all the gray hairs, then someone will go get the Bible to see what God had to say about it. So that's how all of the problems were solved in our family. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Karen, you may have a slightly different solution. \"Basic Black,\" the book that you wrote - when you think about the book that you wrote, trying to bring a little bit of order to the modern chaos around manners, how does that apply during the holidays? Is it any tougher, any different? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Well, I think it's tougher because the holidays represent the best and the worst of our childhood. It's all the food that we were happy to eat, and everybody comes home for, you know, grandma's sweet potato pies and somebody's macaroni and cheese. But it also has all the heartache and the things you remember about how somebody treated you when you were a child, and now you're an adult and you're coming home on a different kind of atmosphere. I come home a very different experience because I'm blessed to be a third generation living in the same town where the rest of my family is. So I see them on a regular basis. And I do not have one holiday where there was ever drama at the table. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : And perhaps that is because we were raised to care ourselves, like our grandmother was looking over our shoulder.

It's a time of celebration. And particularly, Thanksgiving is a time where you really do take note of what you're thankful for. And I think that one of the other things that I firmly believe is that, you know, we do need to take the commercialism out of the holiday season. I think that adds to a lot of the angst and a lot of the stress. You know, can I buy a good enough present? Do I get something for everybody? Is somebody going to buy me something?

Well, in 1990 I married a man who swept me off my feet and who came into my life like prince charming. And two years into the relationship, I discovered he had full-blown AIDS. And it wasn't until he was almost dead that I found out he knew he always had AIDS that he was always infected. I am victoriously negative. And - also, I didn't know until after he was dead that he was on the down low. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : So, yes, I burned the bridges because, well, he died and, you know, I refused to allow him to strangle me from the grave. I refused to not forgive him because, obviously, he didn't know any better, and because I'm God's girl for real, and to be exposed to the virus multiple occasions and to not become infected, I am completely God's girl. And so in that I knew that I couldn't harbor on to un-forgiveness. Also in my work as a naturopathic doctor, I understand that un-forgiveness is the emotional component of cancer. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And so, it wasn't worth holding on to this piece of something from - for a dead man. So I also buried his family when I buried him, especially his sisters who knew that he was infected when they stood up in my wedding. So I forgive them and have watched their lives completely fall apart. And so there are a few people in his family who I have chosen to have relationship with. And it is very comforting and a nurturing relationship on both parties as we have. And we enjoy each - one another's company. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I bring this up for two reasons. One is because your upcoming book is on this topic, but secondly, when we think about holidays, we think about memories. And what do you do with the memories of the holidays that you spent with your former husband? Do you try to erase them? Do you just acknowledge them and move on? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Mm-hmm. I acknowledge them and move on. Because the holiday season for him was tumultuous, so he brought in those feelings. His uneasiness and his conflict that was unsettled in his family, he brought that in - with him into our relationship. See that's the part about teaming up and marrying someone who you know him but you don't know him. \n\n ###",

We met and married within 11 months. So, you know, when you take the time to find out what a man's relationship is with his momma, you know, what his relationship with his sibling, and why do they have such a horrible, venomous relationship, and it's obviously because of family secrets, which ultimately steal, kill and destroy. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let me go to you, Karen, your mother being born on Christmas day as mine was, and we celebrate every year, does that add a level of expectation to the holiday that weighs it down or does it lift it up and make it something different? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Clearly, lifts it up. I think that when my mother after about 50 years said I'm not doing Christmas anymore so I inherited it. And every year, it's like how can I make it more special for mom. And mom grew up, you know, like your momma I'm sure never had a birthday party on her birthday with her friends. And my grandfather, my mother's father, just spoiled her rotten with the Christmas presents and the birthday presents. And when he passed, even though she was an adult, it was like, you know, the little kid in her came out. And so we go to great lengths to have a birthday cake to do all the things that she never had as a child.

So the people that really got us to think in different ways this year. So it was a pleasure to put together this list to salute, again, the people that you would expect, and also some surprises. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give me one of those surprises. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Ah, I think one of my favorites on the list is a woman named Gina McCauley, who is the blogger who founded the site whataboutourdaughters.com. And she's basically started a grassroots campaign, challenging some of the images, the negative images that we see in the media as it relates to African-American women. And this year, she successfully lobbied advertisers to pull out of the show that BET was putting on the air, \"Hot Ghetto Mess.\" \n\n ###",

Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : But probably, one of our most interesting packages this month has been about Africa, and it's called the Africa You Don't Know, where we really wanted to take an authentic look at the continent - and this was the beginning of an ongoing series throughout the year - and look at it beyond the issues we're all familiar with \u2014 poverty, violence, and things like that \u2014 and really looking at the almost normal regular sense of Africa, from kids playing to entertainment to booming issues with economics, and now the inclusion of China in the new economic development in many parts of Africa. \n\n ###",

So we felt it was important to sit down with Dr. Bynum and talk about her experience, but also hear the message that she wanted to share with women who might find themselves in similar situation.

Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Well, actually we have a coverage of both Kwanzaa and other religious aspects to the holiday season. Kwanzaa is in our December issue. We take a very different look at it. We decided to test question why we celebrate or, in many cases, why we don't celebrate Kwanzaa, the confusion in the African-American community about what Kwanza is and what it's not, you know, that is not a religious holiday per se as much as a celebration of our heritage; and why for many African-Americans it's almost like we feel like we should celebrate it, but we really don't know why, and so most of us don't. And so we take a look at that. And then we go and look at sort of the other side of the coin with a very, very practical look at why and how to read the Bible. Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Joy Benet takes a very hands-on, utilitarian guide to going chapter by chapter, book by book in the Bible on how to use it in your everyday life.

I know that right now, we're talking about wrapping up the year, but any time from January on, what was your favorite story that you covered or you helped put together this year? Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Well, that's a big question. We've had a some really great issues this year from our Barack and Michelle issue in February, where we hit the stands a week before he announced, with a great profile on them as a couple to - in May, I got to sit down and do the hard duty of spending a day or so with Halle Berry. And, of course, our July issue that we've decided to take all the pictures off the cover and take a serious look at the language of disrespected black American. \n\n ###",

And we got him to open up about a bunch of things, as well as a look back at the 25th anniversary of \"Thriller.\" Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : In spending three days with him, he is both complicated and in some ways not nearly as strange or as weird as people have painted him to be.

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Angela, what about you? What was your favorite moment over the year? Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : I think that, you know, it's been a really strong year for us, but I think I'm most proud about our political coverage this year. We've devoted unprecedented real estate and women's magazines to the conversation about the election. And we had interviews with Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And we felt like it was important to do this because statistics have shown that in the next election, in the African-American community, African black women will cast six out of ten votes. So, you know, we're a very influential voting bloc this term, and it's really important that the candidates speak directly to the issues that black America wants addressed.

Both of them have children that are ill. Holly's son is autistic and Lilly's daughter was brain damaged in a car accident. And it was just very emotional, sitting there, listening to these two women who I had never met before talk about what it's like to be the mother of a child who is ill and who necessarily won't get better. I think it put a lot of things into perspective, but also it was just interesting to see two women - one African-American, one not - bond so, you know, so quickly, and so many shared experiences that they had gone through with their children. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : And I think it just sort of gave me a new look at just sort of, you know, what's important and what's not because these are women who said most parents want their children to go to Harvard. They think that's like an accomplishment. But for them, you know, Lilly Tartikoff said her daughter, just being able to raise her head for, like, five minutes at a time was a thing that made her day. And, I don't know, I just felt like, you know, that was just an important story for people to see because, I think, sometimes we do take a lot of those kind of things for granted.

They have the information, and I've asked over and over again for them to do that for us, but they'll probably have two different pots of it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : They'll have the fat pot and the not-so-fat pot. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What's been the hardest thing for you about staying focused because it's clear that you have dedication? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Just getting up and saying no and making sure that the people who are supporting me understand how hard it is. And I also have two children, and I'm trying to make sure that they are going to follow healthy eating lifestyle. \n\n ###",

Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : I think sweet potatoes. You know, usually, we - one of the staples of a holiday meal like Thanksgiving might include candied sweet potatoes. But instead of using the loaded up sugar, why not try doing some mashed sweet potatoes with a little orange juice, a sprinkle of brown sugar. You could add skim milk if you want that, and reduced trans fat-free margarine. Or you could even bake a casserole, tossing cubes of potatoes in with Granny Smith apples and raisins and unsweetened apple juice for flavor, you know?

But I'm back in my heels and the main thing is my self-esteem is gradually - it's getting much better because I've gotten to a point it's - and it was a horrible habit that I'm still having a problem with when I was overweight - extremely overweight - I didn't even weigh myself. I didn't even look in the mirror at myself. So those are some things that I'm still struggling with, and I'd still see myself as a fat person.

But for Pete Hamill, the son of Irish immigrants, there was something visceral that drew him to Robert Kennedy. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Trying to define a friendship is always difficult, but I felt connected to him in a way. I think that had something to do with the kind of Irish fatalism that was in him. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Kennedy had plenty of reasons to be fatalistic: seeing his brother John shot down in Dallas, watching a war in Vietnam spin out of control, witnessing cities burn after Martin Luther King's assassination two months earlier. And on that evening, here in Los Angeles 40 years ago, there was an aura of hope mixed with the fatalism. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Robert Kennedy was running to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Pete Hamill was with the Kennedy campaign that night as they waited for the results of the critical California primary. He says it's hard for young people to understand now, but there were no cell phones, no email, just a lot of people going in and out and bringing bits of news from here and there with them. Bobby Kennedy sat in his shirtsleeves, waiting to learn his fate. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : And he had that fatalistic look still. I think he was prepared to lose, and he was prepared to win. And we were there for a while and finally on the screen came the news that he look - apparently had won the California primary. And he got up to get dressed and get a necktie, and then we all went down in a freight elevator down to the kitchen. And he went out and he did an off-the-cuff speech that was wonderfully - talking and funny, and he hoped that Don Drysdale, the pitcher from the Dodgers, was going to part of this team since he had pitched his sixth straight shutout, which is incomprehensible to the modern baseball. And he made a joke about Sam Yorty not being able to come - who was the mayor of Los Angeles and hated Kennedy. Among other things, he wouldn't provide police protection. \n\n ###",

And I was in the kitchen, suddenly, along with other reporters, Rosey Greer and George Plimpton, people like that. And he turned at one point because three Mexican chefs or assistants or busboys or something were standing on his left, my right, and he turned to shake hands with one of them - a young guy named Juan Romero (ph). And as he was turned, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang came the shots. Not loud. Not 45s. It was a small- caliber pisto, and then it was just chaos. And there was a struggle with Sirhan for the gun - his arm being lowered enough that the people behind Kennedy were shot in the legs. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Were you struggling for that gun? Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Yeah. I was one of the guys - I didn't have that - my hand on the gun, but I threw a good punch over the shoulder of somebody. And then the reporter instinct took over again, and I was just watching every detail. Looking at everything. Look at the reaction, writing the sounds. And I knew somehow that I'd never talk to him again. He had this smile that was almost accepting, as if to say, OK, this is it. That it had been there all along - again, that fatalism. Don't count on November, you might not get through June. And they took him away. And we all went out to the hospital. My brother Brian (ph) had a car and was driving us and we waited all night; he was still alive. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : We kept getting bulletins about being alive, and he lived for 24 hours and died, again in the early hours. And it was appalling for it to have happened again. It was something that I - maybe some of us including me, might have said, gee, what if this happens again? But we didn't count on it, it didn't seem possible, although the killing of Martin Luther King made you worry about it all the time. And then here it was. And we left around just before dawn. My brother Brian, who's a photographer, and somebody else. We dropped someone off. Off we went. I was living in Laguna Beach, and we drove all the way home. I had two young daughters, 5 and 3.

Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Or read it. Forgive me. But that was the feeling, and I think a lot of people had it. A lot of people I knew stopped investing any kind of hope in politics. There were a lot of discussions later - what if this hadn't happened, what if he had been president instead of Nixon.

He was a great \"perhaps\" as far as our politics was concerned. And yet the voice for some of us echoes across those decades, and we still worry about the people who run and about our country.

It's the second-largest city in Iraq, and ISIS has controlled it for the past two years. The fact that a terrorist group like ISIS was ever allowed to get a foothold in that country is a blow to the tens of thousands of U.S. troops and military personnel who tried to bring stability to Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : David Kilcullen is one of them. He was a senior counterterrorism adviser to then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and General David Petraeus when he was overseeing that war. Kilcullen argues in his book, \"Blood Year,\" that the U.S. had a window of opportunity to make its counterinsurgency in Iraq work. But that window, he says, is now closed. DAVID KILCULLEN : Counterinsurgency itself isn't actually a strategy. It's just a set of techniques. And it has to be embedded within a broader political or military strategy. And that's where we really struggled. In Afghanistan, we went into one of the least developed, most damaged countries on the planet. We articulated an incredibly ambitious nation-building reconstruction program but then failed to put in the attention or the resources that would have been needed to meet the goals that were laid out. DAVID KILCULLEN : Having committed ourselves to this giant effort in Afghanistan, we then turned away within a year and invaded a completely different country that was, you know, not close to Afghanistan and required many of the same resources that we would have needed to do Afghanistan properly. And I think in the case of Iraq, it wasn't so much a lack of resources. It was that we didn't put the effort into coming up with a workable political strategy to bring the different elements of Iraqi society together. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So if we can boil this down, are you suggesting that we wouldn't be in the place we are in today, that ISIS wouldn't be the threat that it is today had the U.S. employed a counterinsurgency set of tactics, as you outlined them, in the way that they should've? \n\n ###",

I mean, you know, there is no doubt in my mind that there would not be an ISIS today if we had not invaded Iraq in 2003. At the same time, though, there also wouldn't be one if we hadn't left Iraq in the way that we did in 2011. And I should point out that that's not a partisan political statement. It was both the Obama and the Bush administrations that were involved in both of those decisions - well, in the decision to leave. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : But the U.S. conducted a robust counterinsurgency war in Afghanistan for at least six years, spent tens of billions of dollars on that effort. I understand you're saying if the U.S. hadn't taken its eye off Afghanistan and moved to Iraq that that situation could've turned out better. But what is the time horizon for a successful counterinsurgency campaign? How many years does it take? DAVID KILCULLEN : That's actually very well understood, how many years it takes. It takes between 10 and 15 to be successful. Counterinsurgency is not a long-term solution. What it is is like taking antibiotics so that you can buy time for that political reconciliation and transition that's needed to resolve the problem. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Barack Obama has used drone warfare more than any other American president. It's been a central piece of his military strategy against al-Qaida and ISIS. And the administration has looked at it as really a key way to keep U.S. troops out of harm's way while keeping the threat at bay. Do you think that has been effective? DAVID KILCULLEN : I think I would put drones in the same category as counterinsurgency, right? It's a technique, not a strategy. And using it instead of a strategy is not, you know, viable. That said, it's been a very effective technique in damaging senior leadership of terrorist groups, particularly in Pakistan and Yemen. It's been quite effective, as you mentioned, in keeping U.S. military forces out of the environment on the ground. Where I think it's been lacking is that we have tended to rely on it rather than focusing on addressing the - you know, the issues that make drone strikes necessary in the first place. \n\n ###",

DAVID KILCULLEN : Well, I think that's the great question, right? I mean, I - and I think there's actually a very strong degree of continuity in U.S. counterterrorism strategy going back to about the end of 2004. And it basically involves three elements. One is to break up and to destroy the leadership of current terrorist groups. The second one is to prevent the emergence of new terrorist groups to take their place. And then the third is to work with partners to remedy the conditions that give rise to those terrorist groups in the first place. DAVID KILCULLEN : We've done extraordinarily well on the first element. We've done pretty poorly on the second two. And what I recommend we do is we start with defeating the Islamic State. DAVID KILCULLEN : To do that, I think you have to recognize that the Islamic State is not - it's really not one thing. It's three things. It's a state-like entity. It's a series of guerrilla movements across about 20 countries. And then it's this sort of largely online network of supporters. Each of those requires quite a different set of approaches.

So one of the things that we see online is the different attempts that are made. So they landed on ombre, O-M-B-R-E, which is the French word for shadow. It's also the name for, I think, a card game or something in English, which is why it's there. And also umber with a U, which is, of course, the color. And so they landed on these different pages kind of searching for the correct word, which reminds me of Aleppo. There's a combining form, lepo-, L-E-P-O, which people landed on because Aleppo is the name of a city, which is also in the dictionary, but people didn't know how to spell it.

We're looking for some - it could be the etymology, the word history of debate. It could be a simple question - does a debate need to be between two people, or is a moderator always a neutral party? You know, that kind of thing. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : In other words, there are kind of encyclopedic questions that can be answered in the dictionary as well. And I don't register a sort of signal of ignorance when we see the curiosity of the public. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you're saying that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone doesn't understand what the word debate means, but they're searching for some kind of greater contextual understanding of the word.

We also get some oil from Algeria, and Libya has deposits as well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You mentioned Sudan. China has not been shy about going to them for oil, have they? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Not at all. As a matter of fact, China imports about 40 to 50 percent of its oil from Sudan right now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now you talk about something that you termed the resource curse. What's that? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, the resource curse has to do with the boom of some discovery of mineral deposits such as oil and natural gas. And what's happened in the past is that countries that have such a boom tend to neglect other sectors of their economy such as agriculture. And in Africa, that's critical because in Africa, the population growth outstrips agricultural production, and there's always a need for importing food. So the curse has to do with that neglect of other sectors of the economy. \n\n ###",

Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Absolutely, they won't. Oftentimes what happens is if there's a certain amount of corruption - official and unofficial - some political officials tend to scrape off the profits from this oil in sort of a rent-seeking kind of behavior. And, of course, they don't tax their citizens very heavily, so the citizens don't have leverage against the government to make them behave more responsibly. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, who then gets the money? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, the money goes to corrupt politicians and in places like the Niger Delta right now. There's a great deal of political-slash-criminal activity related to the oil production in the Niger Delta. There are groups that claim to be fighting for self-determination, but at the same time, what they do is tap into these oil pipelines, skim off oil and - you know, last year they earned about $1.5 billion in this way, and they take this money and they pump it into the acquisition of more and more weapons, fast boats that operate on the high seas, and in that way they are able to kidnap oil workers and people involved in that industry, but offshore.

It's about power, but it's also about economics and sort of a economic aggrandizement, and particularly in those enclave economies such as oil, such as coltan, such as diamonds, and even gold. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I want to move on to another topic. Last week, the International Criminal Court announced that Thomas Lubanga will stand trial in March. Now, he's a former militia leader in the Democratic Republic of Congo who allegedly recruited and trained thousands of child soldiers. This is going to be the International Court's first ever war crimes trial. Lubanga has denied all the charges. How significant is this prosecution? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : It's very significant because once we get this - this court has been talked about for years and years and years, and was finally approved and created in 2002. There are a number of conflicts that have taken place in Africa which involve or have been termed crimes against humanity. We do have the International Criminal Court in the Hague right now where - not Charles Taylor - Slobodan Milosevic was tried, but this particular court is going to be directed more at these crimes against humanity throughout the world. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, specifically, what is Lubanga accused of? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, he's accused of a lot of things. One, as you mentioned, recruiting child soldiers; that is soldiers for his militia who were under 15. He's been accused of massacres. Five - fifty thousand people had been killed in the past four years as the consequence of the activities of his movement, and there was one incident where - there was a massacre of 400 people: Some of the victims were murdered with sledgehammers, others were taken into captivity as child soldiers, but also as sex slaves, and he's done a lot of damage. \n\n ###",

Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : I just want to address one other thing about that Lubanga. The resource there in Eastern Congo is gold and that's driven a lot of what people see as ethnic conflict, you know, his ethnic group against others. Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, how effective do I think this ICC will be. I think it will be effective at least in, you know, in that it will have a demonstration effect. There'll be countries which will still not be able to - or criminals who will not be able to be tried. Sudan, for example, the two individuals who have been indicted as well: One is a minister, a government minister and the other is a militia leader of the Janjaweed, but Sudan won't turn over either of these. The fact is, DRC is cooperating with the court, and, therefore, Lubanga has been turned over. And I'm pretty sure they'll beat the troughs of the LRA's individuals as well.

That would be with us forever. Ms. CHAKA KHAN (Singer) : (Singing) Oh, sweet thing. Ms. JOAN ARMATRADING (Artist) : (Singing) Oh the feeling when you're reeling. You step lightly thinking you're number one. Down to zero with a word. Leaving for another one. Now you walk with your feet back on the ground down to the ground, down to the ground. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There are also people who were format breakers like Joan Armatrading. And she said it is something about the songs that demand that the lyrics be as poetic as the notes you strum together. Talk about what you got from the interview with her. \n\n ###",

I was really taken aback by the work that she puts into meshing or fusing the music with the lyrics - and the way that she was able to speak so eloquently about it. Well, just the fact that, you know, she's in her mid-50s, but she's still very open and still embracing lots of different ideas and fusing them at her music. It was very inspiring because she still opens her mind. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Was there any difference you found between the people who might be 60s and above and the people who might be 40s and below? Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Well, the major thing that I noticed is that in the diamond group, that's the older group, they're very, very concerned with the state of black music today and they spoke about that at me. But some of that I kept in the book and other pieces I kept out. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : But with the younger artists, they talked about the fact that there was a shift in the music that nowadays, for example, you'd be hard pressed to find whole families listening to the same music. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Brenda Russell spoke about this and Dianne Reeves. And they remembered fondly, you know, the time when they were growing up how moms and fathers and grandmothers and cousins - everybody was enjoying the same music and how - that's sadly missing. They see a lot of that in today's culture. So that was one thing that really struck home with me. \n\n ###",

He's an assistant professor of business and public policy at The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Wolfers, welcome. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Pleasure to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So there have been a bunch of new articles analyzing research on the death penalty, arguing that there is a deterrent effect. How do you process the debate at this stage over whether the death penalty is a deterrent? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : I think the debate, so far, has been actually quite conclusive, but conclusive about proving that the empirical evidence here is very inconclusive. The truth is, after poring over the data, it's just plain very hard to know. And, Farai, let me give you an intuition for that. You know, I'm - I do a lot of statistics and econometrics, and normally, I would - I like to tell people that statistics can help solve many of our problems. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : This is a case where, if you think about, say, a state like California, the number of homicides that occurs in California in any given year - it could be two and half thousand one year, one and a half thousand the next, 3,000 the year after, so it's not only a very, very high number, but it goes up and down a whole heck of a lot - then if you can think about the number of executions that occurs in California, it'll be one execution one year, three the next, zero the next, and if one were looking to see, say, as many as the proponents claim that each execution deterrs, say, four homicides, then they're looking to explain a very, very small proportion of the ups and down in the homicide data. And so trying to sort out which of the ups and downs are due to prison policy, which are due to police, which are due to variation in executions just turned out to be an incredibly difficult task. \n\n ###",

Are you saying that that's just a statistical anomaly? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Yes. It's no coincidence that their work was published in the Wall Street Journal which has a very political editorial board. So just to clarify for your listeners, they looked at the aggregate number of homicides in the U.S. year-to-year, and they found that it went up when the number of executions went down. If you looked at an earlier sample the previous 50 years, you, in fact, find the opposite. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Or an alternative, you could take the same approach and look at what happened to the homicide rate in states that actually had zero executions and it turns out, in states that don't have the death penalty, the murder rate over the last 40 years has pretty much moved in walk step as with states that do have the death penalty, suggesting that the difference between the two, there isn't much of a difference between the two and, therefore, not much that the death penalty can explain. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So when you think about these professors publishing an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, and you mentioned that they are highly politicized. They're considered by many to be a very, very highly politicized conservative op-ed page, what does that do to the court of public opinion? How much do things like op-eds and academic studies have to do with how people actually legislate and how courts actually make decisions? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : The public certainly look to academics to try and sort out some of these questions, like does the death penalty deter. The only people who have the - or the people who have the largest appetite to try to answer the public on that, unfortunately, are those with ideological opinions which, often, they'll dress up as science. \n\n ###",

He said he was for it because he believed in deterrence, but he actually made an even stronger statement, which is he said he thought that was the only reason to be for it. If that's the case, then there really should be greater scientific effort in trying to understand what really is going on with respect to deterrence. Unfortunately, of course, at the moment, I think the scientists are a little too infected with ideology. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about the debate over methods of execution like lethal injection, which is currently being examined as to whether or not it is cruel or whether it's efficient? What's the status of that debate in your mind, and how much does that influence the general debate over executions? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : I think there's essentially two debates there. One is a legal debate - and this is the debate, literally, the Supreme Court's having, which is: Is the method of - is lethal injection cruel and unusual punishment, which is prohibited by the Constitution? There I'd simply defer to the doctors, you know, this is not a domain that you would want economists or statisticians wandering in. There is a second question which is : Would different methods be better or worse at deterring criminals? And, again, here, the evidence is not very useful, but I think its, at the very least(ph), introspection would suggest, if there were such a thing as a deterrent effect and therefore if one were on the pro-death penalty side, presumably, we would then want the method of execution to, not only be painful, but public because that would maximize, I would guess, the deterrent effect. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You're talking beheadings-in-the-courtyard type of executions. \n\n ###",

Yeah. Again, it's very hard for the evidence to speak one way or the other on that, and I think there's nothing particularly credible that can be said one way or the other. There's an interesting legal issue here as well with the two in effect. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : In the 1977 decision examining whether - by the Supreme Court reinstating the death penalty - or it might have been the '72 decision suspending the death penalty - the question of whether execution was cruel and unusual punishment came up, and at least one of the justices was of the view that if executing a criminal did not have a deterrent effect, then that would necessarily makes it cruel and unusual, and so that's a way in which the deterrence debate can speak to some of those questions that are arising.

She reveals in the interview that this was, you know, one of her deepest passions. And I wanted to talk to her about her work, the foundation, and the sort of issue that she was aiming to address with it. And the interview request was put in six months prior to November 8th. So this was, you know, a long time, you know, coming, you know, waiting for the interview, and I'm happy that I did get speak to her, though. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And that foundation deals with the issue of education and dropout prevention, sometimes using music to try to encourage kids to stay engaged. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Definitely. Their first initiative and program was Loop Dreams, which Kanye and his mom, Dr. West, were going - that was to be the first initiative. And that was basically to educate children about the music business, behind the scenes, about music production, to really inspire them to get motivated and to address issues within education as well.

And she just seemed to have such a warm and caring spirit. She was graceful. She was kind. She was wise. She was highly intelligent and she was focused and deeply passionate. So she just struck me as, you know, just a great, awesome, mother-figure. And, you know, she even reminded me of my own mother who passed away this year in February.

Let's take a listen. Dr. DONDA WEST (Professor, Chicago State University; Mother of Kanye West) : So when you look at all of the obstacles that there are in raising kids, you can sort of see why it's really, really important to try to keep their minds straightened out, but at the same time being sensible enough so they can be creative and come into their own. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What kind of an impression did you get of how she brought that spirit to raising her son, who is, of course, at this point not only incredibly creative, but incredibly wealthy at being creative? SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Of course. And, you know, she addresses those points. She really - I think with Kanye, she really did want to just inspire him and keep him motivated. And she really goes into a lot more detail about that in the interview in the January 2008 issue of Sister 2 Sister. She's asked to what was some of her proudest and most disappointing moments with Kanye, what things does she wish that she could have done differently in raising him. And so she really addresses all of that. But, like that quote - like the audio that you just played, she really did want to, you know, let him be free, let him speak his mind, let him be creative and driving human being. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, this whole question of the death and whether it's related to the plastic surgery has brought Donda West's name to the lips of many people who may not even know that much about her famous son.

She was looking at education for about 31 years, you know, chairwoman of the English department. And she - I think with the - I think the great thing, if anything, that comes out of this is that people will now know about Dr. West, the humanitarian, the activist, the leader. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : I think that in her passing, we lost a leader. And we don't have many leaders nowadays, whether that would be in the black community or, you know, whether that would be just in mainstream society. You know, we question our government.

That's an epicenter of the protests. When we reached her on Friday, she was at a police station, helping students who'd been arrested. FASIHA HASSAN : We had three students who were arrested for singing struggle songs. You know, students in South Africa sing songs that our mothers and fathers sort of sang during the anti-apartheid movement. So those three students were singing these songs. They were arrested for singing. There are students who are being arrested for public violence, incitement of violence, illegal gathering. There is, in fact, one charge, at least, of malicious damage to property. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : What exactly is your movement fighting for? FASIHA HASSAN : The biggest call is for free, quality and decolonized education. There have been huge issues of access to education, particularly higher education.

So government funding is there, but it is not sufficient. And I think I must give some context here to say the basic education system in South Africa, particularly the public one, is of a very low quality. So students who come from a poor, disadvantaged background are not getting enough of a quality education on a sort of high school level or primary school level and thus are not able to gain access into university. FASIHA HASSAN : Now, let's say someone does even gain access into a university - which, by the way, is an exception. Now, say they do. They're in the city for the very first time. Accommodation is unlikely to be covered, so that student is likely to sleep in the library, in a computer lab. They don't have money every month, so we've had to start a feeding scheme. And that student ends up failing academically, not because they don't work hard - by virtue of how this system is structured, that they aren't able to get the support they require and thus they aren't able to perform academically. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I'm looking at a picture of classes being disrupted at the University of - I mean, the current situation means that a lot of universities are closed. Classes are not happening. Nobody's getting an education. How is that in anybody's interest? FASIHA HASSAN : We all want to go back to the academic program. But we must understand the urgency and the need for this free and quality education. And I think perhaps I haven't made myself clear in saying that there are hundreds of thousands of students who have their livelihoods on the line by virtue of the fact that they've been born poor and the fact that they've been born black because the system is also structurally racist. And we still (unintelligible) inherited this system from apartheid. We inherited this system from colonial powers. It was never designed to educate the masses of this country.

And we head north now to Maine, a state where the outcome is not really in doubt. Unless the polls are dead wrong, Hillary Clinton is expected to carry Maine, which raises the question - what was Donald Trump doing there yesterday? We've got Steve Mistler on the line to help answer that question. He's the chief political reporter for Maine Public Radio. Good morning, Steve. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : We are glad to have you on our air. So Trump held a rally yesterday in Bangor, in a state that polls indicate leans blue, as we said. Why is that a good use of his time? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Well, some models of Trump's path to the White House include him winning Maine's 2nd Congressional District. And that means it could get - it could have an outsized role in the election if Trump actually carries some of the bigger swing states. It's the largest district east of the Mississippi, and it's historically been purple. Voters have sent Democrats and Republicans to Congress. But the district has also undergone some changes that have made it shade red in the last several years. There's been paper mills that have closed and manufacturing jobs have left. It's older, whiter, rural and fewer people with college degrees than the more liberal 1st District. So if the prevailing analysis of Trump voters is correct, it's really in his sweet spot. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : We should give people a little Maine politics tutorial here, I guess. Maine has four electoral votes and three of the four are generally considered safe for Democrats. But that fourth, that 2nd District vote that you're talking about, that's the one that maybe is looking like a toss-up now. \n\n ###",

And he has been outspoken all through this campaign season in his support of Trump. Does he remain so? And how much weight does his voice carry? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : He does remain an ardent supporter of Trump. And his voice does carry a lot of weight in the 2nd District, which he has carried twice in his first two elections here. And in fact, Trump parroted many of the things that the governor talks about quite frequently, which is welfare, the loss of manufacturing jobs and the heroin crisis.

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Twenty years ago, Chicago lost one of the city's most beloved mayors, Harold Washington. In 1983, Washington became the first African-American to run the windy city. Washington brought a wave of changes to the city. Under his motto fairer than fair, he increased minority business contracts and opened the Chicago budget process to public input. He was reelected in 1987 but never finished his second term that's because Washington died from a massive heart attack at the age of 65. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : The city of Chicago is celebrating Washington's legacy. Here to talk more about the late mayor is Washington's former deputy press secretary, Laura Washington, no relation. Today, Laura is a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a professor at DePaul University. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome.

So his win was considered an upset. What was the political and racial climate like in Chicago when he ran for mayor in 1983? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : Well, the city has always been very segregated, you know, Farai, and it remains that way today. The Democratic Party establishment, the machine that was established by Richard J. Daley, was in full swing and, basically, was a party of exclusion.  Most of the folks that ran the city, most of the mayors that ran the city had been pretty much taking care of business for the white community, and African-Americans and Latinos, in particular, felt really left out of the system. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : So when Harold Washington came along, this was actually his second run at the mayor's race. He, I think, responded and struck a chord in these communities to people who sort of like it's our turn. It's our time to get an opportunity to sit in city hall. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I understand he didn't get a lot of press. First of all, explain why. And, secondly, if that was the case, what did he use to win? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : The media was pretty much tied in to the same old, the way city hall had been running again the Democratic Party establishment. They didn't - most folks - and they covered politics then and even today - are white and didn't have a lot or little bit handle on what was going on in communities of color. So they didn't see Harold Washington coming. He had run before. He was a well established, very popular black congressman on the south side of Chicago. They didn't really know him very well. \n\n ###",

One was Mayor Daley's son, Richard, and who's the current mayor - and who is not the current mayor - and Jane Byrne, who was the mayor at the time. And they were really focused on them. It was a three-way race, and Harold Washington snuck up right behind them and came in to win. I think the way he did it was by igniting a movement. There was a lot of unhappiness with the way government had been run, the exclusionary practices of Jane Byrne. So he tapped into that. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : I remember sitting down - I covered the mayor in his candidacy before I went to work for him. I remember sitting down with his campaign manager, Al Rabie(ph) and asking, you know, your organization is pretty much nonexistent. You don't have the money. You don't have the staff. You don't have the organization. How do you expect to win? And what Rabie said me is, we're not running a campaign, we're running a movement.

When Harold Washington came in, he brought people in but some other people must have had to go. What did that do to the city? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : It tore the city, and particularly city hall, apart. He declared, the day he was inaugurated, he declared war on the Democratic Party machine. He said, you know, days - work for a day's pay. We're going to bring in new people. We're going to open up the government to the entire city and that was the declaration of war to the machine. So the folks and the machine really dug their heels in and made sure that he couldn't get anything passed. He brought in a lot of new people, but they were mainly through what they call Shakman-exempt positions or political appointments that he had control over. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : He couldn't do much about the folks who were there and, of course, the folks who were in the government were sabotaging him left and right, but he was able to - by executive order. He couldn't get anything passed to the city council because he didn't have the majority. The white majority fought him tooth and nail. But he was able to get a lot done through executive orders. And actually, in many ways, just by going directly to some of the white aldermen's constituents, the folks that were not voting on the policies and practices that were going to be good for their community, made sure he got the word out through the media and just on his own to tell them, look, you should talk to your representatives. They're not representing you well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, he died from a massive heart attack while sitting at his desk in city hall. He never got to serve out his second term. Some people think there was foul play behind his death. What do you think about that? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : Yeah, that's why those old rumors that just won't die even after 20 years. The reason for that is that he, you know, the man was larger than life. He had so much energy. He worked 14 hours a day. He was always on the street. And that morning, the morning he died, he had been out at a groundbreaking, he'd been his usual jolly self. He went back to his office, was sitting and talking to his press secretary and he fell over on the desk. By the time they got him to the hospital, he probably was already dead. \n\n ###",

That's following an extraordinary week in which women, a growing number of them, stepped forward and accused Trump of groping and kissing them without their consent. A key question is whether Trump's decline now puts some predictably red states within reach of Hillary Clinton. Today marks 23 days and counting until the election, and we are marking it by checking in with different corners of the country where the campaign is playing out in unexpected ways. We begin this hour in Georgia. That's where Jim Galloway covers politics for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Jim Galloway, good morning. JIM GALLOWAY : Good morning. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You had a column that had this headline - \"A Donald Trump Implosion Could Put Georgia Back In Play.\" So let me start with you there. Is Georgia back in play? JIM GALLOWAY : Well, we don't know yet. We haven't seen the hardcore evidence, which is increased TV advertising, visits from, at least if not the candidates themselves, some principle surrogates. That hasn't happened. But you've seen little things happen. You've seen - you've seen - we've got Evan McMullin, the Never Trump fellow, coming through here on Monday. It's - I will tell you what - this Donald Trump video is making an impact, but it's happening slowly.

I mean - I mean, Georgia has such a - it's such a high population when it comes to to evangelical Christians. This really is roiling - it's splitting them quite a - right in half. And the impact of that - we just haven't been able to measure that. I would - I would guess that we're going to - the newspaper will be doing some polling within the next week to 10 days, and I think that's when we'll really get a firm handle on what's going to happen. A previous poll earlier last - late last week had Donald Trump still at 48 percent, Clinton at 42. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : So narrowing. I mean, you mentioned polling, and I know that NPR's latest battleground map had Georgia at the start of the month - at the start of October - leaning Republican. And we just moved it into the tossup category. JIM GALLOWAY : It is - look, it's entirely possible. The last time the state went blue was in 1992 for Bill Clinton. And what happened was that Ross Perot just gobbled up 12 percent of the vote, mostly Republican. And the final tally was Bill Clinton 43 percent, George H.W. Bush maybe a half percentage point below him. So it was very tight. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I mean, we should remind people of the political landscape in Georgia. The governor, both senators, all Republicans. I know Democrats struggled even to find somebody to run against the incumbent, Senator Johnny Isakson, earlier this year. If the - just in a sentence or two, if I had called you six months ago and told you Georgia would be a tossup three weeks before Election Day, would you have believed me? JIM GALLOWAY : Oh, of course not, no, no, no, no. And I will tell you what - there's a kind of a halfway mark between the status quo and and Hillary Clinton taking the state of Georgia. And that is if Donald Trump plunges enough, then he does hurt Republican incumbent Johnny Isakson in the U.S. Senate race. You know, we have - we have a - we require our candidates to earn 50 percent-plus-one. And we've got a three-way race in the U.S. Senate race. If Isakson dips below 50 percent, then that's a nine-week runoff. That could be the real impact. \n\n ###",

Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : He was an ordinary guy. He was a young African-American meat cutter from Washington D.C. who was drafted into the army in 1942. Shipped off to the Indo-Burmese border region to work on the Ledo Road, which was a military highway that was being built from north-east India across northern Burma, and then linking up the old Burma road and China, to keep Nationalist China supplied during the war. \n\n ###",

You write about the circumstances of this place - just brutal. Leeches, disease, terrible heat, humidity, rain, mud and the headhunters. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : And the headhunters. These were the Naga. This is an ethnic group, a multi-tribal ethnic group that lives up and down the Indo-Burmese border in the hills there. And this was a tribe renowned and feared for its practice of headhunting. It really was the linchpin of society at the time. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So these people are all over the hills. Also tigers, snakes, a lot of dangerous things. But maybe the worst part of daily life for the soldiers like Herman Perry - this is an all-black kind of construction brigade that he's in - are these racist white officers. I mean they have a very difficult time there. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah. This is a segregated army during World War II, you have to keep in mind. Many, many black soldiers were consigned to labor battalions because the War Department really bought into the racial science of the day, thinking that black soldiers weren't necessarily fit for combat. So most black soldiers were consigned to these kind of menial, manual labor chores and often to the worst assignments, the Ledo Road being one of them. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, Herman Perry snaps after months and months and months working on this road, very bad conditions. He's being maybe harassed or maybe disciplined, by a white lieutenant. And Herman Perry shoots him, kills him and runs for the forest. \n\n ###",

The other factor in this is that he'd also been coming off an all-night opium vendor, and that's why he'd missed the call of reveille in the morning. And so he'd been placed under arrest, actually. And he'd been to the stockade once before and had a very horrific experience there. They use very extreme punishments on the inmates in the stockade in India. So when he learned that he's was going to be under arrest once more and heading back to the stockade, he just absolutely snapped, and ends up shooting this white lieutenant who was unarmed, I should add, to death, on Ledo Road. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So he goes into the forest. He's just got the clothes that he's wearing, nothing else. And what happens? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Well, first he actually wanders back into camp. After three days he kind of goes through a dissociative episode and kind of forgets what happens. He goes back to camp as if nothing had happened. And he learns, much to his horror, that he had killed this white lieutenant, and there was this 1000 rupee price on his head. He has a rifle with him, and his friends give him a few tins of food. And he starts running. But he realizes pretty early on during his flight that he has to find a place to settle down permanently, or he'll never make it in the jungle. And one day he's walking along a stream up on the Pa-kai(ph) mountains and he sees the glimpse of this peaked longhouse with palm fronds and he starts walking towards it. And this is the village where he kind of reinvents himself as a member of the Naga tribe. ALEX CHADWICK, host : How is it that this black American GI, on the run, and really being pursued by the army, how is he able to ingratiate himself with a tribe of headhunters living in this remote village in the mountains of Burma? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : On the most basic level, bribery. He actually enlisted the aid of some fellow, sympathetic soldiers, African-American soldiers, who stole rations for him, especially a tin fruit cocktail. And the Nagas love this, not just for the food, but also for the tin. They didn't really have lightweight metals. He also had an M-1 rifle. The Nagas just had spears and swords, and so the rifle came in very handy for hunting. \n\n ###",

I interviewed his sister. And the thing that came up again and again about Herman is just he's a very, very charming man. He really had the gift of gab. And he picked up some of the tribal language while working on the roads. He really used that to his advantage, in becoming a member of this tribe. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And Herman stays on in this village, he meets the daughter of the - I guess of the village or clan chief. And they fall in love and he marries her. They have a child - I mean, I'm thinking - no, Brendan's got to be making this up, right? I mean what a story! Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah, it's such a story. And there are many times in researching it I thought I'm going to hit a brick wall here, it can't really get any more incredible. And if it does become more incredible, there's no way I can verify that these things actually happened.

And a lot of that is actually just in official army documentation from his court-martial. ALEX CHADWICK, host : He was court-martialed. This manhunt, the great manhunt did succeed at last. He was caught, he was tried, he was sentenced to death for the murder of this lieutenant. And then - he manages to escape. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah, he escapes from Death Row in India. He actually lucked out in that the appeals process was held up by a variety of kind-of quirks of fortune. So it took a few months for his death sentence to be approved by the military brass. And during that time he was able to plot his escape. \n\n ###",

Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : There are many people involved in the drama who are still alive. I managed to track down the prosecutor involved in the court-martial. A military policeman who actually shot Perry during one of these phases of the manhunt. And at the time, this was a really big story out there in Indian Burma. There actually is a lot of documentation of what occurred. It just took a lot of elbow grease to find it. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You couldn't interview Herman Perry. The accounts of what he did and why he did it, they're drawn from documents and accounts from that time. Were you ever able to figure it out, what did happen with him? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : I really think that the story's both more complex and more simple than I think a lot of people would assume. On a very basic level, he was a jungle freak-out. There were a lot of them. He experienced what would be now be called PTSD. He was traumatized, he was a psychiatric casualty. And that led to the tragic circumstances that ended in Lieutenant Harold Katy's(ph) murder. So I think that's part of it. But also you have to realize that he became a folk hero to a lot of people along the road, especially African-American soldiers.

This week - the financially invisible, meaning people who don't have a credit card or checking or savings account or a credit score, people who are invisible to banks and credit institutions, which can make it hard to get loans for things like a house or a car or a business. Jose Quinonez found a solution to that problem. He is the founder and CEO of the Mission Asset Fund, and he just won a MacArthur Fellowship for his program helping people become financially visible. He joins us now in our studios here in Washington. Thanks so much for coming in. JOSE QUINONEZ : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right, how does this work? You came up with this idea and you called it lending circles. What are these, and how does it help people become financially visible? JOSE QUINONEZ : Right, so in immigrant communities, there's a rich tradition of people coming together to lend and save money. This is an activity that is pretty widespread and it's a pretty global phenomena and has been happening for a millennia. What we did was basically recognize that activity as bonafide financial activity that just needed to be formalized. And the way we did that was we asked people to sign promissory notes so that they can then participate in the program, and then we then report that activity to the credit bureau. So that's how we're helping people build and establish their credit scores by reporting on this activity that's already taking place in the community. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK, so let's back up. So this is an idea where people in an extended family or neighborhood, a community, get together, actually pool their money. \n\n ###",

You may have 10 people, and informally it could be your neighbors, could be your, you know, relatives, could be your co-workers. And then they'll all agree to, say, put in a hundred dollars into the pot, so you then collect that thousand dollars. And then they agree on who takes that thousand dollars first, and they do that in rotation until everybody has a chance in getting that thousand dollars. Again, this activity has been going on for millenia. What we did differently was we asked them, OK, well, by signing a promissory note, we basically transformed it from being invisible to being invisible. We transformed it from being informal to being formal so that the financial systems of today can actually recognize that activity. And so we put ourselves in the middle of that transaction, and then we become the loan servicer and then also become the data furnisher to the credit bureaus.

I mean, some places you need a credit report to even get a job. And so without that credit report, it's extremely difficult to actually become a full participant in our economy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The lending circles that you create, are these all circles of people who have to be in the same geographic area or could you connect an individual in San Francisco with another individual in Washington, D.C.? JOSE QUINONEZ : Yeah, well, theoretically we can, and I think in the future we'll do that, but right now we're keeping it very local, you know, because we want that human interaction to happen 'cause that's actually is a very important element to the program.

Is it a hundred dollars or $50, $75, $200? And then they'll start to decide who goes first, who goes second, and sometimes they do that by drawing numbers from a hat. And then they negotiate and it's like, oh, I actually need number four because April I need that money for this or I actually want the last number so that I can, you know, save it for a down payment or something. So there's, like, a community conversation about money and they're talking about their goals and aspirations for what they're going to do with this. And then that solidifies it. That gets people more committed. You know, they see each other eye to eye, right, and I think that's one of the elements of our success is, like, we create this human connection across people.

We all know there's a gender gap when it comes to pay in this country. That disparity is even worse for the 10 million Latinas in the American workforce. The average woman working full-time earns 80 cents on the dollar paid to men. Latinas earn just 54 cents on the dollar. And that wage gap persists even as the number of Latino-owned businesses is growing and as more and more get college degrees. The question is why. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : And to help answer it, we've called on Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women and Families. Hi, Vicki. VICKI SHABO : Hi, Mary Louise. It's great to be with you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : We're glad to have you with us. So 54 cents on the dollar - that's a huge gap. What explains it? VICKI SHABO : It is a huge gap. So if the wage gap were eliminated, on average, a Latina who is working full time year-round would have enough money for approximately 193 more weeks of food for herself and her family - that's more than three and a half years' worth - 27 additional months of rent. This is real bread and butter and - you know, the middle class aspect. This is preventing people from rising from one economic status to the next. And we need to unpack what this is about. I mean, this is about differences in jobs that people are holding, different education levels, different places that you might live in the country. And it is about implicit and explicit bias as well. And for Latinas, it is both a double-bind of gender and ethnicity as well. \n\n ###",

VICKI SHABO : Well, I mean, I think, you know, for each person's experience, it's a bit unique. But certainly stories of bias on the job, not being willing to ask for the raises that you might deserve, certainly not knowing what your co-workers are being paid, so not even knowing to ask and being afraid to - afraid to ask a supervisor for a raise or to remedy an inequity that might exist. So if you think about the compounding of access to quality jobs and lack of access to the supports that allow you to make ends meet, to be there for your family and to sort of rise and advance in your job and your career trajectory, these are all multiple problems that are being layered on top of one another. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : One of the factors here is education. That's presumably across the board, whether you're talking Latino or not. Unpack specifically how it plays out for Latino workers. VICKI SHABO : Education, for sure, is a factor in pay that you earn and job opportunities going forward. So if we can increase college graduation rates, that will increase pay over time. But we know, for example, that women who have college degrees are paid less than men with associate's degrees on average.

Late Friday, a 2005 tape surfaced of Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, talking about women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms. Republican leaders started breaking away from him in droves, plunging his party into chaos with only 30 days left before the election. And did we mention there's a presidential debate tonight? NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is on the line now to talk through it all. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Where does the GOP stand on Trump this morning? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Right now, more than two dozen elected Republicans are calling on Trump to step aside, including two Senate candidates from battleground states, Darryl Glenn from Colorado and Joe Heck of Nevada. There are Republicans who are saying they will no longer vote for him, but most Republicans are condemning his remarks without unendorsing Trump. And House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been twisting himself into knots about Trump for months, said he was sickened by the audiotape, but he has not withdrawn his support. And at a Ryan rally in Wisconsin yesterday where Trump was supposed to attend but didn't come, Ryan got heckled by Trump supporters. And in another sign of how deep the split is inside the GOP, there's a new poll out today by Morning Consult - it's been taken since the audiotape came out. Three-quarters of Republican voters think the party should continue to stand by Trump. \n\n ###",

Why? I mean, we've heard Donald Trump make incendiary remarks for months. We've heard him disparage women before. How is this different? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : That's a really good question. This is different in degree but not in kind. It's cruder and lewder, but there have been so many other offensive, denigrating comments that he's made. This does seem to be a tipping point. It crossed so many lines. He's bragging about sexual assault, about grabbing women's genitals, about how when you're a star, he says, you can do anything with women - talk about a rigged system. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : But ironically, this tape, which might be the undoing of Donald Trump, came in a conversation with a relative of Jeb Bush's. You know, Billy Bush, who's the host of \"Access Hollywood,\" who's on that tape with Trump, is a cousin of Jeb Bush's. So you have to wonder - why, during the primaries, the Jeb Bush oppo research people didn't just pick up the phone and called Jeb's cousin? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So if there were conversations happening about how to replace Donald Trump on the ticket - I mean, is that even possible at this point? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : It's very hard, almost impossible, according to election lawyers that NPR has talked to. The rules say you can get a candidate off the ballot in cases of death, incapacitation or declination, meaning he would voluntarily step down. And, as you said, Donald Trump has said he has no intention of dropping out. He said, the media and the establishment want him to but he will never abandon his supporters. And don't forget - voting has already begun in more than 10 states. \n\n ###",

So this story consumed a lot of attention over the past few hours. But there was a revelation on the Clinton side, too, this release of emails by WikiLeaks. What did we learn from that? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : We learned - by the way, these are hacked emails of John Podesta, her campaign chairman's email account. This came on the same day that the administration formally accused Russian security agencies of authorizing the hacking of Democratic Party officials in order to affect the U.S. elections and hurt Hillary Clinton. In these alleged excerpts of her private speeches to Wall Street banks, her paid speeches, she talks about how she's for free trade and open borders. She's sympathetic to bankers. And these tapes are - these excerpts are problematic. You can see why she didn't want them released during the primaries when she was battling Bernie Sanders. This really underscores her weaknesses with honesty and trustworthiness. It could hurt her with young people, with Sanders supporters, blue-collar Democrats. And she will certainly be asked about this tonight. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So just briefly, Mara, let's think about tonight - lots of people going to watch because the stakes are really high. What are you going to be looking for? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : This is a very tricky format. It's a town hall debate. Ordinary people, in addition to the moderators, will be asking questions. And that makes it harder for the candidates to attack each other when an ordinary voter is asking you to talk about how you will make their lives better. So I'm watching to see how both candidates navigate this format. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara. \n\n ###",

And in some places where the storm has already passed, officials say it's too dangerous for people to return to their homes. As NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports, Tybee Island off the coast of Georgia is one of those places.

Most of the 3,000 residents can't return yet. But some, like bar owner Calvin Ratterree, never left. CALVIN RATTERREE : I was going to stay no matter what, and it ended up turning into a party. (Laughter) It wasn't planned, but it happened. RAE ELLEN BICHELL, BYLINE : The night of the storm, he kept the bar open until 9 p.m., hanging out with others who ignored the mandatory evacuation order.

Good morning, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Some pretty big revelations - we just heard about Trump's tax record from 1995. How do you think he's going to play all this? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : That's a good question. He, as you just heard, he issued a statement saying that this is - he was legally required to - he paid no more tax than he was legally required to pay. But as Donald Trump might say, this is an example of a rigged system. It was legal. He has said many times that he took advantage of the laws of the country. And that interesting statement about how he knows the tax system better than anyone and only he can fix it, I think now you're going to get a lot of questions to Donald Trump about whether he plans to get rid of the loopholes that benefit wealthy investors that allowed him to do this. Is that in his tax plan or not? You already heard from the Clinton campaign. They issued statements saying this shows he's a lousy businessman. They say he lost almost a billion dollars, stiffed small businesses, laid off workers and then paid no taxes. So you're going to hear this again and again certainly in the upcoming debates. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is capping off what was a pretty tough week for Donald Trump coming off that first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. What do you know?

He's given some speeches that are really full-throated, populous speeches, talking about a corrupt system, elites, Hillary and her Wall Street donors. He even imitated her stumbling, almost collapsing at the 9/11 ceremony. He has said she's crazy. She should be in prison. He's suggested she wasn't faithful to Bill Clinton in addition to bringing up some of Bill Clinton's infidelities in the past and saying she was somehow complicit in that. So he's got... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's getting more personal. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : ...A lot - getting more personal. He's got a lot of lines of attacks out there. We'll see what he brings up in the next debates. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Let's look forward to the vice presidential debate. This is happening Tuesday. Mike Pence, Tim Kaine will go head to head. We haven't heard a whole lot from either of them so far. Do you think they're just going to echo what their running mates have been saying? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Well, they usually do. The interesting thing about this debate is these two men, Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, are stylistically so different from the top of the ticket, and they've gotten very, very little attention. Pence, in particular, is as calm and cool and collected as Donald Trump is bombastic. And usually in vice presidential debates, those candidates are stand-ins for the principles. They're not there to debate their own positions or records. But they are going to be asked - Mike Pence, at least, will be asked about everything that Donald Trump has ever said and done; same with Tim Kaine. And the other thing that's interesting this year is usually vice presidential candidates are the attack dogs. They are the ones who are willing to say things in maybe a harsher tone than the principles are willing to do. This year, that is not happening. \n\n ###",

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Yes, I think we might. But there is another wrinkle to that, which is that Trump himself has said that no one speaks for him but himself. And that means that if Mike Pence tries to sand down some of the rough edges of Trumpism, it's going to be a problem. For instance, in - with global warming, Mike Pence has said that he believes human activity does cause global warming. Well, Kellyanne Conway has said that global warming is real but not man-made but the bottom... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's the Trump campaign spokeswoman, yeah. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : That's the Trump campaign manager.

I don't have a problem with race. That's really where the problem is. ROB DANCE : I'm sending a bunch of young officers that really don't understand, a large group of them at least, some of the historical problems with race, some of the problems that we face in our community - I'm sending them out to address these problems without any knowledge. And when they go out there and then they are faced with people who, many times, dislike them and are frustrated with them because of what's happened in the last 10 years and there are a hundred encounters in the place where they live, the officers are human, too.

It's the third referendum this year by an EU member state seeking to strike down the EU's authority on refugees and other issues. Human rights advocates say the vote could empower the growing number of people who mistreat refugees in Hungary. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson joins us from outside a polling station in the capital city, Budapest. Good morning, Soraya. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE : Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Tell us what the scene is where you are. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE : I'm in Budapest's main business district, and we're in a park here across from this polling station where there's been a pretty steady turnout this morning for the second-ever referendum in this country about the EU. Basically, this referendum was called by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who spent a reported $40 million on misleading billboards, mailed leaflets and letters to voters about the impact of migrants and refugees on this country. And the polls are suggesting that an overwhelming number of those who are going to come out today and vote are going to vote no against the EU. But despite the steady turnout that we're seeing here at this particular polling station, the state is reporting that only 16 percent of eligible voters have turned out this morning. So it doesn't seem that Orban is going to be getting the 50 percent needed to make this referendum valid. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What's the motivation for calling the referendum? I mean, you say the prime minister has spent a lot of money on these ads. Is this just politically the right thing for him to do? \n\n ###",

And in fact, most of the people, the 160,000 refugees that member states had agreed to take in last year, haven't even been moved yet. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE : But the thing is Prime Minister Orban says that Hungary needs to be protected from Muslims, from terrorists, and that Brussels needs to be kept in line, that they shouldn't be bossing Hungary around. But as you mentioned, this is definitely a political ploy. And when you talk to political analysts or even opponents here, they say that this is basically an informal kickoff to the Fidesz party, and that's the party that the prime minister belongs to. You know, they're a kickoff, basically, for the campaign so that they can maintain an absolute majority in the next parliamentary elections 18 months from now. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Just briefly, Soraya, what's been happening with asylum-seekers in Hungary compared to last summer? We all remember those pictures of those hundreds of thousands of migrants pouring across that southern border. SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE : Well, since then, fences have gone up along the Serbian border, and so most of these migrants and refugees are being kept out. Those that do come in illegally are hunted down. They're prosecuted. They're violently ejected in some cases. And so they're - these migrants are stuck in horribly poor conditions at the border, unable to come in. And so it's not a really good situation for them. And in fact, there is talk about building a second fence along the Serbian border because the prime minister claims it's needed not just to keep people out but to also create, like, a holding area, if you will, for the thousands of migrants who are trying to come in. And they have prisoners in one prison actually working extra shifts to prepare razor wire for the fence while the police are recruiting 3,000 new unofficial border hunters, as they're being called. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson from Budapest, Hungary. Thanks so much, Soraya. \n\n ###",

And according to a new report, from Amnesty International, just 10 countries are hosting more than half of them. The report finds that the world's wealthiest nations are doing little to address the refugee crisis, which is the worst one since World War II. Salil Shetty is the secretary general of Amnesty International. He joins me on the line from the BBC in London. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thanks so much for being with us. SALIL SHETTY : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Which countries have taken in the most refugees in this crisis? SALIL SHETTY : The crisis has got two, sort of, broad elements to it. On the one hand, it's, of course, what we see in the Middle East right now. So Syria is really what's been in the news a great deal. But let's not forget that there are some other long-term conflicts and crises, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan. \n\n ###",

So as far as the Syrian crisis is concerned, Turkey is, by far, the largest host for Syrian refugees. But Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, all of these, host very large numbers of Syrian refugees. Eighty-six percent of the Syrian refugees, approximately, are in these neighboring countries. And then, if you look at Sudan, Somalia, then - you know, Kenya is one of the big host countries for the Somalia, Sudanese refugees. Also, if you take Afghanistan, Pakistan would be the single biggest and Iran as well. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So how do you change that? I mean, how do you incentivize wealthier countries to take in more refugees? SALIL SHETTY : One of the early calls that Amnesty International made is that, you know, this is a global crisis of proportions we've not seen since the second world war. So it needs a global response. So finally, we had a leaders meeting of the United Nations just a couple of weeks ago. But unfortunately, it was a spectacular failure. There was not a single binding, precise target which came out of that. We need groups of countries who are more willing to come forward and start taking people in. Also, like - and we've seen this. Canada, for example, has already accepted 25,000 more Syrian refugees. Germany has accepted 1 million. So it's really boiled down to a leadership choice. SALIL SHETTY : The surveys we've done with the public, you know, it completely busts this myth that the local population in these rich countries don't want to accept refugees. Like, if you take the U.S., for example, our surveys show that over 70 percent of the U.S. population do welcome refugees. In fact, 15 percent are ready to take them into their own houses. So I think it's indicative that, you know, the public is ahead of the leaders. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Although you mentioned Germany, which, in Europe, has been the country to accept the most refugees from the Syrian conflict. The chancellor there, Angela Merkel, has suffered a real political hit because of that. \n\n ###",

But, you know, you can't change things overnight. So we need long-term process of educating the population, getting them to hear the facts because what happens is that the third or so who are against refugees coming in are very vocal. And they're creating a whole atmosphere of fear, which is totally not based on the facts. SALIL SHETTY : I mean, one of the things I always tell people is that since I've spent time in these camps, I've not met a single woman, man or child who's told me, from Syria, that they would like to come to Europe. It's not a lifestyle choice, you know, to traverse the Mediterranean where thousands of people died through drownings. Or, you know - most of these European countries have signed on to the 1951 Refugee Convention, so they're simply in violation of that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : When you talk about solutions to this, you say you just need more wealthy countries to be willing to resettle refugees. And you do point to Canada as a country that has been successful in that. They've taken in more than 30,000 Syrians since 2015, compared to the U.S., which has taken in a little over 12,000 Syrian refugees. What is it about Canada's system that works? SALIL SHETTY : At the global level, the problem is we don't have a system. You know, right now, we have a completely ad hoc process where the neighboring countries simply end up carrying this burden for decades. So our proposal is that instead of 10 countries taking the load, can we share this across 60 to 90 countries on an objective basis - you know, depending on your size of your country, your population, your wealth? SALIL SHETTY : But in the case of Canada, it is really a political choice. We've been told that Canadians don't like refugees. They don't want refugees. So what happened suddenly - they suddenly changed their mind? That's not true. I mean, it was really Trudeau and, you know, their leadership. And they said that this is what Canadian values are about. And really, you know, the U.S. is another country where - it's a country that was created by people coming in from outside. I mean, if you look at what Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty is all about, it's about creating a - you know, a diverse, inclusive country, which has become so powerful because of its diversity. But, you know, in practice, the U.S. is hardly taking anybody. \n\n ###",

You finally look at what the actual money that goes across - it's close to nothing. But the main point I'd make is, humanitarian financing, very important as it is, is not a substitute for resettling people and receiving refugees.

An envelope from an anonymous source arrived on reporter Susanne Craig's desk at The New York Times last month. The return address marked Trump Tower. Inside were Donald Trump's 1995 tax returns. The New York Times revealed their findings and posted a copy of Trump's tax records on its website last night. The documents show that in 1995 Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss. Here to talk more about all this is Russ Buettner of The New York Times, one of the reporters who investigated this story. Russ, welcome to the program. RUSS BUETTNER : Thanks, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : He declared a $916 million loss. What does that mean in terms of whether or not he paid federal income taxes? RUSS BUETTNER : Well, it's essentially like a gift card from the government for almost a billion dollars. It means that the next billion dollars, $916 million, he earned over any time over the next 15 years after that or three years before that he could collect without paying any federal income taxes on it or any New York state income taxes.

There are so many other write-offs that are available to real estate people. That may be the case. So it is hard to tell. It is a snapshot in time. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You and your fellow reporters, though, spoke to tax experts before publishing this story. Was what Donald Trump did legal? RUSS BUETTNER : It was legal to the best of our knowledge. There's nothing in the returns itself that would suggest that there was anything illegal about it. It is a benefit that is available to people own - who own certain kinds of businesses in certain corporate structures. It was of a magnitude that none of them had ever seen or heard of before. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's a pretty limited picture, though. What exactly was in that envelope, and do you have any idea where it came from? RUSS BUETTNER : We don't have any idea where it came from. I don't - we don't really think it came from Trump Tower. It was just the first page of his state returns for New York, which is almost identical to what the federal tax return looks like for the state of Connecticut and the state of New Jersey.

And that was something that troubled us, that really gave us pause. Does this really mean something? And when my colleague David Barstow traveled to Florida, showed them to the tax accountant who had handled these documents, that was the first thing he recalled was that his program wouldn't allow numbers that large. And he had to take it out of his printer and type it using an old typewriter to add those digits. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There's been a lot of speculation about Donald Trump's foreign investment holdings and the extent of his charitable giving. Did you learn anything about that from these documents? RUSS BUETTNER : You - there is nothing on that. No, that would be on the supporting schedules whether he'd earned - what his, you know, income sources were. And I doubt that that would show up. It would have to show up as business revenue buried into some sort of supporting schedule. And there was not the schedule for deductions that might show charitable giving. What is noteworthy to us is that there are, as everyone knows, several optional small charitable contributions you can make to a veterans organization, a wildlife preservation fund and such things by checking a box on a tax return, and he did not check any of those boxes.

Research has shown again and again that the hits those players take can have a lasting impact on the players' brains. The NFL announced this past week that it will spend $100 million to advance concussion research. Some of that money will go into continuing efforts to develop a safer helmet. Doctors say so far, helmets have done little to reduce concussions and the long-term effects of repeated head trauma. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Joining us now to talk about this is Dr. David Camarillo. He's assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford and he leads a lab dedicated to inventing equipment that reduces traumatic brain injury in sports. Welcome to the program. DAVID CAMARILLO : Thanks, glad to be here. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So just big question right off the top - can more money help create a helmet that will prevent traumatic brain injury in football? Is it even possible? DAVID CAMARILLO : Well, I think you can certainly reduce some of the traumatic brain injuries that do occur. And it's not just the concussions. They're repetitive sub-concussive blows that some people think might be, you know, contributing to some of the long-term problems. And I think there's even a better opportunity there of reducing the severity of some of those impacts. \n\n ###",

What are players using right now, and why are they insufficient? DAVID CAMARILLO : Well, what they're using today is not significantly different than what players were using in the late '70s. The newer helmets at that point in time started incorporating foam as an energy-absorbing material whereas beforehand they had used suspension-type helmets, the same type of helmet you might use on a job construction site, like a hard hat. And the foams that are in use today have probably been tuned and optimized a little bit over the last 30, 40 years but you know, the basic concept and framework has remained the same. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There's a company in Seattle funded in part by the University of Washington, VICIS. They've got a helmet out they claim can reduce impact forces better than any other helmet on the market. That's what they say. They've also gotten funding from the NFL. What do you make of this helmet? DAVID CAMARILLO : Well, that claim very well may be true. However, I should say I haven't seen the data myself. And I certainly hope in the overall effort to advance research that they will publish and reveal more details about their helmet and the results. The thing that I like about what they're doing is they're not just simply using foams to absorb the energy. Is it possible that there might be other solutions out there that might even be better? Yeah. But I think it is a step in the right direction. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What are the other things out there that could be better? I mean, you only have so many options, right? You're still putting this thing on your head and you're trying to minimize the impact. So it doesn't just mean filling up that space in the helmet with something that's going to protect it. \n\n ###",

But the manner in which you absorb the energy, I think, matters. And this comes back to really one of the research challenges in the field, is that if you want to evaluate if a helmet's going to protect against concussion you need to understand the details of what causes a concussion. And that's something that's been missing and a tough nut to crack. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you're saying we still don't really know exactly what causes a concussion? DAVID CAMARILLO : That's exactly what I'm saying. And in fact, in this NFL funding that they've announced I think they've dedicated about $60 million towards helmets, and they lump under that same umbrella sensors. And I think their hope is that the sensors part of the research will start to uncover more details about what causes the concussion. It's more complex than you might think. And that provides a means to design and test helmets against. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What are you working on in your labs? DAVID CAMARILLO : We've found that the best approach is not so much the most obvious thing, which is to put sensors on a helmet. The helmet, if it's doing its job, moves significantly with respect to the head. So we've been targeting one of the hardest substances in the body - your teeth. So we put sensors in a mouth guard that essentially snaps into the player's mouth and gets quite precise measurement of the head's motion. And then we can start to infer what's happening inside the brain. \n\n ###",

You'll no longer see 400,000 pick-up trucks sold in a year. And it means that we will see small trucks, smaller more fuel-efficient crossover vehicles. It won't be the end of vehicles that will hold six or seven or eight people, it won't be the end of vehicles that will be able to pull boats or trailers or carry loads, it just means you'll just see more fuel efficient and smaller versions of those vehicles.

Ms. JEAN JENNINGS (President and Editor in Chief, Automobile Magazine) : I would expect that Hummer is really seriously on the block because there is no reason for that vehicle. It is a toy and in relative terms they use a lot of gas. I would hate to just predict the demise of actual brands, but there is no doubt that the price of fuel is going to stay high once China turned from an oil exporting to an oil importing nation. That was our signal that the third world was ready to start using fossil fuels. That party's over it is just over.

One minute everybody was shopping, the next minute everybody was running for their lives. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Now, we're still waiting for the police to confirm a lot of details. We don't know exactly what caused this explosion, what kind of device. We do know that, as you mentioned, there was a second device that was taken away about four blocks north of this explosion site, and it was discovered hours later. And so we're still waiting for more information. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : A lot of unanswered questions at this hour. What are some of the threads that investigators are looking at? HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Well, besides what exactly was used to cause the explosion, we don't know what exactly the connection is between the explosion and the secondary device. We don't know who did it. And police say they're looking, scanning through surveillance video. There was also - there was an - also another explosion in New Jersey earlier yesterday. A device exploded in a garbage pail, and right before a charity run for the Marine Corps. And it was in a town about an hour and a half away in New Jersey. And right now investigators say they're not sure if that was a coincidence or if there's something more, a connection between what happened in New York yesterday. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Obviously, any time there's news of something like this happening in New York it's a difficult time for this city. They were marking only just a week ago the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. What's the vibe like in Manhattan right now? HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : You know, a lot of people who live nearby, who pass by are shaken up by what happened, can't believe that this happened on just, you know, what should've been a quiet Saturday night. And also, the explosion took place outside a home for blind residents. I spoke to a woman who says she's a friend with one of those residents, and they're very worried about how to get out of the building and their safety. And the whole area right now is an active crime scene. You know, not just the block where the explosion took place, but many of the blocks around it. Traffic has been stopped and we're not sure when those streets will reopen, so a big, big portion of Midtown Manhattan is shut down. So we'll see how long that will last. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : A developing story. We will be following it throughout the morning. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reporting on that explosion in New York City last night.

The U.S. has been supporting opposition forces trying to unseat President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been supporting Assad's regime. The cease-fire agreement happened because the U.S. and Russia decided to work together and coordinate airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. But then yesterday, a U.S.-led airstrike that was supposed to target the Islamic State instead hit some of Bashar al-Assad's forces. Russia then accused the U.S. of actually supporting ISIS. Russia also said they'd call an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's a complicated situation with serious consequences for the region. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : To talk more, we're joined by Liz Sly of The Washington Post. She's been following developments from Beirut, and she joins us via Skype. Liz, thanks so much for being with us. LIZ SLY : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What more can you tell us about how this airstrike on Syrian government troops happened? This is a grave mistake. LIZ SLY : Well, yes, we don't really know many details about how it happened. First of all, we had an allegation from the Syrian government. Then we had a very angry statement from the Russians saying that this strike had killed over 60 Syrian soldiers. Then we heard from the Pentagon, which said it had called off a strike in that area at the location mentioned after receiving telephone calls from Russia to say these are Syrian troops, stop bombing. They called off the strike. Now, they did say that they had informed Russia in advance about this location of the strike. They said that - hit it before, that ISIS has been there before. Apparently, the front lines had moved and the Pentagon didn't know the front lines had moved. \n\n ###",

It was very fragile from the get-go. Now what are the odds that the cease-fire will hold after this strike? LIZ SLY : Well, it's looking very, very shaky indeed. I don't think anybody ever held out much hope that this cease-fire was going to work. It really wasn't premised on any solution to the Syrian war. It was premised more on U.S.-Russian cooperation than it is about events on the ground in Syria. And neither site on the ground is particularly interested in cooperation, so all of them are very skeptical about the cease-fire in the first place. And this strike has come at an extremely inopportune time. We're supposed to start the U.S.-Russian cooperation tomorrow. Instead we have probably got huge amounts of diplomatic traffic between Moscow and Washington trying to unravel this mess that has occurred, and the cease-fire itself has sort of gone by the by. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What does this mean for the humanitarian crisis? I mean, the cease-fire was in essence supposed to give U.N. aid workers in particular the opportunity to finally get supplies in, especially to Aleppo, where the devastation has been so severe. LIZ SLY : Well, this was why we could already see that the cease-fire wasn't working because the terms of the deal were that there would be a pause in fighting for seven days during which aid would flow unimpeded to these areas and especially Aleppo. Now, on the fifth day of that, which was yesterday, we still hadn't seen any aid move, so the cease-fire already wasn't working. Now, last night at the U.N. the Russian ambassador said, oh, it was going to move this morning. It was all ready to move. But now we don't know if it will. But you don't know whether it would have or not because they haven't done it in the past five days. So that key plank of the cease-fire had already basically gone.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Is there a history of Klan activity in that town or in that area? JAIMI HAJZUS : Unfortunately, yes. There's a little bit of history there. When I was growing up in Coudersport in the 1990s, a man named Augusts Christ lived there and was active in the white supremacy movement. He would often harass anti-racist church leaders, neighbors and community members. We saw more activity through the 1990s, where people from out of town were coming in town to gather for these white supremacist events. August Christ then moved out of Potter County around 1999.

CHUCK CANTERBURY : Well, her plan, first of all, was much more of a social engineering plan than Mr. Trump's. He wants to work on the systemic causes of high crime, and Mrs. Clinton wants to work on police reform. And reform in a profession that doesn't need to be reformed is not the answer to fight crime. What we need to do is have people that will partner with us in these neighborhoods, help reduce unemployment, get people jobs. Doing a police reform package that she's been discussing in the campaign is - in our minds, falls way short of a real plan to attack crime. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Donald Trump, on Friday, made a statement that I want to ask you about. He suggested that Hillary Clinton's Secret Service detail should stop carrying guns and then, quote, \"see what happens to her.\" And it's not the first time he's used language which, to some people, sounds like inciting violence against Hillary Clinton. How can a union dedicated to safety, like yours, endorse a candidate who uses rhetoric that many hear as supporting or encouraging violence? CHUCK CANTERBURY : Well, the vote was taken weeks before he made that comment. And honestly, I believe his description - that that is more of a stab at her anti-Second Amendment stances that she's taken rather than the way the media has reported it.

So, again, no conclusive evidence that this was Russia or Russian-linked cyber spies, but it does prove that these systems are vulnerable. Do you think the U.S. government is preparing for future attacks that could genuinely undermine the election come November 8? ANDREW LEWIS : Well, it's already kind of succeeded. There's doubt about the elections, and so they could - people back in Moscow could say, we've already had some success. One of the problems for us - and in some ways, it's a good problem - is it's a federal system. So there's 51 different entities that control the state elections, and then there's thousands of counties, each with different machines, different processes. So it's not like you can find the place where the elections are controlled. ANDREW LEWIS : That makes it harder for the Russians to manipulate them. But it also makes it harder for us to come up with a defense because the U.S. government does not own the elections. The states do.

Taking your opponent's most positive trait and using it against him or her is a typical political tactic. But embracing your weaknesses and trying to use them on your opponent like a Judo throw - that's a little different.

Now, 15 years later, he is still the CEO. And he joins us on the line from New York. Thank you so much for taking the time. HOWARD LUTNICK : Hey. It's my pleasure, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I'm sure there are a lot of moments and conversations that stand out from that first 24-hour period. But could I ask you to share one or two that stick with you? HOWARD LUTNICK : Sure. So the night of September 11, I didn't really know who was alive and who wasn't alive. So we had a conference call. It was about 10 o'clock at night. And my employees called in. And I said, look, we have two choices. HOWARD LUTNICK : We can shut the firm down and go to our friends' funerals. Remember, that would be 20 funerals a day every day for 35 straight days. And I've got to tell you, If'm not really interested in going to work. All I want to do is climb under the covers and hug my family. \n\n ###",

And obviously, as I got down there, I saw that huge, black, billowing smoke. HOWARD LUTNICK : And the guy that was driving my car started crying. I was like, let's just - we got to get there. We just got to get there. And so I drove right to the building and got to the door of the building and started grabbing people as they came out.

And you can't really build a business back with four people. HOWARD LUTNICK : Basically, we went from being a great company that was making a million dollars a day to a company that was losing a million dollars a day.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : This debate is extremely important. You know, a hundred million people could be watching. The race is very tight. The latest ABC-Washington Post poll shows that it's a virtual tie. So for Hillary Clinton, she comes into the debate with the burden of high expectations, and she has a much harder task in the debates. Somehow, in 90 minutes, she has to show voters that she is honest, trustworthy and likable. And without looking angry or defensive or aggressive - because women candidates are penalized for that - she has to show that he is unqualified to be president. \n\n ###",

He has to be reasonable and calm and show a basic command of the facts because he has to help people imagine him as president because so many people think he's not qualified to be president. And the big question for Trump really is, which Trump shows up? Is he the one who is going to counterattack and insult his opponents, or, as he put it in an interview, he plans to be very, very nice? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right. We'll watch for that. I want to turn to something happening today, though. Both candidates are meeting separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in New York. President Obama had kind of a famously contentious relationship with Netanyahu. What do Clinton and Trump want out of their meetings with him? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : This meeting is much more important for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Clinton has met with Netanyahu many times. Trump needs to show that he's presidential. And every time he sits down with a foreign head of state, like the press conference he had in Mexico, he tries to do that. The interesting thing about this race is how little Israel has been an issue. And that really is because of Netanyahu himself, who has been very careful to stay out of this race, unlike in 2012, where he was widely perceived to be favoring Mitt Romney over Barack Obama. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And lastly, we need to get to this interesting, I guess is the word for it, endorsement that happened for Donald Trump this past week. Ted Cruz, a big rival of Trump's in the primary, came out and said that he was going to endorse Donald Trump. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Is that a big deal?

Regina Cheung, like the rest of us, felt that loss. But she also found something on that day, and it changed her life. REGINA CHEUNG : My name's Regina Cheung. I live in Sunnyvale, Calif. In September of 2001, I had just recently graduated from college and was beginning graduate school in the Boston area. And I had been in a relationship with my college boyfriend since freshman year. But over the summer, we decided even though we were both going to be going to Boston for graduate school that we wanted to kind of go on a break. I wasn't really sure if this was the right relationship for me outside of the bubble of college. I wanted to go into my new adult life as, you know, one person going forward on my own. And then I would see, you know, maybe this would work out, maybe it wouldn't. REGINA CHEUNG : And so the morning of September 11, after I called my mother the first thing I thought of was, where's my ex-boyfriend? And we had actually been in touch and were planning on, I think, having lunch that day. I had no way of really contacting him. But this was before cell phones were ubiquitous, so I just kind of took it on faith. OK, I'll go down to the - to meet him at the subway and hopefully he'll be there. And he was. And he hugged me. REGINA CHEUNG : And at that time it was like, OK, he's here with me now. I'm going to be OK no matter what's going on around - in the world around me. And I think at that point, that was when I knew that, yes, this was the person that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I'm sure that there was some conversation that happened afterwards, but that's not really what sticks in my mind. It's standing in the T with him, hanging onto him for dear life. REGINA CHEUNG : Everything went from zero to 100 pretty quickly after that. I moved in with him about six to nine months later. The following fall we got engaged, and we got married in 2003. And since then, we've moved to California. We now have two kids. And this weekend, we're celebrating my son's eighth birthday. We actually took him home from the hospital on September 11 in 2008. And that kind of took the sting out of - sting out of the day. September 11, 2001 - that was, like, the beginning of my adult life. \n\n ###",

Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Hi. Thanks. Good to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, explain this. A person arrested for crack cocaine offense on October 31st, a federal offense, would get a different sentence from someone who got theirs on November 1st? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Exactly. You know, the crack cocaine laws go back to the mid-1980s and punish crack cocaine offenses far more harshly than powder cocaine. And the U.S. Sentencing Commission, recognizing this disparity, has modified the sentences somewhat, but for people sentenced as November 1st. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : So, essentially, someone who is sentenced on October 31st might have gotten a 10-year sentence for crack offense. A similar person sentenced on November 1st is now getting roughly a nine-year sentence. And the question is, is there any justification for making those different or should we make it retroactive to people who've already been sentenced and are sitting in prison right now. \n\n ###",

Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Far higher. One quick example. There's a guy in prison right now by the name of Willie Mays Aikens. He's a former baseball star for the Kansas City Royals, played in the World Series, subsequently became addicted to drugs and started selling drugs and sold to an undercover agent. He was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and is in the middle of doing about a 20-year sentence. If this proposal goes through, to make it retroactive, he'll have about three years, cut-off in his sentence. He'll still do 17 o 18 years. If he'd been convicted of selling powder cocaine, he would have gotten a sentence about two and a half years only. That's the magnitude of the difference we're looking at. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So the Sentencing Commission is taking this up now. When could we expect a decision? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Well, some people have heard that they may make a decision in January. They can do it at anytime, so it's likely within the next month or two. They had a full day of hearings this week, heard very broad variety of views.

You know, back in 1986 when these laws were adopted by Congress, we have this relatively new drug that had come on the scene, crack cocaine. And the image of that - the crack user, whether or not it was entirely correct - was that of a young black male, sometimes young black female. I mean, we have cover of Newsweek magazine and similar - lots of stories on television. That was the image that came across. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : And the Congress passed the crack cocaine mandatory sentencing laws, really, in record time. There are virtually no hearings held, no discussion about - with experts in the field who knew something about addiction or treatment. And it's hard to escape the fact or the conclusion that the rush to judgment had something to do with the perception of the person who is being affected. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : It's intriguing to note that the Sentencing Commission has previously made retroactive changes for other drug sentencing laws, particularly for marijuana and LSD, where they change the law that made it retroactive. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Those changes primarily benefited white defendants. Here, the estimates are 85 percent of the people who would benefit from crack retroactivity would be African-Americans. So it's a very stark contrast before us.

That's equally true for people convicted of powder cocaine or a heroin offenses or anything else, and yet, we routinely let people out of prison every day. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Many of the people sentenced for these crack cocaine offenses will have served 10, 15, even 20 years or more before they're let out. And so if we can't come up with some way to provide these people with job skills, with life prospects after that many years in prison, that points to a much more fundamental problem.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And so my entire life, there's been this cognitive dissonance between the public characterization of my mother and my lived experience with her as my mom. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The public characterization of Hillary Clinton that began back in Arkansas had a lot to do with what she wasn't. She wasn't a Southerner. She was from Illinois. She wasn't a stay at home mom. She was a partner at a law firm. She wasn't Hillary Clinton. She was Hillary Rodham. Here's an interview she did with Arkansas public television in 1979. UNIDENTIFIED HOST : Does it bother you that because you don't use your husband's name that people think you're too liberal? And, after all, this is not a state known for liberalism. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : A 30-something-year-old Hillary Rodham essentially says too bad. \n\n ###",

Fast forward more than a decade. Her husband is running for president, and she is still uncomfortable with the public expectations of being a political wife. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas. But what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That was Hillary Clinton on NBC's \"Today Show\" in January of 1998, defending her husband after the allegations about Monica Lewinsky surfaced. But with that now-famous right-wing conspiracy remark, she was firing back at years of scandals that have loomed over the Clintons and complicated their political fortunes. DAVID MARANISS : You know, with the Clintons, a lot of things are true and false at the same time. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Again, journalist David Maraniss. DAVID MARANISS : It's part of the complexity of their place in American politics. And so whether it was an actual conspiracy or not, it is irrefutable that the right wing was more agitated by the Clintons and more prone to go after them in any way, whether something was accurate or not than any other Democratic politicians. And so by the time, you know, the Monica Lewinsky story broke and Hillary sort of rallied the troops and came to his defense and went on \"The Today Show\" and issued that statement and was really the strongest person in the White House during that crucial period when some - you know, many people were saying that Clinton would have to resign.

They also didn't trust her because she was fundamentally changing what it meant to be a first lady. Yes, she oversaw the Christmas decorations at the White House and hosted state dinners. But she also had a lot of power from the beginning, when her husband put her in charge of health care reform. Hillary Clinton was an important policy adviser. MELANNE VERVEER : I think it can best be summed up by the phrase - who elected her? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is Melanne Verveer. She was Hillary Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady and when she oversaw the administration's push for health care reform in 1993. Verveer says there was a lot of pushback to that appointment, even inside the White House. MELANNE VERVEER : Who elected her to come in and have this kind of power over a significant part of the U.S. economy, at least in terms of what health care represented? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's been a never-ending cycle with Hillary Clinton over the years. She gets criticized because of her personality or professional ambition, then she gets defensive. Then she gets criticized for being defensive, and she pulls the drawbridge up even further.

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Stores have almost 500 million pounds of turkey in stock, and there's still might not be enough for your Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey distributors say the number of frozen birds is the lowest it's been in five years, and that shortage might cost you. Mix that in with rising energy cost and you've got a perfect recipe for the biggest annual increase in holiday food prices since 1990. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we've got author and economist Julianne Malveaux. She's also the president of Bennett College. Welcome. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Hi, Farai, how are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Getting ready to help out my mom in the kitchen. Now, a turkey dinner's going to cost 11 percent more this holiday season compared to last year, that's according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.

It's partly energy cost. It's harder to transport things who are more expensive, anyway. It's partly the shortage of birds, which we might have predicted. People who are trying to contain cost really might want look at something other than a turkey, and there are other things our folk can buy. But if you want the traditional meal, 11 percent is higher than the increase in the consumer price index. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : But, Farai, the other thing that we should bear in mind is this particular Farm Bureau survey is a very weak survey - its 150 people at about 30 cities. And so there are other ways to look at this stuff, and the cost a conscious consumer can probably break even from last year. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I have to say that they say the average Thanksgiving meal will cost about $42 for a family of 10. That doesn't sound too bad to me. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : No, it really doesn't. And so while I think it's useful to track prices around this, I don't think that these are alarming data. And again, as I said, where are people actually shopping? What are they doing? If they're going to the Costcos and the other discount stores of the world, are they having the same challenges? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : So, I'm not sure that we want to get alarmed about this, but certainly, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, what we might want to do is think about the people who don't have the dollars, the access, the money or the food, and the people will be celebrating this thankful day alone or in dire circumstances. \n\n ###",

We have talked about this before and we're going to talk about it again. How, in general, should people think about holiday spending, whether it's on food or other items as something that fits into the flow of life? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : People should budget it. We know - we've all known that the holidays were coming since the beginning of the year, so hopefully people have budgeted. If you're having the big Thanksgiving dinner or something else, that's a part of your budget. And if you're doing something for a huge family, as many of us do, you're asking people maybe pitch in. Everyone just doesn't come and eat, but they come and share. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : But all - every spending incidents is something that should show up in someone's budget. We know that the average family spends, you know, between 100 and $1,000, over the holiday season, starting Thanksgiving going through Christmas for gifts and for other kinds of special occurrences, and those things should be budgeted. So people should really not get into the impulse thing of, hey, I've got my credit card and I love Uncle Joe and there's this great blue cashmere sweater I'm going to buy it for. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : It should be, okay, I've got 800 bucks in my budget because that's what I have. And, you know, this sweater has to be taken into the context of everything else that I might want to buy. That's hard for people. I mean, a lot of - unfortunately, Farai, we equate consumerism with caring, and that's something that we just have to unpack and stop doing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, let's talk a little bit more about these energy prices. You said it could affect the food prices. Now, there has been a conversation between American people and the media and head of Shell Oil. Shell Oil President John Hofmeister has been receiving a lot of angry letters, including one possible death threat from customers who want to know what's going on with these fuel prices. \n\n ###",

He recently wrapped up a 50-city tour to talk with folks about rising cost. Mr. JOHN HOFMEISTER (President, Shell Oil) : Well, it was more listen. Listen to Americans about their issues, their concerns to see what could we possibly do about it. And I tell you, I come away with a very strong conclusion and that conclusion is it's time for Americans to agitate their government to open up more oil and gas resources in this country. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So he says he's listening, but he also says that he wants people to agitate, to open up American oil resources. We, of course, import oil from many different nations. There was so much of a battle over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off of - over offshore drilling opportunities near Louisiana. Is this really what Americans want? Where is this conversation coming from? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Well, this is a matter of supply and demand, Farai. And the fact is that we are not supplying enough of our own energy. There are possibilities in our nation, but those possibilities have implications that are environmental and have other reverberations. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Mr. Hofmeister is - excuse me - is basically raising a question that keeps being raised of how far we're willing to go and how many dollars we're willing to spend to basically find a domestic resource. But they're wrong. He's raising, really, in my mind, the wrong question because the other question is, what have we been doing about our energy policy? What are we doing about conservation? And I understand why people are angry, when you see the way that oil prices have risen and you see these profits. It's not just the prices. It's the profits.

And these are issues that have unresolved, as you know, Farai, since the mid-'70s, when we had those first sets of lines and first sort of energy crisis that we've gone back to that again and again and again. But our nation has been unwilling because of the profiteering of folks like Shell to deal with issues of conservation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Mr. Hofmeister says that increasing the oil supply in the short term could help the research for renewable energy in the long term. What do you make of that? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Well, I think that's a pretty self-serving kind of comment, frankly. I do think that, obviously, the profits can be used for research, but then the responsible question might be, what have you been doing with the profits heretofore? The oil companies have never had profit-free quarters. You've not seen their prices - their stock prices drops significantly. So I - if that question were raised to me or posed to me, then I want to say, what is your record on research right now? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It seems, in a way, as if there is a Scylla and Charybdis effect. If you create oil here in the U.S., there are environmental risks. If you import oil, if you have oil shipped around, you can have, as we've seen recently, disasters where the beaches are flooded with oil. Is there any way to avoid some of these risks? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : No, there really isn't. This is all about looking at cause and benefits. And certainly, the environmental risks that we may face are real. The other risks that we face in terms of importing are real. And then there's the issue of the geopolitical situation around imports and what that means around availability. We know that, for example, some of the oil-producing countries are not in love with the United States and indeed may be moving some of their reserves to the euro as opposed to the dollar. These are things that we need to be concerned about when we talk about what's going on. But\u2026 \n\n ###",

Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : I think a lot of people - no. Currency dominance - and the British pound was once a dominant currency. Currency dominance speaks to national eminence. I mean, currencies will fluctuate. The euro has and will continue to do so, as does the dollar or any other, the pound, the peso, you name it. Currencies will fluctuate. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : What people really doing are voting with their feet about their opinion of the United States. In other words, you don't think much of the United States, you're not going to hold dollars. You think better of the euro, you're going to hold euros. You think better of, you know, you pick the country, you're going to hold their currency. So we've seen essentially people make decisions about what they think of our country and flip it into the currency.

Why was it more powerful, in your mind, to go back to something that you'd already done? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : WILL.I.AM: So really, just those lyrics - Father, Father, Father, help us. Send some guidance from above 'cause people got me, got me questioning, where is the love? It's like a prayer, actually. I remember my grandma, she used to pray for us and say the our father prayer. She would repeat the same prayer to keep us guided where our heart is aimed at the right direction. So why don't we just take a deep breath, stop all this division, stop all this, like, is the media telling me that the world's racist or is the world racist? Or is it a lack of investment? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's really not racism. It's really just, like, this system that's in place that - we just have to look at it because the same folks that are filling up the prisons are the same folks that we neglected their education on. And it just so happens to be black people. So, yes, from that perspective, black lives matter. But all lives matter, all lives to pay attention to this system that we have to just, like, untangle. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you don't buy what you're saying is a narrative out there that America hasn't grappled with its racist past, that there is still racism in this country? \n\n ###",

So let's pick up with what happened last night and just put it in context. Eddie, Nevada is being called the Latino primary state because almost one in four Nevadans are of Latino descent. Do you think that that's a fair assessment? Mr. EDDIE ESCOBEDO (Founder and Publisher, El Mundo Newspaper) : Well, we were (audio gap) Nevadans were not satisfied with what happened last night because we wanted to talk about the local issues of state and, of course, city issues than - or what's affecting Nevada. And within - the only thing they discussed was the Yucca Mountain and, of course, the - illegal immigration. But there's some more issue that we are concerned with and we were not able to. And, of course, for some reason, I was not very satisfied with the way it was conducted because there was no exchange between the candidates and the moderator, and a lot of times, we didn't get the right answer, because they went around, not giving the specific answer, yes or no. Mr. EDDIE ESCOBEDO (Founder and Publisher, El Mundo Newspaper) : And so, even though we were very proud and very happy it happened here in Nevada and it was televised national - I mean, worldwide. So, definitely, that's a plus plus for Las Vegas. But here, again, we - Nevada residents were not happy because of the issues that were discussed here last night. Same issues. They have the war, the health care. But the issues that affect Nevada were not discussed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, let met get Bob in here. Don't you think could be just fallout from the television era that people are not playing to the local audience, they're playing to the camera. Mr. BOB BUTLER (Reporter, KCBS Radio, San Francisco) : You know, I think that's true for all candidates. Nowadays, they know that every time that they say a word, it could be seen by the entire country. So, you might have people who are in Nevada but they're really thinking about that, you know, that state still up for grabs, some place in the Midwest or some place back east. So their messages are all - you know, I don't even think these people write their own messages anymore. I think the messages are written by strategists and spin doctors. \n\n ###",

You have New York governor Eliot Spitzer reversing his controversial plan to provide undocumented workers with driver's licenses. He said it would improve public safety.

And in your testimony, you warned of, quote \"catastrophic public safety consequences if prisoners are released early.\" Why do you think that's the case? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Well, I think, primarily, because 80 percent of the people that would be released are previously being convicted of crimes prior to this last arrest. Most of them have multiple prior convictions, and 35 percent of those that are in jail for crack possession possesses firearms during the commission of their crime. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : And if we could have - under the commission's own data, we could have a projected 2,500 this year alone, back out on the street, and 5,000 within 24 months. And with that, and with the recidivism rate for crack, we believe that there will be a rather large upswing in crack-related crimes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I want to get into two different areas. One is prison overcrowding, the other one is race and sentencing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Some people have looked at this whole move by the Sentencing Commission and said, well, maybe it's partly about prison overcrowding.

I believe that there is a underlying issue of finances because I heard of a witness testify that this would save $87 million annually to the federal prison system. And that's fairly significant dollar amounts for the every day person. But in the overall picture of the federal prison, $87 million versus the damage that criminals put on the victims in America, $87 million is not an equal wash. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about the issue of race and sentencing? Powder cocaine much lower sentences, per gram. Is there any racial disparity in your mind or are there reasons why the crack cocaine sentences are higher? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Well, there are reasons and - but we readily admit that there is a disparity. But when we testified earlier before the commission made the changes, we asked for an increase in the powder cocaine rather than reduce powder cocaine or crack cocaine. We thought they should be equal punishments, but then we thought that the punishment for the powder should move up rather than the other way around. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Congress, originally, passed crack laws because of the huge upswing in crime when crack first hit the market. They talk about the chemical compound being very similar. Well, as a practitioner, I can tell you they may test out as the same drug in a lab. But on the street, they're two different products.

They've - they create cheaper drugs for people that can't afford them. And unfortunately, when they've done that, they've created two extremely dangerous drugs with crack and crystal meth.

He was indicted by a U.S. grand jury because of his alleged use of steroids. He says he never knowingly used performance-enhancing drugs. He could face up to 30 years imprisonment, steep fines. Does that potential punishment fit the crime if there was one? Mr. BUTLER : Well, you know, the Bonds situation is so strange because at the time he was accused of using steroids, steroids were not banned by Major League Baseball. And now, people say they were against the law, but I mean, you know, athletes have gotten away with this kind of stuff for many, many, many years. We've learned that a lot of other people have been using steroids, too. Whether or not he faces 30 years in prison, I - that's debatable. I mean, he had no other criminal record. I mean, I don't know if will face that much time. I think the question really is, why Barry Bonds? Why is it, all of a sudden that Barry Bonds is the poster child for steroids use? Mr. BUTLER : I don't have an answer to that question, but I think there is a lot of trouble. A lot of people will be calling talk radio shows here saying, you know, we don't care. We don't care, the guy's an athlete. He used steroids, so what? And then he's in trouble because the U.S. attorney says we asked him pointblank if he used them, he said no, and we have evidence to say that he was lying. Well, that's going to go to court, we'll see what happens when it goes to court. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Eddie, do you think if he's convicted, he can kiss that homerun record goodbye?

And as like the previous young man says, that story has been used by other players. However, none of them has been banished as Bonds. And why Bonds? Why - because there is someone - his name was in every paper, his name was on every radio talk show and every TV show. And definitely, who are you going to pick, the guy that's on top, the same thing that they're doing on the political world. Who are they attacking, the leader.

Mr. GONSALVES : But it - for me, I've never been quite able to figure out why this focus has been almost solely on Barry Bonds, given, you know, I've got a number of questions. Our smaller ballparks - you know, for me, I am not even a believer necessarily that steroids is a performance-enhancing drug in baseball. In more physical sports like football, I can see it. Baseball, hitting a baseball and these kinds of things are so difficult, I'm just not convinced that it matters that much. And I think a lot of fans feel the same way. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Bob, before we let all three of you go, I want you to just tell us a little bit about Chauncey Bailey. He was honored at a California fallen journalist memorial wall, murdered in August while covering criminal allegations surrounding a Muslim bakery in Oakland. What were people saying about him as a person and as a reporter? Mr. BUTLER : Well, I was at this - at Cal State north, where they had the ceremony. And what I was telling people was basically what - the kind of a person and the kind of a journalist Chauncey was. Chauncey was the kind of journalist that we all - we all know him. The guys that's at every event, always asks the first question. In fact, his boss called him the Helen Thomas of Bay Area journalists. And if you didn't answer the question, he was the guy that would ask for a follow-up, and if you didn't answer the question after the follow-up, he'd get you outside, to get you to answer the question. That's how he was as a journalist. \n\n ###",

And essentially, what he did was, he said, okay, these kids aren't reading the newspapers, so I'm going to start a newspaper at the school. And he would take it home - he got the kids put their papers into a box, the stories into a box. He would take the box home at night, on a Wednesday night, and would edit the newspapers on his typewriter. And then Thursday, would print them out and take them to the school on Friday, the kids will read the newspaper. Mr. BUTLER : He would also bring newspapers on the bus, as he - on his way to work because he said he saw people sitting there, not doing anything but staring out the window. So he brought newspapers to them so they could read. The guy really cared about learning and education. He cared about people. And I've had - a few people here in the Bay Area say he was not, you know, a hero on the black community. He was a champion for the black community. He really cared. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Bob.

If you live long enough, people will come and go from your life. Jeff Obafemi Carr tells us his story of what can happen when the long lost reappear. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor and Playwright) : I wasn't expecting to see anyone I knew that afternoon. I was leaving my office talking to my 12-year-old daughter about her school day. And as we were getting into the car, I noticed this cat sitting on the bench smoking a cigarette. I half-nodded the obligatory, what's up black man, and started to get in my car. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor and Playwright) : He took a long drag on the cigarette and said, you don't remember me, do you? I stood up and looked at him squarely. Looking into his eyes, I use peripheral vision to instantly scan his somewhat skeletal face, receding hairline, and dark mouth. I wasn't sure where I knew him from, but he was vaguely familiar. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor and Playwright) : You did a good job in that movie playing that preacher. That told me two things. He had seen the \"Second Chance\" and he recognized me from it. I still didn't remember him, though. But I'm always thankful when someone thinks enough of me to pay my work a compliment, so I said, I appreciate that brother, man. Thank you. And started back into the car. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Actor and Playwright) : You still stay out south? Uh-oh. This cat knew where I grew up? Yeah, I still stay in the neighborhood. He leaned forward and took another drag before flicking away the cigarette. What's your brother Greg doing these days? Wait a minute. This cat knew me. I explained that Greg was now a popular professor at Howard University and that a lot of people in the neighborhood had gone on to success, blah, blah, blah.

Given how ubiquitous offensive words are in the U.S. vernacular, I think we are seeing a shift in what we think a bigot is. It used to be simple. Bigots had a certain level of racial animus. But now, some blacks are trying to convince us that such words are terms of endearment. And we wonder how other folks can find themselves confused and put Sharpton's number on speed dial.

And lots of people had things to say about preachers potentially profiting from their flocks. A reader named Bill O'Brien(ph) says people who attain wealth through religious teachings are charlatans. Mega churches should be taxed as the businesses that they are today. GEOFFREY BENNET : But Joe Jordan(ph) says one can be financially transparent and still exercise extremely poor judgment. The big question leaders in any venue need to ask is, does this decision demonstrate personal integrity, good judgment and a genuine commitment to serving and not taking? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm looking ahead. We are going forth into the holiday season. You wouldn't happen to have some Web-based news you can use for travel. GEOFFREY BENNET : Actually, I do. You can call it an early gift from NEWS & VIEWS. We posted some advice on booking cheap travel for the holidays. Most people know about sites like Orbits and Expedia, but they're actually some newer, lesser known sites they can actually get to a better deal. So we posted links to all of those and some tips on what to do to save time and money once you arrive to wherever you're going this season. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : All right. I've got to check that out, time to make the Christmas reservations. Geoff, thanks So much. \n\n ###",

So, let's talk - we're really talking about the east of the continent and the last week, dozens people have been killed in heavy fighting in and around Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. Tens of thousands of people have fled the area, journalists have been killed, Ethiopian troops were killed as well, and one dead soldier's body was dragged through the streets. What's behind all these violence? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : The invasion has failed. The Ethiopian invasion, fundamentally, has failed. The transitional government that was put in is attempting to suppress opposition, not just the Islamists, but also trying to suppress the media itself, and so tension is arising. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give us a little bit of background - just briefly, we've talked about this. But on the question of the Ethiopians being in Somalia, give us the backgrounder on that. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : The Union of Islamic Courts, an Islamist group, which is something along the lines of the Taliban, succeeded in taking over some - a good chunk of Somalia and restricting the ability of the clans to create chaos. The Ethiopian government was deeply worried about the situation there. There has been historical antagonisms between Ethiopia and Somalia. And with the apparent encouragement of the U.S. government, the Bush administration, Ethiopia invaded Somalia, routed the Union of Islamic Courts and everyone thought that that was that - or at least many people thought that was that. The Islamists regrouped and they've been conducting a guerilla war against Ethiopians and the Somali allies. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, last week, Ethiopia deployed 2,000 more troops to Mogadishu. Some people blame the violence on the resentment towards the Ethiopian troops who monitor the area. What about civilians? How were they caught in this conflict? \n\n ###",

So the situation is quite dramatic and unfortunately, it's not getting the kind of attention it needs here in the United States. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you have Ethiopia and Somalia, and now you have Ethiopia and Eritrea - neighboring nations. Is this a border war? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : This is one of the greatest tragedies of the last decade. Here you have two countries that's succeeded in building a - something close to a partnership through the overthrow of the Ethiopian junta that was called the Derg in early '90s. Eritrea achieved independence, and there was collaboration, and there was even talk of some sort of regional alignment that could take place between the two countries. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : And then things started to unravel. And it's basically - what seems to be at route is a level of political opportunism that first emerged in Ethiopia, but now, I must say, also in Eretria, where the leadership is trying desperately to hold on to power, and it's fanning the flames of nationalism and war.

It's 25 kilometers round in a town called Badme, B-A-D-M-E. And it's not exactly what you'd call an oasis. And that's why many observers, in looking at the situation, say, no, no, no. This is not about the territory. This is about something else. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : And unfortunately, I think that the something else is that it becomes a convenient means for the Ethiopian government, which refuses to implement the border commission resolution of the crisis. It becomes a means for them to rally the troops against the evil bogeymen in Eritrea. It's almost like the beginning of World War I. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Are you saying then that this is, in some ways, a fictional conflict -a real conflict with nothing more than mutual animosity fueling it? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : It's close to a fictional conflict. What's at stake, what's being said that's at stake really does not pass the straight-face test. The Ethiopians are clearly violating the agreement that was established by the border commission. That is true. At the same time, the Eritreans are not permitting peacekeepers to fully observe the territory that's in dispute. So when you have a situation like that, and you have two very well-armed militaries, you have a recipe for a potential disaster. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Ethiopia has been considered a key U.S. ally in the war on terrorism, and Eritrea has been considered as possibly being added to the list of states that sponsor terrorism.

There's absolutely no foundation for this. But what it does is that it gives militaristic elements in Ethiopia, the idea that they have the green light to potentially attack Eritrea and have the support of the United States. It was the most idiotic move that anyone could imagine, where you have a situation that could blow up at any moment. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let's turn briefly to Sudan. There is a truce between north and south. Could be unraveling, what is the latest on that? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : Two years ago, there - a truce was signed. As you know, between the north and the south, ending a civil war that essentially started in the early 1960s. Some would say it started actually in the 1950s. And the northern government based in Khartoum under President al-Bashir was supposed to take several steps, including confirming a border between the north and the south, taking political steps or steps towards political reform, and third, working out agreements around the issue of oil, because oil have been discovered in the southern Sudan, which is what this dispute is really largely about. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : The al-Bashir government, by most accounts, has taken very few steps and appears to have been stalling. The southern - the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, which is the major force in the south, essentially had enough and withdrew its representatives from the government, from the Government of National Unity, said that al-Bashir must follow through or they're no longer going to participate in the Government of National Unity.

Maybe a new job, a new relationship? How about just a different toothpaste. Our humorist, Brian Unger, says you might be evolving. BRIAN UNGER : Oprah Winfrey is on the cover of Black Enterprise Magazine this month. Now you probably remember when she was on the cover back in 1986, and you're asking, hey, Oprah, what has changed since then? Well, the answer according to Oprah, nothing. In 22 years, Oprah says nothing about her has changed. In Oprah's world, there's still a Camaro in her driveway. Kurt Waldheim is president of Austria, and bacon is $1.75 per pound. Nothing has changed. BRIAN UNGER : But what she does say is very interesting. Oprah says, quote, \"I've evolved.\" Oprah has evolved right into her brand new yet to be launched very own cable TV network, called \"OWN\" which is going to be on the air very soon because an hour of Oprah a day is just not enough. BRIAN UNGER : So how do we know, or how does Oprah know she's evolving? And what will she look like to archeologists in one million years, when they find petrified Oprah in a forest, will they say, \"she was very evolved?\" Is evolving painful? More importantly, who can evolve and who can't? Well, I can tell you that I'm pretty sure I'm evolving too. Into a new more expensive apartment next week and it hurts. Now I'm not changing addresses, I'm evolving into a new address because I got robbed at my old address. Two gang bangers standing in my driveway with all my stuff in their van caused me to evolve.

How about tomorrow's primaries in Montana and South Dakota. Democratic politics come to the end of the primary season and still no candidate. NPR's Senior Washington Editor Ron Elving is here. Ron, I said no candidate, actually too many candidates perhaps? No solution. No nominee. Hillary did better than expected in yesterday in Puerto Rico, but Politico.com is reporting today that she is cutting loose some campaign staffers. What does all this mean? RON ELVING : It means that we are at the end of the schedule, as you say, and there's really not much point in having advanced people running around the country, setting up events if all the voting is over in the states and territories and we've had something like 57 different events in states and territories. And it's really all coming down to negotiations and meetings of committees and things of that nature. And really you don't need an advanced staff for that.

Her best chance to really change the dynamic went up went out the door with the Rules and Bylaws Committee on Saturday which essentially seated the delegations as we knew they had to do, but cut their votes by half. And also a portion of the delegates in a manner, in  Michigan that really doesn't help Hillary Clinton at all. And what she got out of Florida was, of course, reduced by half. So, she didn't get nearly the benefit she had hoped for there and while she did do very well in Puerto Rico, even exceeding expectations, there just weren't that many delegates to be gained there. And so, at the end of the day, she still needs to turn an enormous number of superdelegates her way and it doesn't seem to be happening. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, the superdelegates have been asked by party leaders, and there's a lot of talk that Wednesday is their day, all the voting will be done. Is there a day to come out and say, OK, this is where we are? Is that going to happen? RON ELVING : Yes, I think largely it will. Bear in mind that many of these superdelegates are members of Congress, about 15 Senators, a much larger number of members of the House. And they have been telling their constituents back home, let's let everybody vote. Let's hear from the last states and territories and then we'll decide, as superdelegates, what we think we ought to do. Also there are many personal promises out there. Where the Clintons, and I say that plural, both Hillary and Bill, have implored people, please don't commit. If you can't be with us, just don't say anything until all the voting is over. Give us every opportunity to make our case. And of course, we'll also be at the end of that scheme. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So, if Barack Obama gets to the new magic number, which is 2,118 now.

RON ELVING : Only this, that as Terry McCall her Campaign Chairman said yesterday, superdelegates can change their minds. So, if he has an absolute, that is to say that Barack Obama has a absolute majority among pledged delegates, which it seems he will have, and if he also has a clear majority among superdelegates, well, those are the only kinds of delegates there are.

A prominent Seattle attorney, David McDonald, is on it.  He's also an undeclared superdelegate.  David, we spoke by phone late yesterday.  You said you'd just gotten to Washington, that you were learning a lot and that things are evolving. What can you tell us? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : They have not evolved very far as far as I can I tell you.  It sounds like there is no clear consensus emerging anywhere at this point, and we'll be probably addressing this most of the day tomorrow. \n\n ###",

I don't know whether that's going to work. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Here's something I've gleaned from looking around political websites today, this is from First Read at MSNBC.  It says the most likely compromise would give Senator Clinton most of the Florida delegates but split Michigan 50-50.  Have you heard about this compromise, and what is appealing about it? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : I don't think I've heard about it.  What would be appealing about at least part of it is when all else fails, people tend to simply divide things.  I don't mean to be flip, but putting aside all of the other rules and issues, the difficulty in states that did not hold a process that met the rules, is trying to estimate what would have happened if they had held a process, and that's part of the problem.  If you decided you would do something, how would you select the people, and who would they be pledged to, and so on. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, what are you thinking about?  What could you offer to this group of people tomorrow as a compromise, as a way out of this? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : Assuming that the two state parties actually did make good faith efforts to try to get themselves into compliance, I would consider lifting part of the sanction, and give them some delegates.  I personally would probably prefer to do it with fractional votes in order to have more people come and see the convention, rather than have fewer people with full votes.

Debt collection agencies may get more aggressive when they go after unpaid medical bills. The Wall Street Journal reports today some hospitals have started auctioning off their uncollected health care bills to the highest bidder. For an explanation of where we're going with this we turn to Marketplace's Bob Moon. Bob, what's the significance of this for people who maybe are behind in their medical bills? How would they notice a difference? BOB MOON : Well on the surface this isn't much different from the way that debt collection agencies usually work, Alex. They buy the right to collect outstanding debts at a discount and they get a share of the take. The difference here is that some of these hospitals have started to auction off their debt on a couple of online websites that have been developed just for this purpose and that turns the debt collection firms into bidders. The hospital may get more money but the flip side of that is that buying a debt can become more expensive for the collectors and this arrangement has the collectors either buying the debt outright or providing a guarantee of payment to the hospitals for access to these unpaid bills. Well consumer groups this could end up meaning the debt collectors are going to have to be more aggressive in going after the person who owes this debt because the collectors are going to need to recoup their investment right up front. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Right. You know there are consumer advocates and also healthcare advocates, many of them. What do they say to this? BOB MOON : Well for one thing, they say once the bills get turned over to the collector that separates the patient from a possible financial assistance policies and other options that the hospitals might offer. We spoke a short time ago to Mark Rukavina, he's the executive director of the Boston-based Access Project and advocacy group that's focused on medical debt. Mr. MARK RUKAVINA (Executive Director, Access Project) : Our advice to people who have medical bills that they're just struggling to pay is don't ignore them. Act promptly whether you get a letter from the provider or a letter from a collection agency. We've just seen time and time again that people who have been far more effective at working to resolve these bills and design repayment plans with providers than they have when the bills are held with other parties. \n\n ###",

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And I'm Alex Chadwick. Lucy is now two years old. An occasion absolutely no one is celebrating. Lucy is a mud volcano on the island of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia. It's on the eastern tip of the island. It's already swallowed the homes of more than 30,000 people. Scientists and displaced Indonesians blame a gas company for causing the eruption of sludge two years ago. Richard Davies is a geologist with Durham University in England. He's been tracking this volcano since it first appeared. Richard Davies, what usually causes a mud volcano? And how is this one different? Professor RICHARD DAVIES (Geologist, Durham University) : They are normally caused by natural processes. Under the ground you have something called geological pressure and this pressure, sometimes, can be abnormally high. And so where it reaches abnormally high levels, it can force fluids to the surface. Normally through natural fractures and breaks in the rocks. There are thousands of mud volcanoes on the earth. What makes this mud volcano very different is that this one was almost certainly triggered by drilling a gas exploration well. ALEX CHADWICK, host : This gas well was being drilled by a company that belongs to the richest man in Indonesia. He's connected to the government. There's a lot of back and forth on this. A local court has said that it thinks it was a natural disaster. Professor RICHARD DAVIES (Geologist, Durham University) : Well, yeah, there was an earthquake on the 27th of May, two days before the start of the mud volcano on the 29th of May, 2006. Almost exactly two years ago. This earthquake has been looked at, in detail, by an American scientist, Michael Magner and he decided that the earthquake is too small and too far away to have had any influence on the triggering this mud volcano. My part in the research has been to look at the drilling data and in fact we have very clear indications that while they were drilling the well, they basically had a series of operational events, which led to the subsurface blowout. Which means that the fluid within the well leaked out towards the surface and that kicked off the process in which Lucy was born. \n\n ###",

The largest are out in Azerbaijan, but those mud volcanoes are formed over tens of thousands - possibly millions of years. It is the fastest growing. So it's an incredible fast growing mud volcano that is in its infancy.

It's a sight to behold, I mean, reading through the various literature and looking at pictures does not prepare you for seeing this thing. It has a crater in the middle of it, a vent, which is 50 meters wide with mud and gas and steam coming out of it. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Is the land in danger of collapsing if this water runs out? I mean what is going to happen there? Geologically? Professor RICHARD DAVIES (Geologist, Durham University) : It is collapsing and so we've recently published a paper - we're working with Indonesians. They have taken accurate GPS measurements, which can measure a fraction of a centimeter of downward movement. And they have also used satellite images to see whether the land has gone up  or gone down. It is of course going down. The weight of the mud, and because you are taking mud and fluid from underneath the ground, is causing the area to subside. The maximum rate, if you like, are four centimeters a day. That equates to something like 14 meters a year and if you multiply it by ten years, you can quickly extrapolate the worst-case scenario.  And so my point is you really have to look at this new data because it shows that the area will eventually be impacted by the mud volcano, it's not just the area covered by mud.

Should they begin saving for retirement or pay down that debt? What about that governments stimulus check you may have already received? Should you use it to pay off debt? Should you use it to pay off your car loan or save that money? Here to discuss your options for paying debt is Day to Day's personal finance contributor, Michelle Singletary. Hi, Michelle. MICHELLE SINGLETARY : Hi. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK. This is your age-old dilemma, one that maybe you've talked about a few times on this show. You're in debt, should you pay off the debt first and then save, or save first and then pay off the debt? MICHELLE SINGLETARY : The answer is both and it's interesting. We could talk about this every single week and people still don't get this, because so many people are in debt and they're so overwhelmed they don't know what to do. But here's the thing. You got to do both, you've got to save and you have to pay down debt. And when I say save I mean save for an emergency, save for your retirement. If you got kids eventually going to college, save for their college fund, but you've also got to pay down the debt. MICHELLE SINGLETARY : So if you've got a little bit of money divide it by how many pots you need to. Put a little bit toward savings and some to debt because the thing is if you only throw it at the debt, if something happens and something always happens, you'll end up going into more debt to cover that expense. So say your car breaks down, you have no savings and you're trying to pay down a credit card debt, well what are you going to do? You're going to use that credit card. So you need to put something aside for the things in life that happen. \n\n ###",

So you are a fresh out of college graduate. You get 1200 dollars let's say in gift money for your graduation and you have zero saving. What do you do? MICHELLE SINGLETARY : You've got to save that money. Don't go buying any clothes. Don't, you know, don't go out dinner with the other graduates. Put that money away. You're going to need - any of us who've ever had our first job understand what it's like to really be out there without help from mom and dad, without the cover of college. So you want to build at least a three-month living expenses. Everything, rent, cable, car payment, especially those cell phone bills, you want to add all those up, multiply times three. That's how much you need to have in an emergency fund, so you need every penny of that money. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK. So let's say you've done that, you have your three months emergency supply. Should you then use money to pay down a debt or student loans? MICHELLE SINGLETARY : Well you're not done saving for emergency just yet. I have talked to people about this and I've figured out listen, you need an emergency fund and something else I call a \"life happens fund.\" That's for the car repairs, dental work - you know all the little things that you need to take care of. So you want to have three to six months living emergency fund and about 500 to 1000 dollars in the life happens fund to tide you over for those unplanned expenses. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And I'm Madeleine Brand. Most people agree that something must be done about global warming. Today, the Senate takes up a massive bill that would cut greenhouse gas emissions by about two-thirds by the year 2050. The Climate Security Act has bipartisan support and support from industry as well as some major environmental groups. However, this bill has virtually no chance of passing. And to find out why, we called up Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Ball. Jeff, first tell us broadly what's in this bill. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, what's in this bill is something that affects essentially everyone in the economy from every industry in the economy to regular consumers. Broadly what this does is put a cap on emissions of global warming gasses, notably carbon dioxide which is produced whenever a fossil fuel like oil or coal is burned. So fundamentally what this bill does is create higher prices to consume the sort of energy that powers everything in this economy. And as a result of that what you have is a huge food fight in Washington over the details of this, which are really going to determine who gets hit the hardest. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And who's for it and who's against it? Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, one thing is that this fight is often described as a partisan fight with Democrats versus Republicans. And really it's not that. It's really a regional fight. Energy politics and environmental politics in this country, like around the world, are mostly regional. Where people are in the Congress, just like out in the country, depends on what kind of fuel they use for electricity largely. So coal-state Senators, whether Democrat or Republican are likely to be at a different place in this debate than Senators say from the North-East and California who get most of their electricity from natural gas or nuclear energy, which is less emitting than coal. \n\n ###",

You have interesting splits, say, between the auto industry on the one hand and the oil industry on the other hand. There's a very broad group called the US Climate Action Partnership, which is based in Washington. And interestingly, represents companies sort of across the industrial spectrum. I mean, among its members are General Electric and General Motors, both of whom make equipment that is used in activities that produce quite a lot of emissions. And you might not expect them to support this bill, but they do, and basically the reason is that they figure that like it or not, they're going to get hit with a climate bill, and they better be involved early on in shaping it so that they can shape it to their advantage. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : The other thing is that if you look at this bill itself, you see this fascinating sort of matrix of slicing the pie. So this bill actually names a broad group of constituencies and parses out how much of these pollution permits that the bill would create would be divvied up among these various constituencies. And this is a big, big economic issue, because these permits are expected to be worth something like perhaps 25 dollars apiece. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : These are permits, each of which allows its bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, if this bill is passed, when it takes effect. And each of these things, if it's worth 25 dollars apiece, will collectively be worth more than 100 billion dollars in the first year of this bill. And so to the degree that any constituency gets these things, it can either use them to lessen its cost of compliance, or it can actually sell them on the market and make money. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : And so this is largely seen as an environmental bill, but fundamentally this is sort of like a tax bill. It's an economic bill with huge stakes and essentially everyone who uses energy in this economy is at the federal bar trying to maximize his take. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And this is why the group Friends of the Earth is opposed to it, because they see it as a big giveaway to polluters. \n\n ###",

I mean, lots of - groups who are opposed to this on the environmental side think that it's too soft. One big debate is whether the quote unquote \"big polluters\" ought to be given a chunk of their pollution permits or whether they ought to have to pay for all of them. There was a big fight in Europe, which created a system like this a couple of years ago, where there was a sense that large emitting companies got windfall profits. That is they were given permits for free and still electricity prices rose and their profits rose as well. There were investigations into that, and that hangs as a specter over this whole discussion in the US. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So this is supported by, or sponsored by Republican John Warner of Virginia and former Democrat, now independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. So these two are veterans of the Senate. You would think that they could bring along enough Senators with them. Why can't they? Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, remember two things about where we are on June 2nd, 2008. We are facing four dollar a gallon gasoline at the pump, and we're five months away from a presidential election. Both of those things ultimately argue against passing a climate bill, and here's why. First of all, again everyone agrees that on some level passing a climate cap bill is going to increase energy prices, including ultimately increasing gasoline prices at some level. Now there are many studies that say it won't be too much. Studies disagree on this, but nevertheless it's not a message that a politician wants to deliver to a consumer today. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Secondly, they particularly don't want to deliver that message as the presidential election heats up. And it's interesting that all three leading presidential candidates apparently will not be in the Senate today for this debate. Now they all say that they have reasons not to be there, but it is sort of interesting to note because at some level this climate bill has been a subject of discussion on the campaign trail. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Yeah, I mean, interestingly, John McCain has recently said that he says global warming is real and something needs to be done about it. \n\n ###",

And they all essentially say that, but then when you parse the details, they're all very careful and they've become increasingly careful in recent weeks not to say that anything should be done at all costs. I mean, I think most of them say that things should be done such that it doesn't kill the economy. And that's a big caveat, which leaves a lot open to interpretation. Because look, at the end of the day, in order to win the presidency, any of these candidates is going to need support from states that depend heavily on fossil fuels. I mean, notably coal states. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : And it's pretty clear that depending on how this thing shakes out, coal states are going to get hit harder than other states. There are provisions in this bill that would seek to address that, to sort of parse out some more largesse as compensation to coal states. But, you know, this debate largely has been had in this country so far in a very esoteric, general 30,000-foot level. And I think what we're about to see is this debate get had on a more detailed level. And when that happens people are going to start to realize that there's not a free lunch here. And that's not going to be a politically popular realization, probably. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So you expect it not to pass this week, but perhaps after November it might be revived.

Should they or should they not take psychiatric medication? Some people are afraid that could hurt the fetus. A recent study looked at the risks and offered some recommendations, and Dr. Sydney Spiesel is here now to share the results of that study. He's a Yale Medical School professor, a pediatrician, and a regular on this program. Welcome back, Syd. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : Thank you, Madeleine, always nice to be here. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, first of all, tell us the risks that this medication, some of the medication, could pose to developing fetuses. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : There are risks that we know and risks that we don't know, and I want to make that distinction here. The risks that we know - the known ones are usually physical risks. For example, we know that if women take Lithium or Paxil, that there's a small increase in risk for the developing fetus of heart abnormalities. There are some drugs that are called mood stabilizers that are used often for bipolar disorder, also used to treat seizures, drugs like Depakote and Tegretol. And again, they're associated with a small risk of physical malformations, and those are the things that we're most aware of. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : But you know, there are some worries that there may be unknown risks that we simply don't know, although we've been looking for them. For example, the possibility that these medications might cause subtle neurological or behavioral consequences later on. And then there's still more unknowable things - what about the possibility, as we're beginning to understand, that there might be individual genetic differences, which might make only one or rare developing fetus especially susceptible to risk. \n\n ###",

Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : Oh, they're very acute indeed. You know, the problem is that if women who need these medications are off their medications, some are not going to be able to comply well with prenatal care. Perhaps they're more likely to drink, to smoke, to use other drugs, that I think for many of them, often is a kind of self-medication. And these could be much more harmful. Smoking, drinking, using other drugs could be much more harmful than the medications. Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : If an illness is untreated and it gets worse and worse, then after the baby's born, the mother might not be in a psychological condition to be able to fully attach emotionally to the baby, or might not be adequately attentive to the baby, or give unfocused care. Or in fact, if she has a very serious thought disorder, she might do completely irrational things. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, Syd, this, I guess, collection of recommendations is put out by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and what do they say, what do they recommend? Dr. SYDNEY SPIESEL (Professor, Yale Medical School) : Well, the most important thing is that adequate care for the mother often best serves the needs of the fetus. If the mother's illness is severe, you sometimes need to use somewhat risky medications if other choices aren't available or if they're ineffective. It's best to use a single medication even at a higher dose rather than a collection of meds. It's always important to keep in mind that the most risky time for developing embryo fetus is the third to eighth week of gestation. And they urge team management: obstetricians, psychiatrists, pediatricians, the mother's primary care provider. \n\n ###",

A bond is the way the government borrows money. They sell you a bond and promise to pay you back later. During this time of enormous federal borrowing at levels that are unusual during good times, we have the backstory of bonds. Their invention was less about financial innovation and more about appeasing a mob. Here's NPR's Stacey Vanek Smith of the Planet Money Indicator podcast. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Government bonds work like this. You buy, let's say, a hundred dollars' worth of 30-year Treasury bonds. The government takes that hundred bucks and uses it to help pave a highway or contribute to someone's unemployment check or mow the White House lawn. And in exchange, you get a regular payout every year until the 30 years is up. At the current rate, you get about three bucks a year. And 30 years later, you would also get your hundred dollars back, so 190 bucks in total. It's a pretty slick system. And it all traces back to 12th-century Venice. At the time, Venice was one of the most important and powerful cities in the world, a center for innovation, culture and global trade. But Constantinople, another Middle Ages powerhouse, decided to make a move on Venice. Venice had to respond. WILLIAM GOETZMANN : The government of Venice needed to build a fleet of ships in kind of a hurry.

And when the Venetian people saw that he survived, they chased him down the street and executed him. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Oh. Venice's governing council was like, uh oh.

And governments loved them because they could raise money for big, ambitious, risky projects. WILLIAM GOETZMANN : It meant that, in some sense, cities could punch above their weight. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Spain used bonds to help fund shipping expeditions to South America. Holland used bonds to build dikes. Bonds helped western European economies grow at the speed they did and to the scale they did. In fact, says William, China, which had been leaps and bounds ahead of Europe in terms of wealth and technology, started to fall behind, partly because of the money raised through government bonds.

MARK JORDAN LEGAN : With all the recent steroid scandals in sports from high school to the pros, it was just a matter of time before someone made a documentary about it.

Entertainment Weekly finds \"Bigger, Stronger, Faster\" fascinating and the Los Angeles Times cheers, raucously funny and surprisingly insightful.

Well, it would have been the world's largest airline, but United Airlines and US Airways have thought better of joining forces.  After two months of merger talks, they are going their separate ways.  Marketplace's Amy Scott is here.  Amy, how come this merger fell apart? AMY SCOTT : Well, United Airlines has been looking for a merger partner for a long time.  The idea being that joining forces with another big carrier could help the airline cut some costs and better compete with low-cost carriers and recently, you'll recall, Delta and Northwest agreed to merge adding a pressure on United.  But merging costs a lot of money upfront that the airlines don't have right now and both United and US Airways have a lot of labor strife.  One analyst I spoke to says put together two big airlines with problems and you'll get one huge airline with problems.  He also said that there was some disagreement about who would run the new airline.  So for now, a merger is off the table. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, what is this going to mean for passengers? AMY SCOTT : Well, some analysts have said that a merger would have led to higher airfares, but everybody I talked to today says airfares are going to rise regardless, and the main reason is the cost of fuel.  British Airways just announced is second fuel surcharge increase this month.  One analyst I spoke to, Robert Mann, says consolidation could be good for consumers in that it could help keep these airlines flying. Mr. ROBERT MANN (Airline Industry Analyst) : The bad news is that fares have to rise anyway.  The good news is that if consolidation occurs and the surviving companies become more stable, there will be a system around for customers to use at those higher prices. \n\n ###",

We saw MAXjet shut down last Christmas Eve, another one called Eos stopped flying last month.  Silverjet was up against those high fuel costs and also, the credit crunch has made it difficult to get financing.  The airline is still trying to work something out with investors but right now, it's not looking very good.  I do have one bit of good news for air travelers, though, today.  They'll no longer have to pay two dollars a bag for curb service on American Airlines.  American dropped the fee to appease skycaps who said that their tips had dropped sharply when the fee was imposed.

Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : Well, you know, from the very beginning, we only had one goal, and it's a goal that Child Protective Services always has and that's to protect children.  And again, we were disappointed with the ruling as we were disappointed with the earlier court ruling, but we acted appropriately.

Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : That's something that is being discussed a great deal in all kinds of circles--legal and social services and government and otherwise--as to what effect this whole, you know, two-month long experience will have on how Child Protective Services in Texas and perhaps elsewhere, conduct investigations, how they respond to complaints. MADELEINE BRAND, host : What are some of the possible outcomes do you think? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : It's impossible to say.  I mean, again, Child Protective Services in Texas, like any CPS in any state, has to operate a great deal on judgments and a great deal on, you know, risk assessment rules and risk assessment models and in any case in which you respond to a report of possible child abuse or child neglect in a household, if you find abuse or neglect in that household a CPS investigator is trained that if one child in a household has been abused then the other children in that household may be at risk of abuse. So it may be in the best interest of everyone in the household to remove all the children. That's the model that we operated under in the YFC case.  And the court says that that model, that risk assessment decision-making, was flawed, and you can't remove all the children in a given household just because you believe one or more of them have been abused or neglected, and so that's something that is causing a great deal of interest in social service circles.

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : Judge Amy Berman Jackson found that Paul Manafort lied about a payment to a law firm that apparently did some work for him, about some other unrelated criminal investigation, and then here's the most important thing. Judge Jackson found Manafort lied about the nature of his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence. They had meetings and conversations throughout the campaign, and even after the campaign, after the inauguration and into 2018 that prosecutors say were at the heart of this investigation into Russian election interference and whether any Americans helped. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Wow. So this is Paul Manafort's conversations with a guy linked to Russian intelligence. I'm just making sure I understand this. And you're saying that Paul Manafort lied about talking with this person throughout the presidential campaign, where Manafort was campaign chairman for President Trump for a while, and even continued after the election for a good while. So are we able to learn anything from - anything true from knowing which lies he told? CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : Well, you know, a lot of the proceedings in this matter have been sealed. We're eventually getting transcripts, which have a lot of blacked-out versions or redactions. We do know that prosecutors think that Manafort passed some kind of polling data to this person the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence, that they had a meeting in August 2016 at the heart of the campaign. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : And we also know this, Steve - that Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort's right-hand man and deputy, has been cooperating for a lot longer than Paul Manafort. Prosecutors are taking this information from Richard Gates, who also was around the campaign, the inauguration and the Trump White House, and contrasting it with what Manafort has told them to help determine that Manafort has lied about matters central to this investigation into what happened with the Russians and Americans in 2016. \n\n ###",

And he was remembering how he and his sister used to go to the shooting range together. PATRICK PETTY : That's something that my sister and I bonded over and something that we both enjoyed doing. And I can remember seeing the smile on her face the first time she went shooting and the first time she was learning. She really enjoyed it. DAVID GREENE, HOST : And so you know, I asked Patrick if his views have changed about guns since his sister was killed in a shooting, and he said no. He believes in the Second Amendment as strongly as ever, including the right to own assault weapons like the one that was used in the shooting where his sister was killed. But he said he has become a little more open to listening to people on the other side of the gun debate, is more open to conversation, which was interesting. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. David, there's a bit of news I want to ask about.

DAVID GREENE, HOST : So you started covering the tragedy in Parkland, I mean, on our air, actually, literally as it was unfolding a year ago. Right?

And I think that's the only way you can describe it. And that's why I think a year later, today, is so impossibly hard for people that live here and have lived through this, not just through that day but for an entire year of aftermath after this. CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : And that's why I think a lot of - a lot of families don't want to send their children to school today. A lot of people I've talked to are spending this day really hunkering down, you know, almost treating it like it's a hurricane day, which sounds strange - but just being together in your home with your family, no agenda. \n\n ###",

And here, a year later, I mean, it's just quieter activism. So it's not going to be going at the same rate it was when we had the big march in D.C.

It's not about just having them for sport or for fun. It's the Second Amendment was written for us, the citizens, to protect ourselves against a tyrannical government. That may not happen for 50, hundred, even a thousand years. But the moment you take that right away, you open the door for it to happen. You make it easier for it to happen. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Now, to fight a tyrannical government, Patrick said citizens should have the right to powerful weapons, even assault weapons like the one that killed his sister. Although recently, he and his dad went to Florida's state capital to show their support for a new law that included something he didn't like. It bars anyone under 21 from owning an assault weapon. The law had been 18. I asked him if he would have compromised on that before the mass shooting. PATRICK PETTY : No, I wouldn't have. I've always been into politics, and that's always been something that I've loved. I've always loved learning about the issues and learning information on them. And before the shooting, I really loved learning as much information about a topic so that I could be the one that was right. Since the - last February, my - my views haven't really changed. But my perspective has changed a little bit. PATRICK PETTY : And now I'm focused on understanding people, why they think the way that they do, why a certain issue - whatever that might be, whether it's guns or school safety - why they take that position, why they care about that so much, and then finding the common ground and building - really building a relationship on what we both agree on first so that when it comes to a political hot topic - whether it's gun control, abortion, any of these big hot topics - we have that sort of bond between us already that makes us respect each other for just being humans and being people together.

Authorities have arrested Maria Ressa. She's co-founder of an independent news site called Rappler. It's a startup. It has reported critically on the family activities of President Rodrigo Duterte.

JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE : ...Because they linked him to illegal activities in an article that was published seven years ago and republished five years ago. And the businessman said he was very grateful to the justice department for bringing the case. But according to Rappler, the contents of that report were published earlier in another newspaper. But he only went after Ressa's website Rappler. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. So five years ago, seven years ago, Duterte wasn't even president. And yet now the case is brought by Duterte's government. Are there people who are responding by saying that this is not really what the government's concern is about? JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE : Well, that's exactly right. In fact, they're saying what it's really about and what it smacks of is silencing the critics of President Duterte. The Committee to Protect Journalists, Amnesty International all moved in to say just that. The National Union of Journalists in the Philippines calls it persecution - this is a quote - \"persecution by a bully government.\" So you get a sense where the lines are drawn here. Now Maria Ressa is a - is globally recognized. She's among the journalists who Time magazine named person of the year. And while this was the first time she was arrested, it was the sixth time Ressa has had to post bail. There are several government agencies, including the tax department, that have gone after her. Now, Ressa told me that the case has wide implications and that the message the government is trying to send couldn't be clearer. Here she is. MARIA RESSA : Be quiet or you're next. You cannot be silent. Do not be silent because the rule of law is the only thing that keeps a democracy together. Press freedom is not just about journalists. Press freedom is the foundation of all the rights of all Filipinos to the truth. We're in a battle for the truth. And the first casualty is a number of people killed in the drug war.

He's threatened to pull the license of other mainstream media. But, you know, it's important to remember to see what's happening in the Philippines as part of a larger trend.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : David, let's start with you. By declaring a national emergency, what specific authorities does that give the president? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : It gives him potentially many authorities. There are hundreds of statutes that Congress has been approving since the time of George Washington that lie dormant most of the time. They are only activated when the president declares a national emergency. By law, he has to cite which specific statutes he's going to be using. But when he does use these statutes, there's really no definition that Congress has ever given for what constitutes a national emergency. So it'd be hard to challenge him on the grounds that, no, this doesn't fall within what we consider a national emergency. Congress does have ways to block a national emergency. Both chambers would have to vote to do that and then send that to the president for him to sign. And if he doesn't, they'd have to override a veto from him. So really this sort of opens the way for him to tap those powers and try to get the money that Congress refused to give him in this bill that he is expected to sign today. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So, Sue, how is Congress reacting to this? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Well, as Steve noted, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports it, which came as some surprise because we do know from our own reporting that he had expressed private concerns to the White House about this course of action. Not all Republicans are onboard. Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, have said publicly they do not support the president going in this path.

The first option is the law that gives the power the president to do this gives Congress the power to take it away. They have the authority to pass resolutions of disapproval that would essentially block the president. The political reality is you would need a veto-proof majority in both chambers to do that, and they probably don't have that because Republicans control the Senate. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : They also can challenge it in the courts. And Democrats are saying they are prepared to do that. How they challenge it goes to what exactly the president does. But remember, there's a constitutional challenge in question here. The Constitution is very clear in Article I that Congress gets to decide how money is appropriated, and the president is challenging what that means. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : But, David, where is the money going to come from? I mean, the White House has suggested that there will be all kinds of pots of money that the national emergency will give the president access to. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : Right. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What pots of money? \n\n ###",

These pots of money are all funding that Congress has already approved for other purposes. And mostly they seem to be associated with the Department of Defense, which gets about two-thirds of the money that Congress approves each year. We don't have the specifics yet from the White House, but it appears that Trump is going to try to raid other accounts to add more than $6 billion to the $1.375 billion that Congress has approved for a border barrier for a total of $8 billion. That's a lot more than the $5.7 billion he'd been seeking. And most of that money - $3 1/2 billion - is expected to come from the Pentagon's military construction budget. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : And that's likely to anger a lot of defense hawks on both sides of the aisle because that money was all meant to be spent improving military bases. There's also about $2 1/2 billion in the Defense Department's drug interdiction program that Trump is expected to tap, as well as another $600 million from Treasury's drug forfeiture fund. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wait a minute. So the president has been expressing concern about drug trafficking across the border, and he's going to take away drug trafficking interdiction money in order to build the wall. Is that correct? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : That's right. And I guess he would argue that while this is all about stopping drugs, and that's what the military money was meant for, that's what I'm going to do with it too. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Which is just fascinating - because if if that money were available, they would have appropriated it that way in the first place because, at its core, this is all a spending debate. This is all about creating the budget, as is Congress's writ to do. And if that money had been available, they would have done it the first time. \n\n ###",

And they shortchanged the president on what he wanted. But it was saying basically Congress judges that this is as much money as you should get for this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So there are national emergencies - I mean, it's nothing new, right? And there are dozens that are currently active - is that right, David? What are these? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : There are dozens that are active. But they're mainly actions that are freezing the assets of foreigners in U.S. banks - that kind of thing. President Trump has actually done a couple of those things. This is very unusual that a president would declare a national emergency to get money that Congress would not give him, effectively making it an end run around Congress. In fact, it's hard to find any other president who's ever done this. So we're in uncharted waters right now. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sue, any inclination as to what happens, like, over the next hours and days? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Well, as David said, we really are looking for where exactly the president's going to draw all this money from. Remember. We knew the White House was thinking about this. So Democrats have also been prepared for this. In the response to the State of the Union, one of their responses - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former member of Congress, cited this national emergency threat and said if the president were to go forward on this, Democrats were prepared, and he would file action in court the day the president signs the declaration. So we're looking for the specifics on it and then who in the Democratic Party are going to bring these suits. \n\n ###",

NPR's Susan Davis and David Welna. Thanks so much, you guys. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : You're welcome. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Cities submitted proposals about all the amazing things they could offer Amazon. And in turn, the corporation promised a lot of jobs and an economic boost. After a long highly publicized search, New York was selected as one of two locations, along with Alexandria outside of Washington, D.C. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was delighted. BILL DE BLASIO : This was unprecedented. And Amazon had a national competition because they had something worth competing for. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : But just three months later, that relationship has come to an end because Amazon announced yesterday that it is canceling the plans for its New York City campus.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So Amazon made a huge deal about the search for these locations and the announcement. You'd think they would have thought through all the potential pitfalls, right? What happened in New York? ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : I think this really was quite the jarring development for everybody involved. I mean, we were hearing from some local groups who were meeting with Amazon officials as early as Thursday morning. And nobody in those meetings seemed to know that this was coming. The hugest sticking point in all of this for the critics was the fact that the city and the state were offering a really large subsidy package to Amazon - tax breaks of almost $3 billion. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : Add to that the upset city council. This was really big. Amazon had picked an approval process that involved the mayor and the governor but gave city council no real power over the deal - upset city council. \n\n ###",

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : And also in a way, this was a reflection of the rise of the progressive left. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had been an outspoken critic, and her district is near the area where Amazon wanted to build the new HQ. And there's something to be said about New York groups really knowing how to mobilize. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : In this case, housing groups, union groups, all kinds of groups came together at those city council hearings where Amazon was just pummeled. And the supporters had their arguments too. A potential of 25,000 well-paying jobs is nothing to sneeze at - plus in the area of Queens that doesn't really have a tech presence. But supporters weren't as visible as the activists. And really in New York, this played out more like a political fight than a business negotiation. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So can I ask about the argument of AOC? It was just - we don't think Amazon is going to give enough back to our local community. It's not worth it - the tax breaks basically.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : Right. So they're saying they can't really do a project in a place where local elected officials don't want to work with them. And they will not be looking for a replacement location, although certainly other cities are probably calling them now. We saw Chicago officials publicly saying they'd welcome a reconsideration from Amazon. And even back in New York, while Amazon critics celebrated last night, many people were torn about how this played out. Maybe they didn't love the financials of the deal, but they didn't want Amazon to just walk away. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE : We spoke to Chris Hanway, executive director of a Queens-based nonprofit Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement. And he said he'd kept his mind open about the HQ deal and was sad about the lost job opportunities for Queens residents. But he also said Amazon hasn't been fully forthcoming with answers to some of the questions the local groups had. CHRISTOPHER HANWAY : I think this is a real lesson for everybody who - whether you're on the organizing side or you're on the corporate side - about the importance of communication. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Communication - so, Alina, just briefly, this is a model for economic development. A lot of cities luring businesses with tax breaks. Is this going to change anything to that model? \n\n ###",
