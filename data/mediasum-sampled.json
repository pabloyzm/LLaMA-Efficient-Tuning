This edition is billed as \"The Complete Bible.\" It doesn't have one person reading the gospels. It features nearly 400 African-American artists, actors and ministers, plus sound effects. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just listen to Blair Underwood's rendition of Jesus on the cross. Mr. BLAIR UNDERWOOD (Actor) : (As Jesus) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, we've got two people affiliated with the project with us today. Kyle Bowser, he co-produced \"The Bible Experience\" and actress Wendy Raquel Robinson, one of the actors in \"The Bible Experience,\" and she also stars in the CW series, \"The Game.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi folks, how are you doing? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Great. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Great. How are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Now, Kyle, how did this project come about? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Hmm. A couple of winters ago, while Christmas shopping, I purchased an audio bible and hoped that I would finally get through the Bible by listening to it in my car. And I had failed to read the Bible as I'd promised. And after listening to a couple of disks, I was very disappointed. It just didn't really resonate with me. There was a lack of real production value. And the idea struck that perhaps we should try to do this ourselves and bring the Hollywood experience that we have to the process. And I think we have accomplished that goal. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Were you ever afraid of crossing a line and saying, okay, we're going to make this too Hollywood - the Bible is going too Hollywood? And I'm thinking of all the criticism of Mel Gibson's movie, \"The Passion of the Christ.\" Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : No, that thought never really occurred to me. I think the gospel is applicable wherever you go including Hollywood. If anything, I was a little concerned about the idea of profiting from the Bible. But after consulting with some theologians and my grandmother, I got over that quickly. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Wendy - now, you were the voice of an angel in the book of Revelations. Let's take a listen to that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Unidentified Man: A second angel followed and said, Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : (As Angel) Fallen. Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : That (unintelligible). FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What did you - yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So - I mean, it's not bad to be an angel. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : No. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Other than that, what made you want to do this? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : You know, it's amazing. I feel like I got kind of bombarded the project. I knew Robi Reed who was also the casting director, and (unintelligible) who was actually working on it. And one day, I happened to be there and I saw a demo of what they were doing. And I said, hands down. How can I be a part of this? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : So I just pretty much put myself into it because I was just so drawn by the emotion, by - I mean, of course, you know, any time you're doing something that's related to the Gospel and to the Bible, you know - immediately I was drawn to that. But it was just so different from any project that I've ever been attached to or had even, you know, been around. So I was just - I basically - I bombarded the project myself. \n\n ###",

Obviously, people are getting very much into the iPod\u2026 Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Mm-hmm. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \u2026and podcasting, listening to this-that and the other in your car. Do you think that this opens up other people to the - I mean, we just did a series on religion not too long ago. Certainly, not every one is Christian. Not every black person is Christian, but there is\u2026 Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \u2026plenty. Do you think this opens up new experiences for people who are plugging in or plugged into Christianity? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Oh, I think it definitely does because not only is it the actual goal in its presentation, but it is the, you know, it's the true word of God, too. So you're getting both in one, you know? It's really difficult for me to listen to books on tape or, you know, just basically even - I don't care if these just sermons or anything like that. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : But with this, you know, you'd get the fullness of it, you know? You get the sound effects; you get the emotions; you get the authentic word of God, you know? And it's really easy listening to, and before you know it, you'd do the entire New Testament, you know - before you know it, so it's awesome. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Kyle, now, the first Bible experience was the New Testament. It won 2007 audio book of the year - that's high praise. What kind of fan mail have you gotten that really warms your heart? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Well, I'm glad you ask that question because so often, people ask about the success of the project and it counts the question in a monetary context. I think the only way to really measure the success of \"The Bible Experience\" is to look at the fan mail, to look at the e-mails and the cards and the letters and the personal testimony that we hear. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : I have a cousin who, three months ago, was struck by a car while riding his bike. And he's been laying paralyzed for the last three months. And on his second day in the hospital, he whispered in his wife's ear, asking for her to bring a copy of \"The Bible Experience\" to his room. That's the kind of evidence of the success of \"The Bible Experience.\" It speaks to your soul. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : And for me, as a Christian and many others, as Wendy said, it is the definitive word of God. But for others, it's enjoyable because it is so dramatic. It is so emotionally powerful. You know, it's historically accurate whether or not you apply the faith analysis to the word. So much of what's written in the Bible has been proven to be historically accurate and we capture all of that so wonderfully. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Wendy, what's it like for you to be a part of this ensemble? It's one of the largest ensemble cast of black actors, I guess you could say. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : It's bigger than \"Roots.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It is. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : No. Oh, it is. I feel like it's a part of history. I'm sorry; I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : No, that's - it's true. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : But I'm honored, you know? I mean, Blair Underwood, Forest Whitaker, you know, Angela Bassett. So, so many of the celebrities that I admire and look up to were a part of this. But that's not why I was drawn to it, but it just takes it to a whole another level for me on so many different levels. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : And to see these other artists, you know, praising God through their work, you know. It's an anointed piece, you know, because you can't half-step with God. You know what I mean? You have to really drink it, so when they did the interpretations in the studio and if you even get a chance to see the video portion of it, it's amazing. I mean, it just brings you to tears emotionally. And just, you know, really reliving those moments, you can actually see these characters within the Bible come to life. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Kyle, very quickly - I mean, super quick. Any future plans? It's - you kind of gone to both testaments, what have you got left? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Well, we - meaning me and my partners - are all thinking about different ways that we can continue to share this wonderful experience in whatever medium is available - visually, through audio product, through all of the distribution technologies that are available. So please, stay tuned for that. \n\n ###",

OK, so now imagine it's your first election. We talked to a few young voters making their choices for the very first time in a general election. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : So my name's Ashanti Martinez (ph). I'm 20 years old. I'm from Prince George's County, Md., and I'm voting for Hillary Clinton. LAUREN SMITH : Hi, I'm Lauren Smith. I'm 20 years old and I'm voting for Trump. GENESIS LARIN : My name is Genesis Larin. I'm from Houston, Texas. And I'd say I'm a conflicted voter but leaning towards Hillary Clinton. NICK TOMCHIK : My name is Nicholas Tomchik (ph). I'm from Winslow, Maine. I'm 20 years old, and I'm voting for Gary Johnson. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right, so I want to learn more about how each of you came to your decision. So I'm going to start with you, Lauren. You're voting for Donald Trump. Did you support him in the Republican primary? LAUREN SMITH : No, I actually supported Ted Cruz. And, you know, I have to say, there's no question that this election cycle has been unbelievable. So I'm voting for Trump because not only am I a Republican but he has a pro-life agenda. He's for a limited government, and that's what I support. Am I happy with him? No, absolutely not. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Nick, you've decided to support the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. How come? Why not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Why go with a third-party option? NICK TOMCHIK : All my life, I've gone against the status quo. I'm a Libertarian myself. I definitely believe in what Gary Johnson has to offer, his policies - minimizing the role of government, pro-choice. You know, we've got to cut the wasteful spending. We've got to offer an alternative. And especially with this election being so, you know, as Lauren said, you know, pretty much crazy, we've got to have another choice. And he brings that to America. And I really like that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Genesis, you said you're leaning reluctantly towards Hillary Clinton. But I understand that's a big deal because you're a registered Republican. GENESIS LARIN : I actually did not register with, like, a specific party affiliation. But yes, I am, I guess, leaning towards Hillary Clinton just because I'm very disappointed in the candidates that I have to choose from. But I just can't support what Donald Trump has said, even though I did vote Republican for the primaries. However, I did vote for Marco Rubio. I feel like this election, at least for me, has come down to voting against someone instead of a vote for someone that actually aligns with a lot of, like, my views for certain issues. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And you haven't found that in either of the major party candidates? GENESIS LARIN : It was mentioned before that Hillary Clinton, her experience as far as policies - and I do take into account her experience. And I guess I feel comfortable because she has been around. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What do you not like about her? What gives you pause about her? GENESIS LARIN : Part of it is her scandals. But it's also she has, you know, kind of switched sides on some of the policies. So if anything, I was kind of confused on, like, exactly where she stands because it just comes off as she's saying certain sides just to get a vote. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Ashanti, what do you think when you hear that? I mean, you're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, but she's had kind of a tough time making inroads with people your age. What are the top issues for you? ASHANTI MARTINEZ : One of them would be definitely college affordability, making sure that no matter where you are on the income spectrum in this country that you can go to college debt-free or that you can leave college debt-free. The next issue for me is health care, making sure that folks are able to have quality health care in this country. And then I guess the next issue for me that really comes home is criminal justice reform. Too many people of black and brown skin color, that look like me, go to jail, oftentimes, for sentences and things that they shouldn't have. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I want to ask you, Lauren - you heard Genesis say that she identifies as a Republican. She voted for Marco Rubio in the primary, but she's considering voting for Hillary Clinton. What do you say to her? LAUREN SMITH : I think as a Republican, I don't understand how you could support Hillary Clinton. And I understand many of what Trump has said is, quite frankly, deplorable. And I completely get that. However, if you're a Republican, if you believe in limited government, if you're pro-life, vote for Donald Trump. And again, that's the issues that I fully support and that I want to see happen in America. I want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. So Genesis, what I would say to you is, what issues are holding you back? And why can't you vote for Donald Trump, if I can ask you that... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sure. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Genesis, you want to answer? GENESIS LARIN : Yeah. So I'm actually pro-choice. I do... LAUREN SMITH : OK. GENESIS LARIN : ...Believe that climate change is something that we need to address. That being said, I've never particularly, I guess, been completely on board with bigger government. And that's something that I think is what makes me more conservative, even though I guess I'm more left-leaning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You're that coveted independent, Genesis, who everyone wants. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You're that coveted middle-of-the-road voter. GENESIS LARIN : (Laughter) Yeah. And I feel - the way I approached the selection wasn't blue or red or green, even. It was I wanted to find a candidate that I think was most representative of my view and whose competency in doing this, at being president, I would feel comfortable voting for. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Nick, let me ask you this - are you feeling enthusiastic about your choice? Like, are you - how do you feel about supporting Gary Johnson? NICK TOMCHIK : Yeah. I honestly am very enthusiastic about supporting him. That's the thing that I think makes me different and also maybe the Libertarians or the independents that are, you know, supporting Gary Johnson. They're actually voting for someone because they really like his policies. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And you don't buy the argument that a vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, on the other side - the Green Party, is a de facto vote for the other party, be it right or left? NICK TOMCHIK : Not at all. I definitely think that that plays into the fear-mongering because from a lot of people I hear, they want to vote for Gary but they're - you know, they tell me that argument. And essentially, if all the people who, you know, actually voted third party - said that they're not going to vote for the third party because of that voted third party, then, you know, Gary Johnson has a huge chance of winning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Lauren, your candidate, Donald Trump, has had a hard time getting the kind of support from women voters that he needs to put him in good standing when November 8 rolls around. Why do you think that is, especially when you talk to your peers, other young women? I mean, how much of it - of the reluctance has to do with the kind of rhetoric we've heard from him, those recent comments on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape? Is that coming up in conversations? LAUREN SMITH : You know, a lot of my peers, especially the women, do support Donald Trump. I don't condone sexual assault. I mean, that's utterly ridiculous. But we have to remember that was a long time ago. I mean, 2005 happened almost 11 years ago. So as far as Donald Trump's comment on women go - does it bother me? It does in some ways, but I'm choosing to look at the bigger picture. And I'm choosing to look at America as a whole instead of trying to, you know, just go and tear Trump to shreds over what he said in the past. So the women that I have spoken to, especially the the Women for Trump here in Virginia, of course they support him. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : If I can chime in, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Go for it, Ashanti. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : For me - right? - I've talked to a lot of women. I'm around women often. And these Trump allegations about him sexually assaulting women and bragging about it is deplorable. And it's something that is definitely on people's minds, especially around my age group. But this isn't the first instance, right? We look at the comments that he had with former Miss America and former Miss Universe contestants. We look at the comments that he had about contributors on different networks. We look at the comments that he's had of people on his own show, on \"The Apprentice,\" and how he's treated women throughout his career, whether it be in real estate or whether it be on television. So to me, to say that these things don't matter is wrong. This man has so many different things that don't speak to our country as being inclusive and as progressive as we should be. And I think that's why he's not qualified. LAUREN SMITH : Well, I certainly understand that position. But I also have to say I don't want Hillary Clinton as president. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is your first time voting in a presidential election. So how you feeling? I mean, what are the conversations that you're having at home or with your friends? Are people animated to get out and vote? Is there a sense of apathy? I'm going to start with Lauren. What are people talking about in your circles? LAUREN SMITH : There's one side, the 50 percent - they're very apathetic. They don't want to get out and vote. You know, I've lost friends because of the way I'm voting. And, in some ways, I understand that. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : In the nation's capital, a killer is on the loose. It's been operating in America for decades now. We're talking about AIDS. Tomorrow is World AIDS Day. Today, we'll discuss staggering new information on how prevalent AIDS is in Washington D.C., particularly among African-Americans. Overall, the rate of AIDS cases in Washington D.C. is about 10 times higher than in the United States. Dr. Shannon Hader is the director of the D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration. Welcome. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, these are really some chocking numbers. Sixty percent of the city's residents are African-American, but 81 percent of new HIV cases in the city are among African-Americans. How many people are we really talking about? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, you know, we have about 12,500 people in the district right now living with HIV and AIDS, but about 80 percent of those are mainly African-American communities. So, we're talking a high number of people, not just a hundred or two hundred, but thousands. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about the trend lines? Are you seeing these number of new infections increase? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, you know, certainly over the United States, the trend over the last decade has been increasing racial disparities and the HIV epidemic with more African-Americans affected. Here in the district, we have really good data for the last 2001 through 2006, and what we see is that we're not gaining much ground at this point in terms of reducing infections, although we seem to be holding a little bit even. And - but I think particularly among the women, the rates among women have been increasing over the last five or six years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What percentage of women in the D.C. area are African-American who were infected? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Mm-hmm. Among all the women that we know are infected with HIV in the district, about 90 percent of them are African-American. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : With these numbers, with the racial disparities, what is being done? What are the approaches that you and other government, public health officials, nonprofits are taking to really start addressing this? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, I think what we're doing and what we need to continue to do is an attack on all fronts. First step is, information is power. These data, these hard facts give us a good picture for everyone at the individual level, at the community level, at the government level, at the policy level, to really wake up if they haven't and see the nature of the epidemic we're dealing with. Second, it's about services and it's about taking action, both to protect yourself and protect others. We are ramping what was already sort of a groundbreaking HIV policy in the district, which is this know your status, HIV tests should be just the same as knowing about your other routine health indicators. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : So, our goal is, by 2009, when you go to an emergency department, they should routinely offer you an HIV test. When you show up at your primary care doctor's office, you should get, just like you get the rest of the tests for your annual physical - you get your BMI for obesity, you get a blood pressure for hypertension, you get your blood sugar for diabetes - you should be getting your HIV status as well, without having to sort of beg for it or ask specifically. This has to be part and parcel about how we all approach our general health going forward. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There have been celebrity campaigns that say things like, it's good know, know your status, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but people are afraid. All of us have fears and some people may not want to know. What's the sense that you get of that? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, I think that that issue of stigma, fear, and silence is huge. And absolutely, that impacts people searching their test results, but it also impacts people taking preventive measures and taking care of measures to keep their health strong. I've been incredibly motivated by Mayor Fenty's leadership in saying, I'm making HIV/AIDS our number one health priority here in the district. And, in large part, a lot of that has to do with saying, come on, let's come together, let's break the stigma, break the fear, break the silence. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Who's really responsible for this - responsible may be the wrong word, but, I mean, Washington D.C. is a very interesting case of the overlap of the federal government and the local government. So, what responsibilities does it seem as if each has in dealing with this issue? Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Well, you know what, we're all responsible and we have to use all the resources that are out there, whether they're district or federal, to get to the next level of our HIV response. Certainly, one of the specific relationship issues that's come out in D.C. has been this issue of Congress limiting our ability to spend our own district tax money on our own district programs and specifically, I'm talking about needle exchange programs. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Certainly, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has been working as well as Mayor Fenty has been working to convince Congress to remove that restriction on our funds, and I'm confident that that's going to happen this year. So, that's something that's specific to the district that other jurisdictions don't have to deal with. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How much of needle exchange programs become more popular? They were extremely controversial when they were first proposed and first implemented. Dr. SHANNON HADER (Director, D.C. HIV/AIDS Administration) : Mm-hmm. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Is this now a fairly accepted form of a public health intervention? \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Before the break, we heard from a mother with AIDS. She has been getting great support from her family. But that is not always the case. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Dorothy Holmes is a psychologist in Miami. She has been working with people infected with HIV and their families for several years now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hello. Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Hello. How are you doing today? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I am doing great. So, we just heard from Carla. She waited to tell her kids and family about her illness. So let's start off with disclosure. When is the right time to really reveal the illness to others if you have HIV or AIDS? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Well, disclosure is based on a needed-to-know, and that need to know starts with, of course, the individual's sexual partner. However, when it comes to disclosing some of your status to your children, there's no black and white answer or yes or no in terms of when to or when not to disclose. It depends on several factors, which include - some of these factors include the age of the child, child's emotional maturity, the child's intellectual and the child's intellectual functioning. And - but before disclosure takes place, my recommendation is that the infected person, of course, meets with a mental health professional who has experience in this particular field. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So when you, as a psychologist, deal with individuals who have a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS, what are some of the most common questions that come up in your sessions? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Disclosure is typically the first issue. Do I need to tell my children? Is, (unintelligible) the children or younger than 15 or 14, parents are probably concerned about their longevity in terms of whether they'll be, whether or not they will be available or be around to see their children grow up, finish high school, become functional adults themselves. So they really want to know when and how do I let my children know, or if I let - should I let my children know. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Do you ever see people who react in ways that are completely unhealthy? Drug abuse or recklessness or acting out with anger? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Yes, in terms of not disclosing their status to\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, after they have had\u2026 Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : \u2026the partner. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : After they've had a diagnosis. Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : After they've had a diagnosis, yes. Unfortunately, unfortunately, that is the case for some people. Because of their anger and rage, they do act out inappropriately and not disclose their status to a sexual partner. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now\u2026 Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : And that causes the incidents to - of HIV/AIDS to increase. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah. I was just going to ask you about that because we heard earlier in the show how rampant AIDS has become among African-Americans in the Washington, D.C. area particularly, but obviously, there are plenty of places where there's just a huge increase. And when you think about this idea of telling someone, there have been all these campaigns to ask people to open up. But do you think that's really working? Dr. DOROTHY HOLMES (Psychologist; National President, Association of Black Psychologists) : Well, again, the issue of social stigma, shame, guilt, lack of education and knowledge are some of the factors that prevent individuals from disclosing their status. One of the things that must be readdressed was the need for information and education and that's our first line of defense. Once we educate ourselves, then we're able to protect ourselves. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Carla Bailey has been living with AIDS for 13 years. There are people who've been living with AIDS for over two decades.

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : The gloves came off at the GOP debate last night. The Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary are less than six weeks away; Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney squared off with personal attacks from the very start. Mr. RUDY GIULIANI (Republican, New York) : If you're going to take this holier-than-thou attitude, that your whole approach to immigration was so\u2026 Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : I'm sorry, immigration is not holier than thou, Mayor. It's the law. Mr. RUDY GIULIANI (Republican, New York) : If you're going to take this holier than thou attitude that you are perfect on immigration\u2026 Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : I'm not perfect. Mr. RUDY GIULIANI (Republican, New York) : \u2026 it just happens you have a special immigration problem that nobody else here has. You were employing illegal immigrants\u2026 Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : You know, what\u2026 Mr. RUDY GIULIANI (Republican, New York) : That is a pretty serious thing. They were under your nose. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : CNN and YouTube co-hosted the event in St. Petersburg, Florida. The candidates took questions from the public submitted through the video-sharing Web site. Most of them were basic webcam stand-ups, but there were a few colorful productions. One included a man eating an ear of corn; another a cartoon of Vice President Dick Cheney holding a rifle. Mr. NICK ANDERSON : Yeah. Will you grant your vice president as much power and influence as I've had, and remember before you answer, I'am watching you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So who got the upper hand? We've got two folks to help us find out. Political scientist Mark Sawyer - he's director of the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics at UCLA; and James Taylor - he's an associate professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. Welcome. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : Hello, Farai. Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : Hello. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, I guess, James, I'll start with you. Was there a clear winner last night? Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : I wouldn't say there was a clear winner, but I thought Mike Huckabee did well on a number of questions he came across, I think, as an attractive candidate, as someone who is quick making populous appeals such as eliminating the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security. And he talked about, for example, eliminating the National Income Tax and coming up with a fair tax and, so I thought he did a good job in using his sense of humor, being quick on the question of what would Jesus do on the death penalty. But I thought that was somewhat of an evasion to the extent that he never answered the question about what Jesus would do on the death penalty. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It sounds like you saw some threads of populism in what he was saying. Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : Absolutely. I thought he, as well as Ron Paul, as well as those who talked about eliminating the various federal programs trying to make different sorts of a populist appeals, and Ron Paul clearly comes across best in that area. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And, Mark, immigration - it was just lit on fire last night. You had that exchange between Romney and Giuliani that set the tone for other exchanges. What was the top issue for you? Was it immigration? And if so, how did that play out? Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : Yeah. I mean, I would characterize the debate as gods, guns, gays and illegals with illegals leading the way and what really touched off was the idea that they really see immigration as an issue of sort of the criminality with - there being a really stark difference between the people who've been governors and mayors who've had to take a sort of practical view about the issue, understanding that the people are there. They need to have certain kinds of policies to sort of deal with their existence being in sharp contrast to those who haven't had to deal with that. \n\n ###",

And that seems to be the sort of Romney playbook, which is sort of repositioned himself on a range of different issues quite differently than the way he addressed them in much more sort of practical terms as the governor of Massachusetts. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : James, there were a couple of questions that came from African-Americans last night. The first one dealt with black on black crime. Let's take a listen. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Unidentified Man #1: Hi. This is me and my son, Prentice(ph). We're from Atlanta. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Unidentified Man #2: I want to ask you guys a question. I noticed you spend billions of dollars on the war in Iraq every year, but what about the war going on in your own country, black on black crime? Two hundred to 400 black men die yearly in one city alone. What are you going to do about that war? It feels like the Taliban's right outside. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And here's Mitt Romney's response. Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : About the war in the inner city? Number one is to get more moms and dads. That's number one. And thank heavens Bill Cosby said it like it was; that's where the root of crime starts. Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : Number two, we've got to have better education in our schools. I think that the civil rights issue of our time is the failure of inner city schools to prepare kids in the inner city for the jobs of tomorrow. Mr. MITT ROMNEY (Republican, Massachusetts) : And number three, of course, you have to do a better job with our policing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, James, is that an answer that you think really gave some substance? Who else put anything on the table during the discussion of that issue? Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : Yeah, I thought it was, again, somewhat of an evasion because in terms of, you know, talking about education and family structures, in addition to many other issues that these candidates neglected, no one really talked specifically about, you know, the fact that, you know, in America, 27,000 African-American young men have died over the past five years through gun violence and a hundred thousand have been wounded and maimed in America. Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : This is not Baghdad; this is not Abu, this is not, you know, the Sunni triangle. This is the United States of America, and we've had - African-American young men are actually safer in Baghdad at this point than they are in any of the major cities in the United States. Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : And so in addition to all of these issues that these candidates neglected, none of them talked about job creation. None of them talked about, you know, the trade and balance with China and other countries around the world that we have imbalances with that are germane of World Trade Organization, you know, agreements that definitely undermined the ability of semi-skilled sort of individuals to be able to find work in the United States. Professor JAMES TAYLOR (Politics, University of San Francisco) : And employment rates are extremely high. This came across - in the past presidential election I thought John Kerry did a good job in highlighting the point that African-American men in New York - the majority of them were unemployed where these kinds of issues are hardly being discussed today, but in city throughout city in America, with the exception, ironically, of Los Angeles right now, violences is on the uprise. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Mark, let me take you to another question from an African-American questioner. He basically just asks why don't black votes for Republicans, given their social conservatism. Let's listen to part of Giuliani's answer. Mr. RUDY GIULIANI (Republican, New York) : So there are many, many issues on which we can reach out. I found that one of the best was moving people off welfare. I moved 640,000 people off welfare, most of them to jobs. I changed the welfare agency into a job agency, and all of a sudden, I had people that had a future, people that had great hope in life. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How solid do you think was that response and also given that now there are some questions about what is actually happening to some of the people who left the roles(ph)? Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : Yeah, it was a very weak response. I mean, the sort of Giuliani if you go on and listen to his argument was somewhat of African-Americans have a false consciousness. They're really Republicans; we just don't know it. And it seems to talk down and really not address the sort of issue, the historical issues that the Republican Party has had, which has been sort of running against using the image of African-Americans as a sort of scapegoat to whip up white voters. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : You know, that began with a southern strategy and a range of other things. Giuliani was roundly hated by African-American voters - most of the people he'd moved off welfare, he moved in to poverty. And, you know, the issues were sort of - and another thing that they continued to address is, is that, African-Americans are addressed through the lens of crime. Mr. MARK SAWYER (Director, Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics, University of California, Los Angeles) : And there are a lot of issues that face the community that are not related to crime, as James mentioned. The economy issues around trade; health care was not talked about at all. Those are things that are really core African-American issues and if, you know, for instance, if Romney thinks that education is a civil rights issue of our time, what is he going to do about it? There was no substance to the response. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : When you take a step back and look at how these guys are positioning themselves for the general election, there actually was a chance for them to do their own YouTube commercial and John McCain and Tom Tancredo showed themselves squaring off with Hillary Clinton. So they went for that aspect of it. Fred Thompson went for the jugular with the other candidates. Do you think that, at this point - first of all, there's a presumption that Hillary Clinton will be the person to beat. And secondly, that there should be a term from just attacking each other to moving into talking about the general election. James, how do you feel about that? Were they more focused on each other or more focused on the general election? \n\n ###",

STEVE PROFFITT : Madeleine, last week in our series \"What's the New What?\" a young woman, Alyssa Wagner, proposed that psychics are the new psychologists. She said her therapist was making her feel kind of crazy, but her psychic made her feel good. That didn't make a lot of our listeners feel good. A lot of them wrote in. MADELEINE BRAND, host : That's right. And many were outraged that we would allow someone to compare trained and licensed psychologists to unregulated psychics. STEVE PROFFITT : Others noted there are many types of therapists, and if one isn't right for you, just find another. MADELEINE BRAND, host : He's a comment from Robert Freeman(ph) of Ellensburg, Washington. \"Psychology is hard work. It's easier to have someone tell you what you want to hear.\" STEVE PROFFITT : OK. Now to the number one topic in our inbox. Madeleine, your interview yesterday with Atlanta attorney and author Barbara LeBey. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I don't think we've received this much mail ever. Anyway, Barbara LeBey told us she was a lifelong Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter who is now leaning toward voting for John McCain. STEVE PROFFITT : And she was critical of Barack Obama, calling him, among other things, a blank slate. Ms. BARBARA LEBEY : I don't want our country led by another inexperienced upstart. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Scores, scores, scores of our listeners wrote to question whether Ms. LeBey was actually ever a Democrat, and some of you wondered if she was, in fact, a Republican operative. Ms. SUSAN STURGILL : I'm Susan Sturgill (ph) from Columbus, Ohio. I really hope I'm only being paranoid, but it sounded to me like you were set up with an anti-Democratic campaign commercial. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Ms. LeBey is not a Republican plant. She is actually an aunt of one of our reporters, Laura Sydell. STEVE PROFFITT : And although we got a couple of letters agreeing with her views, we got a lot more comments taking issue with her statements. Here's one from listener Randy Hall. Mr. RANDY HALL : She cited John McCain's quote unquote \"record of reaching across the aisle,\" but must have been unaware that John McCain voted with Bush 95 percent of the time in 2007, and 100 percent of the time so far in 2008. One would think a lifelong Democrat would take a few minutes to research something as important as one's vote for president. Randy Hall, Marblehead, Massachusetts. PROFITT : Thanks to everyone who wrote in about that interview. And thanks to all of you who've written in with your tales of secret gloating in bad times. MADELEINE BRAND, host : That's right. We asked you yesterday to share those moments when in spite of high gas prices, high food prices and dropping ome values, you've had a reason to gloat. STEVE PROFFITT : We've gotten lots of great emails from Prius drivers, from bicyclists and this three-word summation from listener Mike Moore(ph). MADELEINE BRAND, host : Fixed-rate mortgage. STEVE PROFFITT : OK, that was great, but we're looking for more. Did you buy a bunch of oil company stock last year, maybe?

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : If you take a hard look at America's mortgage crisis, there seems to be some good news. Last week, mortgage rates dipped to a sixth-month low, but will that help Americans at risk of losing their homes? Will it even help the economy at large? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we've got Keith Reed, economics reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, welcome. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : How's it going? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's going great. So the numbers, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dropped a little bit. They were 6.24 percent last month. Now, to a six-month low of 6.20 percent. That doesn't sound like very much, so why is it making economists happy? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : Oh, it's making economists happy because it does reflect a little bit of what they've said that we need to see to try to bring some of the housing market back. I mean, one of the things that - one of the major factors that conspired to due to the housing market what it's been doing, is the fact that the rates have gone up. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : If you remember, much of what happened in the housing market over the last several years was due to the fact that we have rates that would have historical lows. And people began to buy homes and take out interest only or adjustable rate mortgages that were based on these very low rates. When those rates reset at higher levels, people - that's when you started to see people defaulting on their homes, and you started to see from the credit crunch some people in the mortgage market drying up. People weren't able to go out and borrow as much as they had been or they weren't able to borrow at all. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : So when you start to see some loosening in that in terms of the rates readjusting downward, then economists are going to be a little bit happy about that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : But, if you're at risk of losing your home, if you're trying to get refinancing, for example, will this save you? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : No, it won't, it likely won't. I mean - the problem with someone who's in a mortgage right now who wants to refi out of it is that in many instances, they are trying to refi out of a mortgage on a house that's basically worth more than they can - than the house can be sold for - excuse me, worth less that house can be sold for. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : For example, say you bought a house three years ago, and your interest - your adjustable rate mortgage had an initial rate that was set at, say, 4 percent for three years. Well, today, that mortgage would obviously - the rate would be much higher than that initial 4 percent. But then the other piece of it is, if the house was worth $150,000 three years ago, today it may only be worth, say, $120,000, or $110,000. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : So when you got to refinance that house, you really have no equity in it at all, and that's the problem that people are facing when they want to refi out of these mortgages. So it's not something that's really helping people that already own their homes or are already in a mortgage and want to get out of one, just because it was a bad mortgage and they can no longer afford it. What it may do is help loosen up credit for some people who want to buy - who hadn't been able to in the last four to six months. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So it should help you if you're a new homeowner or seeking to be a new homeowner? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : It could help you. I mean, provided you qualify, provided you meet all the qualifications to get a mortgage. And it's much more difficult to do that now than it was, say, a year ago. But if you do qualify, it makes a little bit easier for you, at least in terms of what you would pay on a monthly basis because the rates are lower than it had been in several months. And that's good news for people who were trying to buy now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Of course, the mortgage crisis is having a huge impact on the economy at large. Another thing that always does is shopping, because we do live in a consumer society. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : Uh-huh. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And so, the day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday, not as in Afro-pick power to the people Black Friday, but it's the day that supposedly retailers go in the black or start turning a profit. With things being a little shaky economically nowadays, some retailers started holiday promotions after Halloween. So\u2026 Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : Mm-hmm.

You saw sales, particularly online sales go up this year compared with last year, according to the initial data that came in. Still we're up 8.3 percent on Black Friday compared with last year, but that is with fewer customers coming into the stores. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : The only thing that you have to worry about is not just what happens on Black Friday because people have this idea that Black Friday is the day that it all happens. Black Friday is really the day that it kicks off. So the holiday shopping season traditionally starts on Black Friday, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that's when retailers make all their money. That is the day that it kicks off the holiday shopping season, and it needs sales to continue to be strong, at least for the next several weeks leading into Christmas shopping season. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : What happened this year, as you saw, pretty strong sales, stronger than expected sales on Black Friday because you had so many door-buster sales. Retailers were so worried about how dismal they thought it was going to be that they put everything on sale, and a lot of people came out, and they bought a lot of stuff, and they got better deals than they expected to get. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : But Saturday, it trailed off. And, you know, so they're worried about whether or not it's going to continue to be strong, given they started so early, right after Halloween, and they had so many sales on Black Friday, whether or not they can maintain the pace that they need to see a truly good holiday shopping season at this point. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : New economics experts talked about something called shopper's trading down. What does that mean? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : That means essentially that what's happening this year is that many shoppers are going to buy things that are essentially cheaper. They're looking for the low price point; they're looking for items that aren't necessarily as expensive. This is different from another phenomenon that involved shoppers, sort of mixing and matching what they do. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : For example, you may go to Target and buy house wares at a relatively inexpensive price, but then you and buy coats and bags that cost $300 or $400 at a Macy's or some other department store. Well, this year, the $400 handbag seems to be - is out, and people are looking for that mid-price point. A video game as opposed to a video game system; a DVD player as opposed to the big screen TV that everybody was buying last year. So with shoppers buying the less expensive items and everything being at a discounted rate, you can see some of the position that the retailers are finding themselves in. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Are retailers and shoppers essentially in opposition to each other, if not at war with each other? What I mean by that is, so many people are carrying big credit-card debt, and so you might think, okay, don't spend too much money. But then, retail helps drive the American economy. What are the different things that are - or what are the forces that are at play here? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : I don't think the retailers are at war with the consumer. It's not as if consumers are out there, you know, protesting or demanding that retailers lower their prices, you've just got some external forces out there. People in the United States, American consumers are just that, they are consumers. They want to buy things that makes us feel good. It's a reflection to a certain extent of your wealth or at least how wealthy you feel. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : But right now, people just don't feel as wealthy as they have over the last several years. You've got a situation where, you know, oil is very expensive, newer record, around $97 a barrel, which is just about a dollar or so off from a record for crude oil. That affects, obviously, what you pay to heat your home, and we are entering winter, although it doesn't feel like that in many parts of the country yet. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : It's going to affect the - your travel plans' going to affect how much you pay for an airline ticket to go home and see your family, or how much it takes to fill up your car to go to and from work. The housing economy, obviously, as we just discussed, is often has been for the better part of the year, people's houses are worth less, people can't go in and refinance their houses or can't borrow because the value of the house or due to Christmas that they have been over the last several years. You got\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So people\u2026 Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : \u2026you got the confluence or factors that are putting pressure on the retail environment. It's not that people don't want to buy or that they're ignoring what the retailers are doing. It's just that people are in a position that they haven't been in for the last several years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, let's take a quick look at something else affecting retail. It's a question of affinity buying. Do you, basically, vote your social conscience with your dollar? So there's a specific case every year since'96, the NAACP has put out a report on corporate retailers in black communities. Target, for the past three years, has not participated in the survey. The NAACP is bringing this up pointedly. Now, there's so much focus on stores that market themselves as good for the environment or green. Do people even look at what's good for diversity when they buy? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : I think some people do. Although I don't really know that there's any evidence that that it's enough to move the needle, and I have to admit that I haven't seen data on this. But I do think that, you know, there's always going to be some segment of the population that will be influenced in their buying decisions by - based on certain social or political concerns and that will cut across the gamut you will always have, X percentage of the population whose going to be very concerned with the environment? X percent of the population who is going to be very concerned with animal rights. X percent of the population is going to be - excuse me - very concerned with racial or community factors. And that percentage in the population, I think is relatively small. What the challenge is for the NAACP in the report that you talked about in their effort to galvanize something that will boycott will be to agitate beyond that base of consumers that's already buying with those concerns in mind and\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, let me just\u2026 Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : \u2026well, it remainsto be seen. Go ahead. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Bring up one thing. There's a blog called \"Black is Back,\" and the blogger who runs that made a point of saying online that when he was running a teen, parent and adult education program, Target with the only business that donated things consistently. If Target does have that kind of a track record - at least according to one person - very briefly, why would they avoid participating in this kind of a survey? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter, Cincinnati Enquirer) : It's hard to tell. That could be an indicator of any number of things. Target may have some issue with the criteria that the NAACP uses to come to its report card in which case it would - it might refuse to participate in the survey. Target - it's not necessarily something that smacks as something sinister or it doesn't necessarily indicate that they're not doing some of the things like giving back to communities based on race or based on any other concern. It could simply be that they disagree with whatever the criteria is that the NAACP uses. We don't know because target hasn't said why they don't participate in. So until they do open up and say we're not participating because of X or because of Y, it would be very difficult to make a determination about whether, you know, what the NAACP reports is really accurate and reflective\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Keith\u2026 \n\n ###",

The Southern Baptist Convention wraps up its annual meeting today in Indianapolis. NPR's Celeste Headlee was there. CELESTE HEADLEE : The consensus among voters at the Southern Baptist Convention is that there is no consensus. Mr. TOM PATTERSON (Southern Baptist) : It just don't seem like there's a candidate that anybody's excited about. Ms. SARAH BURKE (Southern Baptist) : I can't see that Southern Baptists are going to come out very strongly for one individual. Mr. MARCUS READING (Southern Baptist) : I get an odd sense with the SBC, it's almost like a quietness that I've not heard the excitement about the election on either side. CELESTE HEADLEE : Tom Patterson(ph), Sarah Burke(ph) and Marcus Reading(ph) are all chatting in the crowded hallways of the Indiana Convention Center. Loren Hutchinson(ph) of Kansas City doesn't think the Southern Baptist Convention will be as involved in presidential politics this year as it has been in the past. Mr. LOREN HUTCHINSON : I hope not. I think it's to our detriment. I think it's sidetracked us from our purpose on Earth. I think it's watered down the message of the Gospel. CELESTE HEADLEE : Why are the Southern Baptists so unenthused about the presidential race? Well, some, like Mike Butler (ph), just haven't made up their minds. Mr. MIKE BUTLER : It's very much a up-in-the-air thing right now, between Obama and McCain, for me. CELESTE HEADLEE : Yes, you heard right. A longtime member of the Southern Baptist Convention is struggling to choose between Barack Obama and John McCain in the presidential race - not exactly what you might expect from this conservative religious group. And Butler is not the only one. Ms. BEV OLONNO : Obama has an understanding of some things that we have totally missed. He is in touch with the whole racial issues that we can't just - like say, OK, that's going to happen by itself. CELESTE HEADLEE : Bev Olonno(ph) says there are things she likes about both candidates. That's probably the last thing the McCain campaign wants to hear. McCain recently appointed a national coordinator for evangelical and social conservative outreach. The Arizona senator also often points to his strong anti-abortion voting record. But Doug Munton(ph) doesn't think Baptists are one-issue voters. DOUG MUNTON : A lot of Southern Baptists are very glad to see a pro-life candidate, but there's a lot of issues involved in choosing a president, and that's just one of them. CELESTE HEADLEE : SBC members were passionate supporters of George Bush in 2000, and they're credited with helping him earn his second term. But Lee Pig (ph) says McCain just doesn't inspire the same enthusiasm. Mr. LEE PIG : I guess he's just not as charismatic, maybe, as Obama. Even though I'm not going to vote for Obama, but I don't feel a connection to McCain like I did Bush. CELESTE HEADLEE : That lack of a connection may be caused by doubt over McCain's religious credentials. Tom Patterson is from Rockville, South Carolina. Mr. TOM PATTERSON (Southern Baptist) : Well he says he's Baptist, but I don't know which church he's a member of. CELESTE HEADLEE : McCain has had a rocky relationship with evangelicals. In 2000, he denounced Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as quote, \"agents of intolerance.\" The senator actively sought endorsements from influential pastors John Hagee and Rod Parsley. But last month, McCain renounced those endorsements after some controversial statements came to light. Bev Ollono says Southern Baptists are not automatically going to support the Republican nominee come November. Ms. BEV OLONNO : God is not Democrat or Republican. To me, it's like humbling ourselves before God and Lord, who do you want? CELESTE HEADLEE : It's probably safe to say McCain has yet to win over the millions of Southern Baptists voters that helped George Bush get to the White House and stay there.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX COHEN, host : And I'm Alex Cohen. ALEX COHEN, host : Coming up, the question of who wrote a famous religious poem turns into a very unchristian battle. MADELEINE BRAND, host : First, remember the 1970s?  People talked to their houseplants, played them classical music. They were convinced plants were sensuous beings and there was that 1979 movie, \"The Secret Life of Plants.\" Unidentified Male : Only a few daring individuals, from the scientific establishment, have come forward with offers to replicate his experiments, or test his results. The great majority are content simply to condemn his efforts without taking the trouble to investigate their validity. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, some thirty years later, things may have changed. Scientists now report that a weed known as the Sea Rocket makes animal-like decisions. Susan Dudley carried out the study. She's an Evolutionary Plant Ecologist at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada and what did you discover that the Sea Rocket was doing? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well, what I discovered is that the plants made a different shape. They changed how much they put into roots when they were grown with strangers sharing the same pot, but not when they were growing with their siblings. So, their whole, how they grow - their morphology -  depends on who they are growing with and basically it shows that they can recognize their kin.  And we think that this is an indication that they are competing less with their kin. MADELEINE BRAND, host : They can recognize their relatives? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Or maybe recognize strangers, we don't know? MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, this must have been pretty astonishing? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : It was astonishing. I mean it was - there's a lot of good scientific reasons to look for it, but it is always astonishing when you think something is happening, and it turns out - or you look for it and it turns out that it actually is there. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, plants don't have a brain. They don't have eyes. They don't have a sense of smell, I don't think? So how are they able to do this? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well plants have a lot of ways of sensing the environment. They sense all sorts of things about the environment. And they while they don't have eyes, for example, they have photo receptors which let them sense things about the color of the light. And that is actually a really well-known way the plants can sense whether or not there are other plants around them. We think that this is probably a chemical cue. Some research  I'm doing in collaboration with someone at the University of Delaware, Harsh Bais, shows that there's something - they put something in the liquid surrounding the roots that illicits this stranger response. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And what good does it do the plant? Does it make it better able to live? To succeed? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Well, what we think is that - you know, our hypothesis, working hypothesis, is that competition is costly for plants and that if that they can agree not to compete, they will all do better. But the only ones that they can basically agree with would be their relatives. So, it's a kind of... MADELEINE BRAND, host : It sounds familiar. Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Yeah, no, that's why it's not sensitive new age guy kind of plants, but you know, plants that are out to get what they can. And in fact, this kind of agreement not to compete goes away when resources are scarce. You know, we had one study where we are writing up, that shows when resources are scarce, they'll compete as strongly with relatives as they will with anyone else. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, they are not actually thinking, they are just reacting to chemical inputs? Professor SUSAN DUDLEY (Biology, McMaster University) : Yeah, I don't - I don't feel any more guilt about eating salads then I ever did.  I definitely don't think that they are conscious, but I think that they are sensing things about the environment and responding to those things and perhaps even taking multiple cues from the environment into account as they respond. So the presence of competitors, the nutrients, whether those competitors are kin or strangers. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, this was the humble Sea Rocket, which is basically a weed. Do you think that other plants do the same thing and maybe plants that are a little fancier? Or more advanced than the weed could actually do more things? \n\n ###",

ALEX COHEN, host : I'm Alex Cohen. Madeleine, you were just asking me if you should get the new iPhone. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I was, just before this show, just wondering, well it's new, it's cheaper, maybe... ALEX COHEN, host : It's pretty swell. Now you've got the BlackBerry, right? MADELEINE BRAND, host : Yeah, I have a BlackBerry. ALEX COHEN, host : But you're not totally in love with it, baby? MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, I think we have a platonic relationship. ALEX COHEN, host : Well, you know it is tough figuring out how to design technology that will make us gals whip out our wallets. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And this week you've been doing a series on this. And today you've been looking at the differences in gender when it comes to gadgets. ALEX COHEN, host : Genevieve Bell is a cultural anthropologist for Intel. She spent a lot of time going into homes and observing how people use technology. Genevieve joins us now. Welcome to the program. Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : Hi, it's good to be here. ALEX COHEN, host : So, does gender really make a difference when it comes to technology? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : Of course it does. Gender, as we know, impacts all kinds of things. To understand how men and women use technology differently, I think you have to kind of back it up a little bit and think about how men and women have different, in some ways, lives and demands on their time. If you look at the data from the U.S. Department of Labor, if you look at the data from the United Nations, one of the things that's really striking is the ways in which the demands on women's time haven't in fact changed in nearly 50 years. We spend as much time now doing housework, child rearing and emotional work with those around us as we did 50 years ago. And add on to that our presence and paid labor, what you get is women who are really in some ways time constrained. And I think that drives a lot of our demands about technology. ALEX COHEN, host : A lot of these gadgets that you see out there geared towards women are pink or covered in jewels or fluffy in some regard. Does any of this actually matter to us as consumers? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : I've heard that jokingly referred to as that to sell technology to women you have to shrink it and pink it. Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : Which is terrible. I think in some ways those attempts are heading in the right direction but they're profoundly misguided. Women and I'd argue many men, know that how they look, how they conduct themselves, how they dress, how they're augmented impacts how people make sense of them. And it's part and parcel of how people know how to reach you in the world. And technologies have become part of that ensemble, if you will. I mean, they've become part of how we're made sense of, they're part of our identities. Particularly small mobile devices. Mobile phones, cameras, mp3 players, there's a whole constellation of technologies that we carry with us now, that have become ways by which people make sense of us. ALEX COHEN, host : What's been the biggest surprise to you in all this research that you've done? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : I shall think the biggest surprise to me came about three and a half years ago when we were doing some work on early adopters of Wi-Fi technology and wireless technology. And we discovered that women were in fact the early adopters. It wasn't men at all. And it was one of the first times I remember looking across the data of technology adoption statistics and technology use statistics where women were in fact leading men. ALEX COHEN, host : And when you're talking about wireless, you're meaning the ability to access the Internet from a number of locations, right? Dr. GENEVIEVE BELL (Anthropologist, Intel, Director of User Experience) : Absolutely. \n\n ###",

Lots of movies out this weekend that aimed to make you smile, \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan,\" \"Kung Fu Panda.\" ALEX CHADWICK, host : So, Mark Jordan Legan is here to tell you what the critics think of the new movies. It's our weekly feature from slate.com, Summary Judgment. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : It wouldn't be summer without a zany comedy from popular comic actor, Adam Sandler, and I'm sure many of you have seen the billboards for \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan.\" This timeout, he portrays a top Israeli commando who fakes his own death to pursue his dream, becoming a hairstylist in the Big Apple. Wow! It's sort of like \"Shampoo\" meets \"Munich,\" I guess? Unidentified Child : I don't want a haircut! Mr. ADAM SANDLER : (As Zohan) Young man, you know, you shouldn't jump around when this nice woman holding a sharp pair of scissors. If you move, she could slit and slice your jugular, man, on accident. All of your blood will be on the floor in four minutes. I've seen this, I've done this. You don't want this. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Many of the critics felt like crying as well. But then again, Sandler's movie seemed to be critic-proof. The Onion sighs, \"spectacularly unimpeachably, relentlessly, preposterous.\" Variety warns, \"It would require a talent of Peter Sellers' magnitude to conquer this material and he is not around.\" But the Austin Chronicle called Zohan, \"a crazed, delightfully, bizarre return to form for Sandler.\" Writer Steve Conrad, who penned the dark Nicholas Cage dramedy, \"The Weatherman,\" and Will Smith's uplifting \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" now makes his directorial debut with \"The Promotion,\" A supermarket comedy where two assistant managers battle to get the coveted managerial post at a new location. John C. Reilly and Seann William Scott square off. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Mr. JOHN C. REILLY: (As Richard) I think with just some black apples, no, we won't be seeing that happen again. Mr. SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT : (As Doug) You said black apples? Mr. REILLY : (As Richard) I said bad ones. Mr. SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT : (As Doug) You said black. Mr. REILLY : (As Richard) I'm sorry if there's some confusion. Maybe in the confusion, I... Mr. SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT : (As Doug) Hey, come on. It's been a long day. That was a slipped. Mr. REILLY : (As Richard) And I didn't mean to say black, I meant back, blatch, blah, blapples. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : The Nations critics are split on \"The Promotion.\" The New York observer raves, \"darkly funny.\" The LA Weekly chuckles, \"low key, witty and observant.\" But if you want to talk about clean up in aisle three, the Hollywood Reporter hated it, snarling, \"one of the unfunniest comedies ever.\" MARK JORDAN LEGAN : And hey, leave the gummy bears at home and bring plenty of bamboo because opening in wide release, says the Dreamworks animated comedy, \"Kung Fu Panda.\" Jack Black provides the voice for Po, a clumsy Panda who dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master. Everyone from Angelina Jolie to Dustin Hoffman also lend their vocal talent. Mr. DUSTIN HOFFMAN : (As Shifu) Hit it! Mr. JACK BLACK : (As Po) OK. Yeah. I mean, I just ate. So, I'm still digesting. So my Kung Fu might not be as good as later on. Mr. DUSTIN HOFFMAN : (As Shifu) Just hit it! Mr. JACK BLACK : (As Po) OK. How's that? Oww! MARK JORDAN LEGAN : The nation's critics get a kick out of \"Kung Fu Panda.\" \"Infectious and inspiring,\" shouts the Washington Post, and Entertainment Weekly cheers, \"light and goofy, lickety-split, mad fun.\" You know, I'm glad this film is showing their violent side because pandas are always presented as these cute, dazzling animals, but they really are the most vicious blood-thirsty, man-eating creatures in the world. Oh! Come on. How did an enraged giant panda get into the studio? \n\n ###",

I am Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I am Alex Chadwick. Coming up, one man's mission in a city of risk, bringing happiness to the streets of Las Vegas. MADELEINE BRAND, host : First, the basketball fans last night witnessed the rebirth of one the greatest rivalries in sports, the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. In the 1960s, it was the Celtics' Bill Russell versus the Lakers' Wilt Chamberlain. In the 1980s, it was Larry Bird versus Magic Johnson. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And now to the surprise and delight of many, both teams are back in the finals. The Celtics won last night in a really dramatic Game One. NPR's Chris Arnold reports from Boston. CHRIS ARNOLD : There was a lot of hype and expectation around last night's game, the epic rivalry reborn, and the teams delivered, playing a close and exciting Game One. The night's signature moment came in the third quarter, when Celtics star Paul Pierce collapsed clutching his knee, and was carried off. But he soon returned playing with a sprain, and drained a pair of big three-point shots. CHRIS ARNOLD : Also good for the Celtics, Lakers' star Kobe Bryant's shooting was a little bit off, something that's unlikely to continue. But even before the game started, Celtics fans were hungry. CHRIS ARNOLD : Carol Sexton (ph), who says she's been a Celtics fan for 47 years, was jumping up and down and screaming before the game. Ms. CAROL SEXTON (Boston Celtics Fan) : No, I do that every game. I stand there and I do the jumping. Mr. JOE SCOTCHELL (Boston Celtics Fan) : Just like KG. Ms. CAROL SEXTON (Boston Celtics Fan) : Yeah, I do, yeah, yeah. My kids think I'm crazy. CHRIS ARNOLD : Joe Scotchells (ph) was cheering next to her. He's been coming to games most of his life too, and remembers the Larry Bird days. Mr. SCOTCHELLS : I came to Bird's first game with my father. CHRIS ARNOLD : Oh, wow. Mr. SCOTCHELLS : Yup, they let out a - I'll never forget. They let out a white dove into the rafters. And they flew around for, like, weeks. I'll never forget that. This is definitely great to have them back to where they used to be. Ms. CAROL SEXTON (Boston Celtics Fan) : This is tremendous, so exciting. CHRIS ARNOLD : In recent years, the Lakers have had Bryant and a bunch of good players. They've won a few championships. But Celtics fans have been lost in the desert for a long time. For way more than a decade, the team has been really bad. They lost 18 games in a row last year. Brian Demaso (ph) was getting a beer at half-time. Mr. BRIAN DEMASO (Boston Celtics Fan) : It was painful, man. It was painful. CHRIS ARNOLD : The Celtics had their beleaguered and frustrated star, Paul Pierce, but nobody really good for him to work with. Then at the end of last season, in some bold trades, the team scored two more all-stars. The deadly three-point shooter, Ray Allen, and this year's defense MVP, Kevin Garnett, KG. Mr. BRIAN DEMASO (Boston Celtics Fan) : All of a sudden, you got Garnett, it's, like, awesome. CHRIS ARNOLD : Garnett is a basketball gladiator. He pounds his chest. He screams. He glowers at other players with a sweat-streaked, wide-eyed stare. But he is also a team player who's as good a passer as he is a shooter, and he's earned respect from everybody on the court or off. That includes Rick Berthold (ph) and Bill Cargen (ph), who were wearing green plastic hair and Celtics hats. \n\n ###",

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX COHEN, host : And I'm Alex Cohen. Roman Polanski is one of the world's most famous directors. He made \"Chinatown,\" \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"The Pianist\" and other great films. MADELEINE BRAND, host : His achievements though, are overshadowed by something he did more than 30 years ago, back in the 1970s. Unidentified Newscaster : Starting with his lawyer Douglas Dalton Polanski was asked by deputy district attorney Roger Gunson to what count he pleaded guilty. Polanski: \"I had intercourse with a female person, not my wife, who was under 18 years of age.\"  Gunson: \"How old did you think the girl was?\" Polanski: \"I understood she was 13.\" MADELEINE BRAND, host : Right before he was to be sentenced, Polanski fled to Paris, never to return to the United States for fear of being arrested. That story, what happened during the trial and the fallout is told in a new documentary that airs on HBO tonight. Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I don't think anyone, other than the two of them know what really happened, but I was more interested in what happened after that and what made him flee. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Marina Zenovich is the director of the documentary \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired.\" Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : You know, for me, with Roman Polanski, you always have to go back in time. You know, it starts with his childhood in Poland where he survived the Holocaust where his mother was murdered. Goes to London in the swinging 60s and is making films, \"Knife in the Water,\" \"Cul-de-sac.\" Meets Sharon Tate, they fall in love and what was surprising for me was to just see how he had such hope in his life at a certain point when he was a hot young director after making \"Rosemary's Baby.\" And then she was murdered. So, for me, in going back, it just painted a picture, for me, of what brought him to this night in 1977. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, do you think that the murder of Sharon Tate, and he did say his marriage to her was the happiest time of his life, do you think that after that he fundamentally changed? Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I think Roman Polanski is the survivor, but I thought Mia Farrow said it best, kind of that he didn't have the blueprint for life that most of us do Ms. MIA FARROW (Actress) : One hoped for Roman, you know, this brand new life with a woman who loved him, and who seemed so right for him. With a baby that there would be this security. That he had not had in his life, and in a new homeland. I mean the future was his, we thought. And then everything just collapsed. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Now, this was - as you paint in your documentary, an incredible media circus, almost on the level of the OJ trial, and at the center of it, is the judge. Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, a fascinating character, I could have made a film about him. Rittenband was an elderly jurist who was quite powerful and cherry-picked this case, very media savvy and interested in what people thought of him. MADELEINE BRAND, host : But he is - he's blamed by not only Polanski and Polanski's defense attorney but also the prosecutor for a miscarriage of justice. Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : Yeah, I mean, when I was interviewing the lawyers and discovered what had happened kind of behind closed doors, I was astounded. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, what happened? What did he do that was the issue? Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : Polanski pleads guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. The punishment was supposed to be based on a probation report. The judge got the probation report and it said that he wasn't a mentally disordered sex offender and the he shouldn't go to jail. And I think he was feeling a lot of pressure and didn't know what to do, so he started enlisting advice from Richard Brenneman who was a young journalist for the Santa Monica Evening Outlook at the time. He said, you know, I went into his chambers and he looked at me and said, Dick, tell me, what do I do about Polanski? Mr. RICHARD BRENNEMAN (Journalist) : I went, whoa, Your Honor, that's your decision, that's not mine. I'm a reporter, I can't advise you on something like that. I hadn't been covering courts that long, but I knew a decision by a judge was supposed to be a decision by a judge and was not to take in any advice from any other person other than what was there on the law books, what had been entered into evidence in the case. Ms. MARINA ZENOVICH (Director, \"Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired\") : I mean it's all this kind of manipulation of how these cases work.

Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : On Saturday was the day of feeling, OK? We told everybody, you know what? Get it out. Feel your feelings, be mad, be happy. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Gloat. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Yes. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Complain. Whatever you want to do. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And what did you hear? Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : People were complaining. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : We were gloating. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : A lot of gloating. Anger. A lot of anger. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Happiness. You know, a lot of mixed emotions. But we said come Sunday morning, you will get in line. That's right. Sunday was the day of healing. Saturday was feeling, Sunday is healing. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : And it's time to get behind Barack Obama.  When I hear people say they're not going to vote, or they're going to vote for McCain because Hillary didn't get the nomination, I get really concerned. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Well, it makes me feel as though you didn't support Hillary. You were supporting something else. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Yeah. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Because if you were for her ideals and platform, and the things that Hillary Clinton was about, you couldn't be supporting John McCain. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Or refusing to vote. MADELEINE BRAND, host : What does Barack Obama need to do, if anything, what does he need to do to win them over? Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : I think for one thing I think that Hillary, she needs to go out there and campaign with him as actively as possible. And really, as I think she did in that speech, demand it of her supporters. You know, because she was basically like your mama, would be like, oh you will! Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : You will! Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Help this man get elected. If I have to do it, you have to do it. But I think for Barack, the things I think he can do are really speak to the country as he has, but make it clear this isn't about his, him being a man, him being African-American, him being, Hillary Clinton being a woman or being white. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Right, exactly. \n\n ###",

And this is NEWS & NOTES. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's Black Friday and we don't mean race. Retailers are hoping holiday shoppers will make a mad dash to their local malls, but maybe you'll sit this one out, stay home in your pajamas and shop online. Before you hand your credit card number over to the Internet, there are few things you should know. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Here with safety tips and more is our regular tech contributor Mario Armstrong. Hey, Mario. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Hey, Farai. How are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Shopping online, much more popular. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Yes, it is. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : According to the Sacramento Bee, holiday surveys say that the number of online shoppers will jump 30 percent. So there is this whole issue of safety, what should people know? MARIO ARMSTRONG : It is this whole issue of safety and they're just talking about Black Friday. They're not even - really even mentioning cyber Monday, which is the big online shopping day. But a couple of things to think about. Number one - and I don't know if you've done this, Farai, but do not use a debit card. Have you ever done that? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Oh, I paid the price. I had - someone hacked into my account and then I had no money in my bank account. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Oh, see, I didn't even know that. Seriously, folks, you cannot use your debit card. And that's the number one reason. It is direct access to your checking account. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Number two, with debit cards, they don't have the same protection as do credit cards. So if something was to happen or if you didn't like the goods that you bought, you have other protections in place. Something else to look out for, the season is running rampant with what is called fishing scams. And this really means a couple of things. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Number one, just do not click links in an e-mail. I know you've seen this e-mail, Farai. You know, they come out and they say, hey, click here for a special discount at what seems to be a respected outlet. And you click that link and you'll land on the Web site and it looks totally legit. They've copied it from corner to corner of the screen, but it, in fact, is a sight that's capturing any personal identifiable information that you may place into the site. So don't click on any links in any e-mails. Use one credit card for all your cyber shopping and then make sure that the Web site is secure. Look in the top bar where it says http and look for the S to make sure the site is secure. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So now that we have our safety tips, what are we going to spend our money on? MARIO ARMSTRONG : Ah, so - too many choices out there. I mean, everything from - the hottest things that you're going to see, really, this season are large screen televisions, people are really interested in making that purchase and are looking for good deals on that. But handheld devices like smartphones are always on the top category. Digital cameras, mp3 players are number one on the list again this year. And what rounds out kind of the top five are GPS devices. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we've talked a little bit about this conversion to HDTV, but buying a flat screen doesn't have that much to do with it. I'm sure that most of the ones now are HD. Is that - well, actually maybe I'm not sure. What do you think about that? MARIO ARMSTRONG : Yeah. That's a great point. I mean there's a lot of confusing going on in this whole market about television. High definition is kind of like the Cadillac or, I don't know, BMW, top of the line for your television screens. So you do need to be educated when you're going shopping to make sure you are, in fact, getting an HDTV if you are intending to watch HD television programming. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, there are all these choices. There's LCD and Plasma. MARIO ARMSTRONG : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Someone told me that one of them you shouldn't lay flat after you use it and then all these rules. What's the difference? What's the pro? What's the con? MARIO ARMSTRONG : You need to know the environment where the TV is going to be. That's number one. Is the room a dark room? Does it have a lot of natural light? Will it be in a sun room? If it's in a dark space, Plasmas do excellent in dark rooms. They're great for movie buffs and to really mimic that home theater experience. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : If you're just tuning in, today we're talking about how to survive family tensions during the holidays with Karen Hudson, co-author of \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times,\" also La Joyce Brookshire. She's a minister, naturopathic doctor and author of the upcoming \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Thanks again. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Thank you. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So Karen, you are someone who has not only multiple generations of living family in the same city, you also are in the family business. You must have had to work a lot of stuff out in order to be able to have your sustained, civil discourse with all the members of your family. What happened or helped you at moments when your tempers were frayed? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : I don't know that it's temper as much as frustration. And I worked for my brother at Broadway Federal Bank, and it's the kind of thing where, you know, sometimes it's not a decision I want made. I come from a family who's very chauvinistic and, you know, the men sort of run things when it comes to business. But, on the other hand, my brother has been very generous in allowing me in my creativity, allowing me an opportunity to participate in decision making. So it's frustration that never carries over. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Do you have any advice if you have lost your temper, and I'm not saying you ever have, but if you do lose your temper, what's the protocol then? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Well, I've had and I've also worked with other relatives, you know, not at the bank necessarily, but you lose your temper. And I don't think it's any different than any other situation. There's a way to handle everything. For me, it's not cussing and fussing. I will make my point known. I will make it known at the appropriate time. And the one thing with family business is you don't do it with an audience. I think it says what Joyce said earlier: You take it aside, you do it in different position. My brother is generous enough that it's not even if you don't disagree, it's like we didn't get that assignment, and he's never going to ask me about it in the family dinner. Never. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, LaJoyce, what about you? If you happen to get hot under the collar about something that a kin has done, what do you do to open up after that -reopen communications? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : We tackle it head on. We call family meetings. We - we're scattered about the country, so we don't have the luxury of being in the same city. There are a nest of us that are still in Chicago. I'm not in Chicago anymore. But - and they do see one another regularly, but we are a family who has always been encouraged to let it out, let it go and let God. And so in that, we don't - with my immediate family - I have six brothers and two sisters and I have probably 32 nieces and nephews and 10 great nieces and nephews. So we are crew. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And, you know, when ever one is hot under the collar and in a family situation and when we are together, it's like the whole room filled with tension. So something a person in the family will hold the other person - the two people's hands who were at odds - and drag them off to a room and we know what's happening back there, that they are forced to work it out. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about kids? You have a 5-year-old daughter with your second husband. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Yes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And I'm sure there's a lot of young kids in your family. Do you feel that you can reach out and touch someone who's not your child, or do you feel -and I don't mean necessarily here - I just mean, what's the protocol around that for you at holidays if you see some kid acting out? Do you feel like you can go up and approach them about it? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : No, absolutely. We believe that it takes an entire village to raise a child, and I was - grew up in a unique neighborhood in Chicago on the South side. Our block, we still have several families who were there when I was raised there and the children have now bought houses on the block. And if people die, they still buy - other people in the families buy the houses. So we have a very tight-knit community. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And as you say that, I - it comes to mind of our block-club party when I was home in Chicago this summer in July. And you know, the kids were cutting up. Well, one person, Ms. Alice from down the block, had four of the children, like our kids, by the hands bringing each of them to the center of the street and made them apologize and, you know, for the infraction that they had created. And we just sat around and said, um, Ms. Alice took care of that. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And because - but now the problem is that the oldest don't step in enough because they are afraid that, you know, A, they might get shot, they might get told off. You know, there are lots of reasons why the village doesn't raise the children anymore, but we are firm believers of still doing that. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : You know, I grew up on the same block. It just happened to be in Los Angeles. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author, \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Mm-hmm. \n\n ###",

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And I'm Madeleine Brand. Coming up General Motors announces that it will close plants that make SUV's and it may scrap the Hummer. ALEX CHADWICK, host : First, in South Dakota and Montana today, the long primary season finally does end. There are conflicting statements reported from the campaign of Senator Clinton about her plans. MADELEINE BRAND, host : The campaign chair says she will not concede, but an earlier report from the Associated Press quotes her senior campaign official saying the Senator would acknowledge that Senator Obama will get the number of delegates he needs to get the nomination. The Clinton campaign, again, refutes that report. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John Dickerson, chief political writer for Slate.com, John, is this a careful parsing of language, or what? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Yes, it's a careful parsing of language. It's also language coming out in the middle of negotiations between the two campaigns, negotiations that are going on in both real time and also in the press. And it's also a sign of confusion. One of the big thing that's up in the air is the question of does Barack Obama have the actual numbers? And that will push Senator Clinton, I think, one way or the other if by the time she's giving his speech he's gotten over that important threshold number. And we'll just have to see if that happens. ALEX CHADWICK, host : This number is 2,118, that's the number of total delegates that you will need now to win the nomination in the Democratic Party, that's the number. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : That's exactly right, and Obama will get to that number. It's just a question of whether he gets to it tonight. You know part of this, the parsing, is about what Senator Clinton will say tonight in her speech after these primary results come in. And if by that hour the magical number has been reached that will affect the speech in one way. If that magical number isn't reached until, say, tomorrow, a few more superdelegates come out, then that changes what Clinton may be forced to say when she speaks tonight. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John, we do know that Senator Clinton has plans for this big event in New York tonight, this speech you've referred to. She's called in supporters and big donors from all around the country - invited them to come to this event. There are reports that word has gone out to staff that they have one more week left and then the campaign is not going to be paying them any longer. What are they waiting for? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Well, they are waiting, both sides are waiting, as you point out, it's over. Now the question is just how to manage the end. And there are a couple of constituencies here. One, Clinton wants to have maybe some of her debts paid off. There are a lot of rumors going around. So - there's a question of her debts. There's also a question of her supporters, some of the African-American supporters, have taken a lot of flack for supporting her and not Barack Obama. Then there's the question of the vice presidency. Will she be offered it? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Will they at least have a conversation about it? And then there are all kinds of other issues, including will Barack Obama say anything, perhaps, to tamp down or absolve Bill Clinton of some of the things he's said that have been perceived by some people to have a kind of racial tinge to them? Lots of issues to be played out there. Barack Obama doesn't want to force Clinton's hand too much. He knows it's over, he knows he's got the numbers. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : In fact, one of the ways he'll be evaluated by her supporters, many of whom have raised the charge of sexism, is how he handles her exit from the race. Is he sufficiently gracious? Does he being this party healing process that everyone's desperate, everyone in the Democratic Party anyway, is desperate to have begin. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Senator Obama is holding a rally in St. Paul, Minnesota tonight. That's where he's going to be, not in Montana or South Dakota, but St. Paul, Minnesota. What is the point of that? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Well, I'm actually with Senator Obama in Chicago right now. He's flying at the end of the day to Minnesota. That's where the Republicans will hold their convention. Minnesota is a swing state. And Obama is going there to basically kick off his general election campaign. He's had lots of little mini kickoffs, he's really been in a fight more with John McCain, much more so than Hillary Clinton. But this is an attempt for him to being telling the story that will consume us for the rest of the election year as we go into the general election. So he's going there and he'll talk about bringing people together. He'll talk about, you know, he's in a swing state so he has to be there to kind of fight for that state that will be important in the battleground map for the general election. And he wants to set the themes on his own terms for that general election battle with John McCain. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John Dickerson, from Slate.com, with Senator Obama on his way to Minnesota. John, thank you. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Writer, Slate.com) : Thanks, Alex. MADELEINE BRAND, host : One of New York State's last undecided superdelegates has decided. She is Irene Stein of Ithaca, New York and she's chairwoman of the Tompkins County Democratic Committee. She's here now. And welcome to the program, Ms. Stein, who are you backing? Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : I'm backing Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. I'm convinced having thought this through very carefully and watched every kind and source of information that I could think of that she is the candidate that is strongest against the Republican candidate John McCain. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Why did you wait until now? Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : Two different kinds of reasons. One, I take my responsibility as superdelegate very seriously and that responsibility is to act according to my judgment as to what would be best for the Democratic Party and the nation. Second, it was a very difficult situation for me personally because Tompkins County, my county, is the only county in New York State where a majority of the voters supported Senator Obama in the primary. So, I take that very seriously. \n\n ###",

And I was elected by the State Democratic Committee, which is heavily supportive of Hillary Clinton. I have a lot of conflicting pressures on me. I would watch the data very, very carefully, and I came to the conclusion that we will not win with Senator Obama if he is our candidate. Hillary Clinton is substantially stronger when you look at the analysis that shows how they fare in each state according to that state's Electoral College votes. Because as you know, the popular vote does not elect a president. Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : We found that out, unfortunately, at the beginning of the Bush years, in my opinion. The Electoral College vote does, and Hillary Clinton is very strong, and she easily beats McCain and this has been consistent. Putting that hard data together with my judgment and my gut based on about 30 years in political life, 30 years of interacting with people in politics, I just felt that Hillary Clinton is the much stronger candidate. MADELEINE BRAND, host : But do you worry that your vote now may be a little - too little too late? That Barack Obama... Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : I did not feel ready to make a vote earlier, and I don't know if I would have altered anything by making a vote earlier. MADELEINE BRAND, host : How do you feel though about going against the wishes of your constituents, the voters in your county who went for Barack Obama? Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : I'm not happy about it. But I was not elected by them to make this particular judgment and I've explained it to them to the best of my ability, and I hope and believe that they respect my goodwill and I think they fully understand no one will work harder than I to elect the Democratic candidate, no matter who that person is. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Ms. Stein, thank you for joining us. Ms. IRENE STEIN (Superdelegate, Chairwoman, Tompkins County Democratic Committee) : You're very welcome. MADELEINE BRAND, host : That's Irene Stein of Ithaca, New York, a newly announced superdelegate for Hillary Clinton. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Seattle lawyer and Democratic superdelegate David McDonald was on the Party's Rules Committee that met over the weekend to settle the difficult issue of the errant Michigan and Florida primaries. He stayed undeclared through that process and now says he will vote for Senator Obama. David McDonald, we spoke on Friday. Welcome back. How long have you known that Senator Obama is your candidate? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Democratic superdelegate) : Oh, I would say about 18, 19 hours, or so... ALEX CHADWICK, host : Really? You only just made up your mind, really truly? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Democratic superdelegate) : Yeah. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I know that you felt you shouldn't say where you were before this Rules Committee meeting over the weekend, but did you really have some instinct of where you were going? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Democratic superdelegate) : No. But what I had is from watching that either one of them could win the general election. And just to step back a bit on the process, I really was doing my best to simply not get attached to either candidate. But once the Rules Committee was over, I had the day to sightsee in D.C. and took it rather than watching news that day. And having a six-hour plane flight with no cell phone interruptions and unfortunately, or fortunately I suppose, no movies on the plane that I hadn't seen. And a night's sleep, and then woke up and thought, well, you know, I need to think about this, this morning, and started thinking about it, but I needed some free time, frankly. I mean, I kept coming back to the fact that Obama started with a 50-state strategy and was willing to go early into relatively tough territory where we for the last number of years have not really been contesting seats, and dig out Democrats and organize them. That and coupled with the energy level that I was seeing in Obama supporters were really kind of the tipping factors. ALEX CHADWICK, host : What do you think of the process this year? Because Senator Obama does come to the end of this, well, as John Dickerson writes at Slate.com, not sprinting across the finish line. I mean it's a difficult end for him. Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Democratic superdelegate) : It is a difficult end. But what he gains from it is he is tested. A president's got to be able to deal with surprises and adversity. I mean, let's face it. That job does not go according to script. So he's gotten out of this extended campaign something he never would have gotten if everybody folded up on February 15th. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You've said that you're confident either candidate can win the general election. Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Democratic superdelegate) : Yes. ALEX CHADWICK, host : But I wonder what is your assessment of Senator McCain as a candidate. And what does your party have to do in order to win? Against him? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's been nearly two years since the state of California executed Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams by lethal injection. Williams co-founded the notorious Crips gang. He'd been on death row since the early 1980s for four murders, he says, he did not commit. And that was just part of the controversy over whether Williams was unrepentant or uniquely valuable in the fight against gang violence. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : By time he died, he had committed himself to nonviolence and gang prevention. He wrote children's books. He was even nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Two years after his death, Williams' new autobiography has hit stores. It's called \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption.\" Author Barbara Becnel, a close friend of Williams, edited the memoir and wrote the epilogue. I asked her why Williams focused so much of the book on his childhood in South Central Los Angeles. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : It's just simply no doubt that the public school system failed Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams because it turns out, these many years later, he's tested for an IQ test and it turns out he's borderline genius, that the public school system in South Central Los Angeles in the late - mid-1960s and it did fail Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams. So - I mean, that's just the truth of it. But I guess he was just a symbol. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : This book really details how he went from someone who helped found the Crips, and then to move on once he went to prison to write children's books. I want to walk us through a couple of the different phases of his life. First of all, why don't you tell us why you think the Crips got started based on what Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams told you? Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : Well, what he said to me was that South Central in 1971 was not protected by the Los Angeles Police Department. And so - but it was overrun with gangs even prior to the Crips being formed. So what happened was both he and Raymond Lee Washington decided to get together and form a gang that would protect them and their friends and their family members from the gangs that were ruling the streets of both the Eastside of L.A. and the Westside of L.A. in the black community. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : So in that sense then, they started off as a self-policing entity. But albeit, they - what he conceded is that it didn't take long before the Crips then became the very thing that - and behaving in the very same way as the gangs that the Crips formed - to protect themselves from. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : From that, he was convicted. What were the crimes that he was convicted for? He always maintained that he did not commit those crimes. Explain them. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : Okay. He was convicted in 1981 of committing four murders during two robberies that occurred in 1979. And so he said right up until the, literally the day and the hour that he died - an hour before he died, I was talking to him on the phone - and he said, he did not commit these crimes. But - so that is what he said. And he - in his book, he talks about how the people who are oppositional to him say that he didn't deserve clemency or that he couldn't possibly be redeemed because he did not acknowledged and apologized for those crimes. And he says, in the book, it would be cowardly for him to confess to something he didn't do. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So Barbara, you were also left with some of his words that he left for the world before he died. Let's take a listen to one of them. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Mr. STANLEY \"TOOKIE\" WILLIAMS (Co-founder, Crips): My apology firmly goes out to all of the grieving mothers who have lost a loved one through street violence. For many years, I have shouldered the heavy encumber of this madness that perpetuates your sorrow. Your suffering has not gone unnoticed. I acknowledged it. I feel it. With humility, I express my deepest remorse for each of you for having help to create this bloody and violent legacy. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : Well, that message, Stan wanted the prisoners of San Quentin to hear, and the prison authorities would not allow it to be played, so I appreciate this opportunity because of those prisoners do listen to NPR. And though it's two and a half years after the fact, they can still benefit from his message. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Towards the end of his book, the very end, he talks about being free in spirit, if not in body. And he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize multiple times. What do you think his legacy is? Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : I think his legacy is several fold. One, he did end up being an anti-gang activist and a peacemaker over the last 13 or 14 years of his life. And it's really made a difference. For example, the day after his memorial service, a handful of Crips said the following - the governor wouldn't give my homey a clemency, but we have the power to give each other clemency by stopping the killing of each other. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : They formed a cease-fire committee. And now, two years later, it's about 250 Crip leaders strong and they have - those 250 Crip factions or sets have quit killing each other and the goal is to expand it to Bloods, and the goal is to ultimately expand it to Latino gangs in South Central and throughout the nation. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : His other legacy is a legacy of promoting literacy, because, for him, in terms of his own redemption or process of redemption, it really began in earnest when one of the prison chaplains brought him a dictionary. And with that dictionary, he learned the words that he needed to understand in order to read books and history books and black history books and that really changed his life. Because what he learned was that the black heroes were ordinary people who have prepared themselves and committed themselves to do extraordinary things. And that - it occurred to him, okay, I'm ordinary and I can work hard and I could reach out and do some extraordinary things. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : He also left me to edit about five or six more books, which I will edit and release in - over the next three to five years. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : And then lastly, his legacy is one of an activist legacy. The fact that the state of California largely, because of what happened to him, there's a de facto moratorium on executions here and now the Supreme Court has picked it up. You know, he may have succeeded ultimately in unraveling the death penalty in this country. At least, that's my hope and that certainly would have been his. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Barbara, thank you so much. Ms. BARBARA BECNEL (Editor, \"Blue Rage, Black Redemption\") : Thank you for allowing me to share what I experienced and what I've learned. Thank you. \n\n ###",

We asked some of our regular contributors to share their favorite Thanksgiving Day moments. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : First, here's political analyst Robert Traynham. Mr. ROBERT TRAYNHAM (Political Analyst) : Sitting down with my family on Thanksgiving Day with the football game on in the background, laughing, joking, eating way too much food, and really just reflecting on what family really means and love and friendship and respect. You know, Thanksgiving for me is a period of time where you sit back and reflect, not only about your life, but also about what family means and what love means. And so, that's what I'm going to be doing, is really just spending some good quality time and making sure that my family members know that I deeply care for them a lot. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist) : There's a large extended family of people who come to Winston Salem, North Carolina to celebrate Thanksgiving with Dr. Maya Angelou, and I'm privileged to be part of that extended family. That will be how I'm spending Thanksgiving and looking forward to just a warm, wonderful reunion with so many people who've been so important in my life. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Economist) : I have one memory that I enjoy about 10 years ago when I did my first Thanksgiving dinner at my home and had a tableful of people, and it actually turned out quite well. I was a little bit surprised given my culinary skills, but I have a picture, and I couldn't even put the year on it. We were just all sort of sitting there, kicking back, every body, really friendly conversation, just really appreciating the value of family. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : that was our economics maven Julianne Malveaux. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And here's essayist Jeff Obafemi Carr. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Author) : There was this one Thanksgiving holiday that we all decided to go and visit in Columbus, Georgia with some of my mom's relatives - a really small community, small neighborhood, not much to do, so me and some of the older cousins and my brother-in-law, we started walking through the neighborhood, and we saw a basketball court. So, of course, we went over to play basketball and there were a bunch of teenage boys there thinking they were Michael Jordan. Mr. JEFF OBAFEMI CARR (Author) : So, of course, they see the old cats coming and they want to challenge us to play a game of basketball. So we said, well, sure thing. So we lined up on either side and started playing basketball. And what do you know, we whipped the crap out of those kids. So they got angry and they said, no, you can't leave; you've got to play us again. And we played them again; we played them two more times, and we beat them. And they didn't realize it's because each one of them was trying to show off their basketball skills and we were setting picks and boxing out and doing things that old, slow guys do when they have to learn a game of basketball against kids, so we beat them soundly. And as we limped back to the house feeling full of pride, we just remembered that that was a great day when the old guys won. So we had a big dinner and we all went to sleep, and it's probably one of the best Thanksgivings I've had. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (Correspondent, Newsweek) : It's funny, my favorite Thanksgiving Day memory is not really - it's on Thanksgiving, but it really is with my grandmother. On Thanksgiving Day, they - she always wanted us, after dinner, after the turkey, after we were full, to go upstairs in the attic and get down Mary, Jesus and Joseph. That was her thing. That as soon as Thanksgiving, you know, dinner was over, we had to go up and get those, you know, plastic, sort of models of Mary, Jesus and Joseph, so we could set them up because she wanted all that time for it to be out in her yard. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (Correspondent, Newsweek) : So that that was like this ritual that we had to go and prepare for Christmas right after Thanksgiving dinner. So she gave no time to Thanksgiving. It was like, okay, we ate the turkey; it's done. Let's move on to Christmas now. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (Correspondent, Newsweek) : So that's my favorite memory because I love the little, you know, the little models of Joseph and Mary and Jesus. I love them; I thought they were so gorgeous, so that's why I would be the first one upstairs, you know, to sort of get them down. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : That was Allison Samuels, our entertainment contributor. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Sometimes, family meals mark a rite of passage. Here's essayist Patrice Gaines. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : When I was 12 years old, I was moved from the children's table to the adult table. I think it was because there were more children than chairs at the card table, which was the children's table. But I took the move to mean I had matured; that I was ready to sit with my parents and grandparents and other visiting adults. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : Mr. WILLIAM C. RHODEN (Columnist, New York Times): My favorite Thanksgiving memory is sitting in my grandmother's house in Harvey, Illinois with all my, like, 15, you know, relatives or brothers and sisters, eating Thanksgiving dinner, and then not having to clean up afterwards. Ms. PATRICE GAINES (Former Reporter, Washington Post) : I think I'm going to spend this Thanksgiving Day with my 83-year-old father and mother in Las Vegas. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Vegas, huh? That was our sports guru William C. Rhoden. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For political analyst Ron Christie, the best thing about Thanksgiving was the way it brought generations together. Mr. RON CHRISTIE (Political Analyst) : Without question it has to be back when I was in high school in California. My grandparents are both in their mid-90s now and they live Valdosta, Georgia, and they really don't like to travel. But that particular year, my folks were able to convince them to jump on an airplane, and they came out, and they had Thanksgiving dinner at our house, along with my brother and my parents and my uncle and his family. And it was just neat having our extended and our close in family under one roof at one time and just staying up and laughing, and, without question, my happiest Thanksgiving Day memory. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### ALEX CHADWICK, host : This is Day to Day. I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand. MADELEINE BRAND, host : In a few minutes, writer Pete Hamill remembers the last day of his friend Robert F. Kennedy. ALEX CHADWICK, host : First, John McCain, yes, John McCain - the other presidential candidate. He gave a major speech last night. That's what his campaign called it. He was in the city of New Orleans. Here he is. Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona) : I strongly disagreed with the Bush administration's mismanagement of the war in Iraq.  I called for the change in strategy. I called for the change in strategy that is now, at last, succeeding, where the previous strategy had failed miserably. Senator JOHN MCCAIN (Republican, Arizona) : I was criticized. I was criticized for doing so by Republicans. I was criticized by Democrats. I was criticized by the press. But I don't answer to them. I answer to you. ALEX CHADWICK, host : John McCain, the candidate of change but the right kind of change, he said last night. Former presidential speechwriter David Frum joins us by phone in Barcelona, where he is today. David, what did you think of that speech? Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Well, the McCain speech as a document was just terrific. It hit every point that John McCain needed to hit. And it did something very subtle.  While paying lots of compliments to Barack Obama personally, it dealt with the age issue that Obama subtlety raises against John McCain all the time by complimenting him on his half century of service to the country. John McCain raised it by saying, well, Barack Obama may be young, but his ideas are old. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I heard him say, it's surprising to hear a young man turn to the past for failed ideas. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Exactly. Now, the only thing that could have made the speech better is if we lived in an age where people absorbed political oratory from the newspaper because when you read the speech, it's just a perfect document. Unfortunately, we've invented radio and television and people hear it and see it, and it was not delivered with the kind of power and conviction that a speech so powerful and conviction-filled ought to have been delivered with. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So as you look ahead at the campaign, how is that going to play into things?  Senator McCain is a - enormously sympathetic political figure for many, many Americans, but as an orator, as someone who has to get up and excite a crowd, he's not a match as a candidate for Senator Obama. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : No, but he really doesn't need to be. I mean, I have a very simple map of what I think is happening in this election. The country is ready for a change and is ready to sweep out the incumbent party, the Republicans, if the alternative is acceptable. And the great question over the rest of the election is, is the alternative acceptable? And John McCain is John McCain. He is very much a known quantity. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : They know he was right about the war, and they know he got the tactics right. The surge was his idea. They know he is not on top of this economic issue and that's a problem, but he's known, and they respect his integrity and his record. Now you have this other candidate who is much less known and then you have this third force, Hillary Clinton, who I thought last night was sort of vowing to conduct a guerilla warfare campaign - we've lost the main battles, but I'm going to lead my band of party fighters up in to the hills and the war continues. And depending on how destructive she is, she may play a major part in convincing the country that the alternative to the incumbent is unacceptable, or at least impossible. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You write in the National Review online today that she may be campaigning for the vice presidency and if she is, that Senator Obama would find it almost impossible to say no, but very inadvisable to say yes. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Look, Mitt Romney is campaigning for the vice presidency. He's going around the country. He's making speeches. He's saying nice things about John McCain. Hillary Clinton is doing a little bit more than that. She's got 2,000 delegates or thereabouts. She is delivering a speech - I'm not giving up. Now, the question she is posing to Obama is, nice little convention you are going to have there in Denver, it would be a true misfortune if it were to be ruined by a whole series of challenges over credentials of Michigan and Florida. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : I mean, I could turn this thing into the worst convention since the Democratic convention of 1968. Would you like me to do that? If not, you'd better think about ways to make me happy. This is not campaigning for the vice presidency. This is putting a pistol to the man's head and - so, it's not an abstract question for Obama. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You know, this strikes me, David, we called you to talk about John McCain, and here we are still talking about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Maybe if they go on, Senator McCain will never get any attention and it will just be them. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : But this election really is about them. I really do think there is very little the Republicans can do to win this election. But there is a great deal the Democrats can do to lose it and so far, they are doing many of those things. ALEX CHADWICK, host : David Frum, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and he writes a column for National Review online. David, thank you again. Mr. DAVID FRUM (Columnist, National Review) : Thank you. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We're talking about diet in the holidays with Beverly Arnold from Detroit. She's her family's Thanksgiving Day cook but has made a commitment to staying fit that doesn't allow her to eat much of what she actually cooks. NEWS & NOTES' health and fitness guru, nutritionist Dr. Rovenia Brock, otherwise known as Dr. Ro, and her client, Astrid Chinn. She plans to maintain a healthy diet even with all the temptation that comes with the Thanksgiving Day feast. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome back, ladies. Dr. BROCK : It's a pleasure. Ms. ARNOLD : Yes, it is. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Astrid, after hearing about Beverly's tremendous success at losing a hundred pounds, does that give you more strength to do what you're doing, which is also extremely hard even though it's less weight? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Yes. Yes. The weight doesn't matter. It's a very hard struggle. Ms. ARNOLD : Yes, it is. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, having two children at this point, Astrid, has that changed how you have to deal with food, because kids like what kids like, which often involves cheese. Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Well, I tried to introduce to them different foods and healthy varieties, so they really won't be able to miss what they haven't had. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you really are trying to train them from an early age? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Yes. Yes. My 6-year-old asks for certain green vegetables. He loves broccoli and other things, so he doesn't know a lot about fast food. Dr. BROCK : Oh, good. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Dr. Ro, it sounds like that's the perfect way to really help raise your kids, is to raise them in an environment where they like healthful foods to begin with. Dr. BROCK : Well, yeah. I mean, kids have to see to be, so it's very difficult for you to instill in your child that it's important or good for you to eat broccoli if, in fact, you're not serving it at home. You know, we've talked about that very thing on this program, so that's one thing. Dr. BROCK : But the other thing is you have to also teach them the importance of how to make those choices even in a tight situation. So, if you happen to be outside the home, they have to know how to choose healthy there, too. I think the important thing is that when you set a good example and when you teach them about choices - food and lifestyle choices - that are going to work for them rather than against them, there's a better chance that they're going to stick to those even when they're not in your care, when they're outside of your view. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let's go back to something on adult's plates, at least some adults. Alcohol - what does that do to how you eat, how you metabolize food if that's part of your Thanksgiving Day feast - your holiday feast? Dr. BROCK : Well, you know, it's not - you never - the second glass of wine is never going to be as good as the first. So, just bear that in mind. Also know that there are seven calories per gram of alcohol in every serving. So it is not a free as you would - if you would. It's not a free beverage, so - it's not a calorie-free beverage. So, given that you're never going to achieve the feeling that you enjoyed with the first glass, after that, you might want to put the cork back in the burgundy. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How do you pick yourselves up? I mean, Beverly, even you, although you've had a surgery, you probably had moments of weakness. If you do something that you don't consider perfect, how do you pick yourself up? Ms. ARNOLD : You know, and I do give in to cravings at times. What I found that - sometimes - one day, I'd have such a horrible craving for ice cream, and I'm not a sweet eater. I don't care that much for ice cream, but I got a little container of ice cream, I eat two teaspoons of it just to taste it, and put it back in the freezer. When my grandchildren came, I gave it to them. But when I mess up, I have to get right back on track immediately. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We all know Thanksgiving is supposed to be a time of family fellowship. But some see Turkey Day and other holidays as grounds to spark or rekindle a family feud. Sibling rivalry, ex-spouses and the nutty uncle who packs food to go before dinner begins - all problems that can spoil the fun. So how can you have a drama-free holiday? Is there such a thing? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Joining us to give a few pointers are Karen Hudson, co-author of \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times,\" and LaJoyce Brookshire. She's a minister, a naturopathic doctor and author of upcoming \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome ladies. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Thank you. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Thank you for having me. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, La Joyce, you wrote the novel \"Soul Food\" and in the film, we see a lot of family drama. You also counseled people on their relationships. So why are the holidays such a stressful time? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Well, I think because it forces us to confront things that we don't want to. And it starts to build a month before the dread, the fearfulness, the, you know, have I lost enough weight, the do I look like I'm doing all right enough? You know, those kinds of things are stressors that press on us and cause us not to enjoy the holiday as much as we should because these are the things that we needed to probably confront even prior to the holiday, but we have not. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Is any of your family in \"Soul Food\"? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Oh yeah. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, I enjoyed family gatherings. In my family, I would never run from the table when we had the tourist conversation. You know, they always let me stick around for some reason. And I got to learn a lot about life. And when cousin Sheila(ph) had her problems and when cousin Sheila came around, I knew that we were going to, A, air dirty laundry and solve her problems. But what somebody would ultimately end up doing is - after the wisdom flew around the table, with all the gray hairs, then someone will go get the Bible to see what God had to say about it. So that's how all of the problems were solved in our family. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Karen, you may have a slightly different solution. \"Basic Black,\" the book that you wrote - when you think about the book that you wrote, trying to bring a little bit of order to the modern chaos around manners, how does that apply during the holidays? Is it any tougher, any different? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Well, I think it's tougher because the holidays represent the best and the worst of our childhood. It's all the food that we were happy to eat, and everybody comes home for, you know, grandma's sweet potato pies and somebody's macaroni and cheese. But it also has all the heartache and the things you remember about how somebody treated you when you were a child, and now you're an adult and you're coming home on a different kind of atmosphere. I come home a very different experience because I'm blessed to be a third generation living in the same town where the rest of my family is. So I see them on a regular basis. And I do not have one holiday where there was ever drama at the table. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : And perhaps that is because we were raised to care ourselves, like our grandmother was looking over our shoulder. As long as we did that\u2026 Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : It was a pretty calm day. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So what does that mean to you to have a civil and civilized holiday? What constitutes that? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : A lot of good food and, just, you know, even though I see my family on a regular basis. It's a time of celebration. And particularly, Thanksgiving is a time where you really do take note of what you're thankful for. And I think that one of the other things that I firmly believe is that, you know, we do need to take the commercialism out of the holiday season. I think that adds to a lot of the angst and a lot of the stress. You know, can I buy a good enough present? Do I get something for everybody? Is somebody going to buy me something? Am I going to ditch what they got me? But the other part of it for me is Christmas Day is my mother's birthday. So\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Mine too. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Really? Wow. And so, you know, we look at it a different kind of way. It is really a time of celebration. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Karen brought up something poignant, if I may interject, that you think about your treatment from childhood, which goes back to what I said about dealing with things that we have yet to confront, and that if you are really carrying something from childhood that Uncle Jimmy(ph) did to you that you have yet to confront and you dread going to Thanksgiving dinner because you know Uncle Jimmy(ph) will be there, it's time to confront it and let it go. \n\n ###",

I'm going to ask both of you that. LaJoyce, when is it appropriate, you think, to confront something? Is it\u2026 Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Not at the dinner table. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Right. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : I think that it's something - if it's something that comes up at every holiday it's obviously something that troubles you, and I think that it's maybe Uncle Jimmy needs a letter if you can't discuss it. Maybe Aunt Suzie(ph) needs to have a phone call and, you know, and then you could scream your guts out one on one without any other interaction or anyone else around. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Or maybe you can do it civilly and invite them out for a meal on neutral turf so that, you know, you're not at either person's house. However, you choose to do it, but you know, those are the enemies of our past that allow - don't allow us to move forward. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And so I would like for my child and my husband to have a relationship with Uncle Jimmy, but every time somebody mentions them, I can't. You know, so I think that those are the things also that help stop us from having a happy Thanksgiving and something to be thankful for and getting together with family be they far or near. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : You know, I have to take issue with the - whatever it was - scream your guts out with Aunty so and so. I don't ever think that solves anything. And I think that what we have to be mindful of, I think, your very own point when you talk about this and things we have to deal with. I think we have to deal with them with ourselves first before we ever confront - if that's the right term - the offending family member. And my thing is, don't do it during the holidays. Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : There are 11, 12 other months that, you know, we can look at things. (Unintelligible) on Independence Day. Write that letter then. You know, call them, invite them to dinner, whatever you have to do - and particularly if you're not on the same city. And you have a concern about your children, And particularly now they're in the same city and you have a concern about your children particularly if it's a concern that might have to do with some prior abuse or something like that, you know, then you distance yourself a different kind of way. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We've had conversations during the course of this series on the family about when you just have to burn the bridges behind you. LaJoyce, I guess, on a personal level, you've had a very - you had a very difficult relationship with your former husband. You had to nurse him through an illness, and he had lied to you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Why don't you just tell us a little bit about that and did you burn the bridge behind you, or did you stay in touch with him? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Okay. Well, in 1990 I married a man who swept me off my feet and who came into my life like prince charming. And two years into the relationship, I discovered he had full-blown AIDS. And it wasn't until he was almost dead that I found out he knew he always had AIDS that he was always infected. I am victoriously negative. And - also, I didn't know until after he was dead that he was on the down low. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : So, yes, I burned the bridges because, well, he died and, you know, I refused to allow him to strangle me from the grave. I refused to not forgive him because, obviously, he didn't know any better, and because I'm God's girl for real, and to be exposed to the virus multiple occasions and to not become infected, I am completely God's girl. And so in that I knew that I couldn't harbor on to un-forgiveness. Also in my work as a naturopathic doctor, I understand that un-forgiveness is the emotional component of cancer. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : And so, it wasn't worth holding on to this piece of something from - for a dead man. So I also buried his family when I buried him, especially his sisters who knew that he was infected when they stood up in my wedding. So I forgive them and have watched their lives completely fall apart. And so there are a few people in his family who I have chosen to have relationship with. And it is very comforting and a nurturing relationship on both parties as we have. And we enjoy each - one another's company. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I bring this up for two reasons. One is because your upcoming book is on this topic, but secondly, when we think about holidays, we think about memories. And what do you do with the memories of the holidays that you spent with your former husband? Do you try to erase them? Do you just acknowledge them and move on? Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : Mm-hmm. I acknowledge them and move on. Because the holiday season for him was tumultuous, so he brought in those feelings. His uneasiness and his conflict that was unsettled in his family, he brought that in - with him into our relationship. See that's the part about teaming up and marrying someone who you know him but you don't know him. Dr. LaJOYCE BROOKSHIRE (Naturopathic Doctor; Author \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love\") : So all of those of things would have uncovered themselves if I would not have been in such a hurry to get to the altar if you will. We met and married within 11 months. So, you know, when you take the time to find out what a man's relationship is with his momma, you know, what his relationship with his sibling, and why do they have such a horrible, venomous relationship, and it's obviously because of family secrets, which ultimately steal, kill and destroy. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let me go to you, Karen, your mother being born on Christmas day as mine was, and we celebrate every year, does that add a level of expectation to the holiday that weighs it down or does it lift it up and make it something different? Ms. KAREN HUDSON (Co-Author, \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times\") : Clearly, lifts it up. I think that when my mother after about 50 years said I'm not doing Christmas anymore so I inherited it. And every year, it's like how can I make it more special for mom. And mom grew up, you know, like your momma I'm sure never had a birthday party on her birthday with her friends. And my grandfather, my mother's father, just spoiled her rotten with the Christmas presents and the birthday presents. And when he passed, even though she was an adult, it was like, you know, the little kid in her came out. And so we go to great lengths to have a birthday cake to do all the things that she never had as a child. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, I want to share more about family stories, family wisdom and just plain good manners, but we have to take a break. Thank you so much for this beginning of the conversation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We are talking with Karen Hudson, co-author of \"The New Basic Black: Home Training for Modern Times,\" also with La Joyce Brookshire. She's a minister, naturopathic doctor and author of the upcoming \"Faith Under Fire: Betrayed by a Thing Called Love.\" \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Today, we've got a special Reporter's Roundtable that's all about the holidays at the newsstands. Family, faith and gift giving are popular topics between the glossy covers of some of your favorite magazines. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : With me now, Angela Burt-Murray, editor-in-chief of Essence magazine; also, Newsweek's national correspondent Allison Samuels; and Bryan Monroe, vice president and editorial director of Ebony and Jet magazines. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome folks. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Hi. Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So as this year wraps up, one of the major themes for magazines is the most influential people of the year. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Angela, tell us how you're going to cover that at Essence. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Well, we've put together our first annual influential list, which is really a roundup of not only the bold-faced names like politicians and celebrities and people like you'd expect to find on a list like this, but also the ordinary people in the African-American community who are doing extraordinary things. So the people that really got us to think in different ways this year. So it was a pleasure to put together this list to salute, again, the people that you would expect, and also some surprises. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give me one of those surprises. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Ah, I think one of my favorites on the list is a woman named Gina McCauley, who is the blogger who founded the site whataboutourdaughters.com. And she's basically started a grassroots campaign, challenging some of the images, the negative images that we see in the media as it relates to African-American women. And this year, she successfully lobbied advertisers to pull out of the show that BET was putting on the air, \"Hot Ghetto Mess.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \"Hot Ghetto Mess.\" Yeah. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Yes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We've had Gina on many times. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Yes. Yes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And she's one of our favorites. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : She's fascinating. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Bryan, what about Ebony and Jet? Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Well, you know, we've got our current issue on the stands, which have someone we've all been following for a while, Michael Jackson, on the cover. We'll talk about that a little bit later. Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : But inside, you know, we're looking at the holiday gifts and actually doing this in Ebony and in Jet magazine, and now on our Web site, ebonyjet.com, and specifically looking at technology - everything from GPS systems to flat screen TVs and trying to make the distinction between LCDs and plasmas, and why you should buy one and buy the other. Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : But probably, one of our most interesting packages this month has been about Africa, and it's called the Africa You Don't Know, where we really wanted to take an authentic look at the continent - and this was the beginning of an ongoing series throughout the year - and look at it beyond the issues we're all familiar with \u2014 poverty, violence, and things like that \u2014 and really looking at the almost normal regular sense of Africa, from kids playing to entertainment to booming issues with economics, and now the inclusion of China in the new economic development in many parts of Africa. \n\n ###",

What does Newsweek looks for when picking that person? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Well, you know, it differs from year to year, but I think this year, because next year is such a, you know, huge political year, I think this year they're focusing very much on sort of who's going to have the most impact on the campaigns. And that doesn't have to necessarily be the person running. It could be their campaign director. It could be, you know, who's going to shape that campaign. And, I think, you know\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Oprah? I want to think it's Oprah. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Yeah, now - I know. I was just about to say that, I think, because Oprah is putting her hat in the ring. I think that, you know, she has a pretty good shot at that. I do think that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you do you get to weigh in on this? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : We all get to weigh in on it. Now, whether they listen to us is a whole another thing. But we all do get a vote on, you know, sort of, you know, who would you suggest this year has \u2014 did you see as next's year's going to have the impact because that's the whole key for us. It's who's going to actually have that kind of impact for the next year. That's - they sort of call it who's next? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I want to turn to matters of faith. Some publications look into matters of faith at the end of the year. It's a logical time to do that. And Angela, Essence is featuring an interview with Juanita Bynum. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Yes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Tell me a little bit about that, and why you decided to put her in the issue? Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Well, Juanita Bynum found herself thrust into the spotlight a couple of months ago, when she and her husband had an unfortunate altercation in a parking lot. And it really brought to ahead for the African-American community the conversation about domestic violence, and specifically as it relates to the church. Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Historically, the church has been loathed(ph) to tackle this very important issue, while statistically we know that African-American women are suffering a great deal in these relationships. So we felt it was important to sit down with Dr. Bynum and talk about her experience, but also hear the message that she wanted to share with women who might find themselves in similar situation. So it's a really, really important conversation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I know that she has mentioned in the past that she really wants to make this part of her ministry. Did she expand on that? Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Right. Yes, absolutely. This is actually a two-part series that we're very proud to be presenting. The first part is in the December issue, and then she is actually the cover of the January issue, where she will then take that opportunity to talk about her new ministry and how she plans to go forward to help women who are in similar situation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Allison, what does Newsweek have on tap in terms of faith? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : At this point, they haven't sort of decided what they want to do, but usually when they post it to the, you know, actual last issue of the year, they'll tackle some, you know, particularly interesting issue, whether it be like Mother Teresa's book that came out earlier this year where it talked about Mother Teresa sort of challenging her faith, you know, during the early years of her life. You know, they'll choose something like that to sort of, you know, focus on and sort of talk about what impact that have for the year in terms of, you know, faith and how people of faith actually handle that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Bryan, do you \u2014 do anything about Kwanzaa in addition to Christmas or any of the other religious holidays? Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Well, actually we have a coverage of both Kwanzaa and other religious aspects to the holiday season. Kwanzaa is in our December issue. We take a very different look at it. We decided to test question why we celebrate or, in many cases, why we don't celebrate Kwanzaa, the confusion in the African-American community about what Kwanza is and what it's not, you know, that is not a religious holiday per se as much as a celebration of our heritage; and why for many African-Americans it's almost like we feel like we should celebrate it, but we really don't know why, and so most of us don't. And so we take a look at that. And then we go and look at sort of the other side of the coin with a very, very practical look at why and how to read the Bible. Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Joy Benet takes a very hands-on, utilitarian guide to going chapter by chapter, book by book in the Bible on how to use it in your everyday life. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm going to stay with you, Brian, on favorite story. I know that right now, we're talking about wrapping up the year, but any time from January on, what was your favorite story that you covered or you helped put together this year? Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : Well, that's a big question. We've had a some really great issues this year from our Barack and Michelle issue in February, where we hit the stands a week before he announced, with a great profile on them as a couple to - in May, I got to sit down and do the hard duty of spending a day or so with Halle Berry. And, of course, our July issue that we've decided to take all the pictures off the cover and take a serious look at the language of disrespected black American. \n\n ###",

We've been working on that for the last eight or nine months to lay in it that exclusive interview. And we got him to open up about a bunch of things, as well as a look back at the 25th anniversary of \"Thriller.\" Mr. BRYAN MONROE (Vice President and Editorial Director, Ebony and Jet magazines) : In spending three days with him, he is both complicated and in some ways not nearly as strange or as weird as people have painted him to be. And I think when readers both see the story in the magazine and also go online because we've put a lot of the audio clips from the interview up online, we've gotten reactions from all over the world \u2014 Finland, Germany, Tokyo \u2014 and overseas sales is just off the chain. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Angela, what about you? What was your favorite moment over the year? Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : I think that, you know, it's been a really strong year for us, but I think I'm most proud about our political coverage this year. We've devoted unprecedented real estate and women's magazines to the conversation about the election. And we had interviews with Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And we felt like it was important to do this because statistics have shown that in the next election, in the African-American community, African black women will cast six out of ten votes. So, you know, we're a very influential voting bloc this term, and it's really important that the candidates speak directly to the issues that black America wants addressed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Allison, what about you? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : I guess, my favorite story this year was a conversation, well, actually, it was an interview that I sort of - that I had with both Holly Robinson Peete and Lilly Tartikoff whose husband, Brandon, was the head of NBC for many years. Both of them have children that are ill. Holly's son is autistic and Lilly's daughter was brain damaged in a car accident. And it was just very emotional, sitting there, listening to these two women who I had never met before talk about what it's like to be the mother of a child who is ill and who necessarily won't get better. I think it put a lot of things into perspective, but also it was just interesting to see two women - one African-American, one not - bond so, you know, so quickly, and so many shared experiences that they had gone through with their children. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : And I think it just sort of gave me a new look at just sort of, you know, what's important and what's not because these are women who said most parents want their children to go to Harvard. They think that's like an accomplishment. But for them, you know, Lilly Tartikoff said her daughter, just being able to raise her head for, like, five minutes at a time was a thing that made her day. And, I don't know, I just felt like, you know, that was just an important story for people to see because, I think, sometimes we do take a lot of those kind of things for granted. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : All right. Well, we are running out of time. I know that, Brian, you mentioned a little bit about gift giving. You're going to talk about technology. Angela and Allison, briefly, any gift advice in your magazines? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : I know for us, we're going to do a lot about the many programs where you can give back to Africa. You can, you know, give $50 to buy a goat for a woman in Kenya so she can feed her family. We're trying to do more things like that and not make them so materialistic. We're really trying to focus on gift giving to, you know, international countries. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Allison? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Yes? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Oh, sorry, that was - I'm in confusion, people, excuse me. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Okay. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Angela? Ms. ANGELA BURT-MURRAY (Editor-in-Chief, Essence) : Yeah, well, okay, I guess, we're the opposite of what's Newsweek covered in their gift-giving guide. We did go on the luxury side of things, and tried to put together some things that were just simply too beautiful to resist for women. So there's everything from handbags, and shoes, and fragrance, and furs and, you know, just a wonderful, a range of things, but also the service of the best places to shop online, the best catalogs, the best stores, and the best place to shop for children. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : All right. Well, Angela, Brian, Allison, thanks so much and happy holidays. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Thank you.

So go ahead, keep your plates packed and glasses full. If you want to eat, drink and be merry today, be ready to pay the prize tomorrow though. If you're on a strict diet that grand Thanksgiving spread can cause some serious temptation. How do you figure out what's really good for you at the dinner table, and what's just the delicious diet buster? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Here to help us sort it all out is Rovenia Brock, NEWS & NOTES health and fitness guru also known as Dr. Ro. And here to speak for the struggling masses is Beverly Arnold of Detroit. Beverly makes Thanksgiving dinner every year, but for health reasons, she doesn't eat very much of it. Also with us is Astrid Chinn. Astrid had her second child a little over a year ago. For several months now, she's been working with Dr. Ro to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight and maintain a healthy diet. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome ladies. Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : It's a pleasure to be with you, Farai. Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Thank you. Thank you. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : Yes. Thank you for this opportunity to share. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Beverly, let's start with you because you cook a big spread every Thanksgiving for your extended family, but for health reasons you can't enjoy the food like everyone else. Tell us about the decision that you made. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : The decision that I made I know with my body that there are certain foods that I just cannot eat. So I tried to limit, no, I tried it where our stomach only holds so much so I would try to get a little tinny bit of this, a little - just to give me a taste of everything. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : But even that was too much for me. So I had to get it in my mind to do a little preplanning and determine the main thing that I was happy to have, I'd eat turkey. I like the white meat so that's no problem. I eat the green vegetables, then I might be able to have just a teaspoon of some of the other goodies, and that's basically about it. All the total I cannot even eat like a salad bowl, a salad dish, I couldn't even eat that much. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So how do you feel when you are at a table that's loaded up, a groaning board that you have set up, and yet you can't kind of get up to your elbows in food the way most people do? Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : The first year was really a struggle, but I had just had the surgery. So that was really a struggle. I almost had to - we eat in a dining room. I had to go in the kitchen. I had to go in a kitchen, take my plate and go in the kitchen. That first year was really a struggle. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : There were so many foods that my body had not been used to eating and accustomed to because after the surgery they have what is called a new stomach. So my body was still getting accustomed to having different foods in my system. So that first year was really - that was really hard. But now I've gotten to the point where I know the things that I can and cannot eat well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Dr. Ro, having surgery is one very specific and often very successful way to lose weight and keep from overindulging. For people who have not gone through surgery, though, what keeps you in line? What advice can you give people? Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : I think the first thing is you've got to go - come to the table with the mindset that you are going to stick to your plan no matter how many times aunts - whomever - you know, pushes an extra roll or encourages you to have three or four servings of sweet potatoes. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : Right. Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : You have to come to the table with the mindset that it's okay to sample, as Beverly said, sample a little bit of your - and I would say pick your three top things, okay? We know that there are staples on everyone's table that which might be - might include the turkey, the stuffing, a vegetable, like greens or green beans or something, and another vegetable. So -but apart from that, there are so many accoutrement, if you will\u2026 Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : Right. Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : \u2026goes with this spread. And what you've got to do is really figure out what are my three favorite things and then just try to sample about three of those things, but small portions of those. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Astrid, you are working with Dr. Ro on your health and nutrition. I understand you're trying to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Yes, correct. I gained 50 pounds with my second child. He's now 16 months. And since March, I've been working with Dr. Ro, and I've lost 35 pounds; I have 15 pounds to go. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, when you think about eating at holidays, like Thanksgiving, do you think of that as sweat, work and tears just to stay away from the food? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Yes. This year, I am going to have smaller portions, and I have also told some of the chefs in the family about Dr. Ro's book and some recipes where she substitutes better nutritious things out for you. Instead of using the pork and the greens, she uses a liquid smoke for the same taste and flavor. So, I'm hoping that they are going to incorporate it. They have the information, and I've asked over and over again for them to do that for us, but they'll probably have two different pots of it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : They'll have the fat pot and the not-so-fat pot. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What's been the hardest thing for you about staying focused because it's clear that you have dedication? Ms. ASTRID CHINN : Just getting up and saying no and making sure that the people who are supporting me understand how hard it is. And I also have two children, and I'm trying to make sure that they are going to follow healthy eating lifestyle. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Dr. Ro, you have a book that includes these recipes and these - you and I have talked about things, like look for bright foods, look for the vegetables that have bright colors. What - which one of your favorites ways - you've got this idea of using liquid smoke instead of meat in the greens, is there anything else that comes to mind that might be really appropriate for the holidays? Dr. ROVENIA BROCK (Nutritionist) : I think sweet potatoes. You know, usually, we - one of the staples of a holiday meal like Thanksgiving might include candied sweet potatoes. But instead of using the loaded up sugar, why not try doing some mashed sweet potatoes with a little orange juice, a sprinkle of brown sugar. You could add skim milk if you want that, and reduced trans fat-free margarine. Or you could even bake a casserole, tossing cubes of potatoes in with Granny Smith apples and raisins and unsweetened apple juice for flavor, you know? And you can drizzle a little black strap molasses over that, throw in some cinnamon, all spice and nutmeg; bake it for a nutritious guilt-free side dish. Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : That sounds delicious. Dr. Brock : See? I'm giving you ideas how not\u2026 Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : Yeah. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Beverly, it sounds like you've got a new\u2026 Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : I've got to get that book for one thing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Beverly, when you think about the influence of your health on your self-esteem, you've obviously given some things up. You've given up being able to eat a few things here, a few things there, or maybe more than a few, but what have you gained? Ms. BEVERLY ARNOLD (Resident, Detroit) : Oh, I can tell you, I was an embarrassment. I had became so withdrawn, I didn't like to go out, I didn't get around very well. I ended up having to have a knee replacement, So this is big difference for me. I've come through, I lost weight. I went through the knee replacement. I have - before I gained so much weight, I loved to wear heels because I'm short. And after the knee replacement, I'm back in my heels, but not those tall ones that they're wearing. But I'm back in my heels and the main thing is my self-esteem is gradually - it's getting much better because I've gotten to a point it's - and it was a horrible habit that I'm still having a problem with when I was overweight - extremely overweight - I didn't even weigh myself. I didn't even look in the mirror at myself. So those are some things that I'm still struggling with, and I'd still see myself as a fat person.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Today, we're remembering Robert Kennedy because it was on this day 40 years ago when he won the California Democratic primary, only to be fatally shot after giving a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Among the people with Senator Kennedy that night, the writer and journalist Pete Hamill. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : I was his friend, and it was a mistake to have done that. It's the only time in my long, now, career that I was ever really a friend of a politician. ALEX CHADWICK, host : It was a mistake, Pete Hamill says, because he lost some of the objectivity he needed for journalism. But for Pete Hamill, the son of Irish immigrants, there was something visceral that drew him to Robert Kennedy. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Trying to define a friendship is always difficult, but I felt connected to him in a way. I think that had something to do with the kind of Irish fatalism that was in him. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Kennedy had plenty of reasons to be fatalistic: seeing his brother John shot down in Dallas, watching a war in Vietnam spin out of control, witnessing cities burn after Martin Luther King's assassination two months earlier. And on that evening, here in Los Angeles 40 years ago, there was an aura of hope mixed with the fatalism. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Robert Kennedy was running to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency. Pete Hamill was with the Kennedy campaign that night as they waited for the results of the critical California primary. He says it's hard for young people to understand now, but there were no cell phones, no email, just a lot of people going in and out and bringing bits of news from here and there with them. Bobby Kennedy sat in his shirtsleeves, waiting to learn his fate. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : And he had that fatalistic look still. I think he was prepared to lose, and he was prepared to win. And we were there for a while and finally on the screen came the news that he look - apparently had won the California primary. And he got up to get dressed and get a necktie, and then we all went down in a freight elevator down to the kitchen. And he went out and he did an off-the-cuff speech that was wonderfully - talking and funny, and he hoped that Don Drysdale, the pitcher from the Dodgers, was going to part of this team since he had pitched his sixth straight shutout, which is incomprehensible to the modern baseball. And he made a joke about Sam Yorty not being able to come - who was the mayor of Los Angeles and hated Kennedy. Among other things, he wouldn't provide police protection. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : And after thanking everybody and his wife and the usual people, it was time to leave. And I was in the kitchen, suddenly, along with other reporters, Rosey Greer and George Plimpton, people like that. And he turned at one point because three Mexican chefs or assistants or busboys or something were standing on his left, my right, and he turned to shake hands with one of them - a young guy named Juan Romero (ph). And as he was turned, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang came the shots. Not loud. Not 45s. It was a small- caliber pisto, and then it was just chaos. And there was a struggle with Sirhan for the gun - his arm being lowered enough that the people behind Kennedy were shot in the legs. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Were you struggling for that gun? Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Yeah. I was one of the guys - I didn't have that - my hand on the gun, but I threw a good punch over the shoulder of somebody. And then the reporter instinct took over again, and I was just watching every detail. Looking at everything. Look at the reaction, writing the sounds. And I knew somehow that I'd never talk to him again. He had this smile that was almost accepting, as if to say, OK, this is it. That it had been there all along - again, that fatalism. Don't count on November, you might not get through June. And they took him away. And we all went out to the hospital. My brother Brian (ph) had a car and was driving us and we waited all night; he was still alive. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : We kept getting bulletins about being alive, and he lived for 24 hours and died, again in the early hours. And it was appalling for it to have happened again. It was something that I - maybe some of us including me, might have said, gee, what if this happens again? But we didn't count on it, it didn't seem possible, although the killing of Martin Luther King made you worry about it all the time. And then here it was. And we left around just before dawn. My brother Brian, who's a photographer, and somebody else. We dropped someone off. Off we went. I was living in Laguna Beach, and we drove all the way home. I had two young daughters, 5 and 3. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Read that last paragraph, would you? Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Sure. \"Flocks of birds were rising from the darkness. We'd reached the house and I went in and turned on the television set and looked at the latest bulletins. I sat facing the set and the sea. Brian and I drank some whiskey, and then he went off to sleep. I looked up and saw my daughter Adrianne (ph) staring at me in a baffled way. My face must have been a ruin. She came over to me, tears in her eyes, and touched my face. I started to weep for her, for her sister, for my Irish parents, for my friends, for America. Out there, sea to shining sea. I held her tight, wondering what would become of all of us.\" ALEX CHADWICK, host : Pete Hamill, I don't know how you could bear to write that. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Or read it. Forgive me. But that was the feeling, and I think a lot of people had it. A lot of people I knew stopped investing any kind of hope in politics. There were a lot of discussions later - what if this hadn't happened, what if he had been president instead of Nixon. There would have been no Watergate, the war would be over fast, etc. But they were all the great what ifs of history. Mr. PETE HAMILL (Writer and Journalist; Friend of Senator Robert Kennedy) : Today, there are people who are 40 years old walking past me on 42nd Street who never heard of Robert Kennedy. He was a great \"perhaps\" as far as our politics was concerned. And yet the voice for some of us echoes across those decades, and we still worry about the people who run and about our country. I mean, one of the things that was true of the Kennedy campaign was that you could oppose a president, oppose his policies, not because you hated America, but because you loved America. And I think the love they had for America is finding new form now. People who are saying, we're better than this. And if that happens, then the spirit of Kennedy might be alive among people who'd never heard of them. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Writer Pete Hamill. He's written the introduction to a new book, \"A Time It Was: Bobby Kennedy In The Sixties,\" by photographer Bill Eppridge. Pete Hamill, thank you. \n\n ###",

This week, we're looking at the minimum wage because it's on its way up to $15 an hour in California and New York, which is an unprecedented wage bump at the state level. And it's going to have an effect both on workers and employers. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has more. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Shopping these days is a little easier on Edica Reese's wallet. She works as a cashier at a McDonald's in New York City, where the minimum wage is on the rise. EDICA REESE : It's helping. I guess I can get more essentials. Before, I couldn't get what I needed. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Sometimes she would have to ask neighbors for toilet paper when she ran out. But now she and other fast-food workers in the city are making at least 10.50 an hour. That's set to go up to $12 an hour at the end of the year. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : And that means she can afford to keep up her own stock of toiletries. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Are you finished shopping? EDICA REESE : Yes, I am. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : But it's going to be a while before the minimum wage finally hits the planned $15 an hour. That's because the wage hikes in New York state and California are being phased in with small bumps every year. Reese says 15 an hour would make a big difference for her and her 3-year-old daughter. EDICA REESE : I guess I could pay my bills on time instead of waiting for the next check to come and the next check. I live check to check still. I need to save a little bit more money, you know? HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : For a full-time worker, a year's salary at 15 an hour, before taxes, adds up to just over $31,000. And some employers say they're not sure how they're going to afford it, including Kurt Samuels. He owns Family's Pots and Grill, a Jamaican restaurant in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where, at 5:30 in the morning, he starts making... KURT SAMUELS : Brown stew chicken, curry goat, oxtail, and soon I'll have some jerk chicken ready. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : This is all for the lunch rush? KURT SAMUELS : For the lunch rush. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : Samuels has one part-time employee who helps take orders. She's currently making the minimum wage, and he says when it goes up... KURT SAMUELS : It's going to be hard, you know? Maybe her hours most likely going to be cut, you know, 'cause the end of the day, got to pay the rent, pay the bills, the gas, light, insurance. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : He recently raised prices, but he's worried about losing customers if he does it again. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : A few blocks away, Miesha Stokley is trying to figure out how to keep staffing her cupcake shop. She has one minimum-wage worker who helps with baking. MIESHA STOKLEY : She's definitely worth minimum wage, so I can't argue with that. I just have to, you know, work harder so we can make more money and I'll be able to pay. But I don't argue with it because it's expensive to live in New York. HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE : For now, Stokley's putting more hours in herself at Cupcake Cutie Boutique. MIESHA STOKLEY : I work nights as a nurse. So I'm here in the morning and the afternoon, and then I go to work at night. \n\n ###",

And Merriam-Webster noticed. The dictionary has been using its Twitter account to report what words people have been searching for most and to clear up any misconceptions. I learned, for instance, that unproud is in fact a word. Peter Sokolowski is a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster, and he joins us now from our member station WFCR to tell us how the 2016 election is affecting our vocabulary. Hi, Peter. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : How are you? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I am doing well. So many words. So many words. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : (Laughter). RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So let's get through some of these. You've been tracking on your Twitter feed what words people look up most during debates. So what was trending on Wednesday night during the last presidential debate? PETER SOKOLOWSKI : Without question, the winner was bigly and hombre, those two words which were used by Donald Trump or apparently used by Donald Trump. I think he actually said big league. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thank you, because I maintain that he actually said big league. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : Yeah. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Two separate words, not bigly. But... PETER SOKOLOWSKI : Sure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...Apparently, I'm alone. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : No, you're not. Linguists have discussed this and have studied it. And in fact, it does seem that he said big league. Part of the reason is our ears are keyed in a certain way. We're English speakers, and we don't expect to hear big league used as an adverb. That was the odd piece of it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's true. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : And so we naturally think bigly with that L-Y ending, which does, you know, cue the adverb. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Huh. What else were people looking for? PETER SOKOLOWSKI : Well, hombre is interesting in the sense that people didn't know how to spell it. So one of the things that we see online is the different attempts that are made. So they landed on ombre, O-M-B-R-E, which is the French word for shadow. It's also the name for, I think, a card game or something in English, which is why it's there. And also umber with a U, which is, of course, the color. And so they landed on these different pages kind of searching for the correct word, which reminds me of Aleppo. There's a combining form, lepo-, L-E-P-O, which people landed on because Aleppo is the name of a city, which is also in the dictionary, but people didn't know how to spell it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Ah. So people were just searching for lepo- instead of... PETER SOKOLOWSKI : Yeah. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...Aleppo. Got you. PETER SOKOLOWSKI : One thing that I have found with - especially with debates in real-time is that people look up words that are very surprising. For example, people look up the word debate itself at the very beginning of debates and the word moderator. And sometimes I get feedback on Twitter - for example, people will say, you know, boy, I really feel sorry for the American public if they don't know what debate means. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's Tuesday and time for Africa Update. This week, we take a look at how Africa's oil affects the cost of gas in America. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Plus, a former Congolese militia leader goes on trial; the charge: recruiting and training child soldiers. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more we've got Edmond Keller. He's director of the Globalization Research Center on Africa at the University of California, Los Angeles. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome, professor. Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Thank you. I'm glad to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yes, I'm glad to have you right here in the room with me. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, in the past two weeks, the average price for a gallon of gas in the U.S. has jumped to more than $3. The cost of a barrel of oil was nearly a hundred dollars. Mideast oil might come to mind, but Americans also used millions of barrels of oil imported from Africa every day, so what percent of U.S. oil consumption comes from the continent? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, presently, it's about 17 or 18 percent, and that tops the Middle East oil that we import which is about 16 percent. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What regions, what nations are we talking about from Africa? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, for the most part, we're talking about states that border the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa although there have been rich oil deposits discovered in Sudan and in Chad, but we don't do business in Sudan because there are sanctions against that government. We also get some oil from Algeria, and Libya has deposits as well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You mentioned Sudan. China has not been shy about going to them for oil, have they? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Not at all. As a matter of fact, China imports about 40 to 50 percent of its oil from Sudan right now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now you talk about something that you termed the resource curse. What's that? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, the resource curse has to do with the boom of some discovery of mineral deposits such as oil and natural gas. And what's happened in the past is that countries that have such a boom tend to neglect other sectors of their economy such as agriculture. And in Africa, that's critical because in Africa, the population growth outstrips agricultural production, and there's always a need for importing food. So the curse has to do with that neglect of other sectors of the economy. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So it sounds like you're saying that people who are in these oil-rich nations may not actually see a lot of that wealth. Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Absolutely, they won't. Oftentimes what happens is if there's a certain amount of corruption - official and unofficial - some political officials tend to scrape off the profits from this oil in sort of a rent-seeking kind of behavior. And, of course, they don't tax their citizens very heavily, so the citizens don't have leverage against the government to make them behave more responsibly. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, who then gets the money? Dr. EDMOND KELLER (Professor of Political Science and Director of Globalization Research Center on Africa, University of California, Los Angeles) : Well, the money goes to corrupt politicians and in places like the Niger Delta right now. There's a great deal of political-slash-criminal activity related to the oil production in the Niger Delta. There are groups that claim to be fighting for self-determination, but at the same time, what they do is tap into these oil pipelines, skim off oil and - you know, last year they earned about $1.5 billion in this way, and they take this money and they pump it into the acquisition of more and more weapons, fast boats that operate on the high seas, and in that way they are able to kidnap oil workers and people involved in that industry, but offshore. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What comes to mind for me is the whole idea of conflict diamonds and it sounds as if so many of the resources on the continent of Africa become embroiled in these contests for power. \n\n ###",

She says she's always been passionate about the word. But that passion didn't necessarily include lyrics to music. Then one day, Barnett came across the work of singer/songwriter Abbey Lincoln. The artist's way of storytelling opened up a whole new world. Ms. ABBEY LINCOLN (Artist) : (Singing) I think about the life I lived, figure made of clay. I think about the things I loved, the things I gave away. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : I saw this album and picked it up. I had never heard of her, and it blew me away. From there, it just sort of snowballed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It got LaShonda Katrice Barnett thinking about female songwriters. Do black women bring something different to songwriting? LaShonda interviewed more than 40 female musicians about the process of creating songs. She's turned that into a book titled \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft.\" Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Farai, I think that the image of a black woman stepping on stage up to a microphone is a very common image. And I think when comparing female musicianship to male musicianship, the ideals that it's somehow less serious. And I don't know if that's because in our society, we are sort of naturally trained to look at women as caregivers, as nurturers, as an emotional or at least, as being more than - more emotional than men. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : I was teaching a course at Jazz Lincoln Center spring of 2006 and we had one evening, a one two-hour session, to devote to Billie Holliday, which is not enough time, of course. But I remember at the end of the class, feeling very down because the students were very, very interested in Holliday as this tragic figure. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Had questions about her lovers and her drug abuse and various things that I'm thinking to myself and I tried to shift the conversation a couple of times, but I remember thinking that it's too bad that we can't really focus on a conversation about her musicianship. The fact that, you know, she was also a songwriter. She penned the lyrics to \"Don't Explain,\" which has been covered many times. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : That's actually one of my favorite songs. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : But that didn't come up during the course of our two-hour conversation. And that really did stay with me. I think I wrote the proposal for the book a couple of weeks after that incident. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you decided to interview people to go to the source, musicians, you interviewed the legendary Nina Simone. How was that? Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : It was slaving(ph). I was awestruck. I interviewed Ms. Simone by a telephone in June of '99. And, Farai, my palms are sweating so much I could barely maintain my grip on the receiver. It was amazing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give me a moment from that. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : I was a little bit surprised by the fact that Ms. Simone seemed very interested in sort of getting the legacy, getting her musical legacy down. And as I listened to her, I realized that she was merely trying to make the point that there are all these anecdotes about me as being the defiant one, but I'm a musician. I'm a classically trained pianist. I take my craft very, very seriously. I'm at the piano six to eight hours a day. And I just remember thinking, you know, I wished that we could talk more about her songs. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : But Simone was on another page, she was just wanted to really drive home the fact that she is very serious musician, which is, of course, nobody would doubt. All it takes is one listen to anything that Simone ever recorded and you come away with that. Ms. NINA SIMONE (Jazz Artist) : (Singing) My skin is black. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : This is her song, \"Four Women.\" Ms. NINA SIMONE (Jazz Artist) : (Singing) My arms are long. My hair is wooly. My back is strong, strong enough to take the pain. It's been inflicted again and again. What do they call me? My name is Aunt Sarah. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let's just skip around a little bit in genre. You have Angelique Kidjo. She does not generally sing in English, although she started to. What did she have to say about that? Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Actually, Farai, that was the last question that I asked her. I asked her to speculate as she would about her popularity in America. Because, as you pointed out, she doesn't sing in English on most of her albums. She records in Yoruba. She records in Fon, Portuguese, French, but rarely English. And she said, well, you know, like music is a universal language. And I think that people are responding to something else in my voice. There's an emotional connection to that. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : And I believe she's absolutely right. One of my favorite songs is (unintelligible). And I have no idea what the song is about. But the first time I heard it, my heart was enthralled. I just couldn't get over the beauty of the song. \n\n ###",

People like Chaka Khan, for example. Ms. CHAKA KHAN (Singer) : (Singing) I will love you anyway even if you cannot stay. I think you are the one for me. Here is where you ought to be. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What did you learn about her approach to songwriting? Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : It's very interesting to talking to Chaka because she sees herself as a conduit for the music. She was not willing to dissect and analyze the music on a certain level. She was more interested in getting out the idea that you have to come to the music very humble. Ms. CHAKA KHAN (Singer) : (Singing) Oh sweet thing. Don't you know you're my everything? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, there's a story behind \"Sweet Thing.\" Tell us (unintelligible). Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Yes, absolutely. I asked what inspired that and she said that she was sitting around with Tony Maiden. And that she and Tony wrote the song together. And I said, okay, but who inspired the song? Who were you thinking about? And she laughed and she said, girl, I think I told all my boyfriends at the time that that song was about them. But the song was really about Tony. And then she started talking about the wonderful, a musical chemistry that she had with Tony and, you know - the fact that the song was written in less than five minutes, just blows me away because that's an R&B staple. That would be with us forever. Ms. CHAKA KHAN (Singer) : (Singing) Oh, sweet thing. Ms. JOAN ARMATRADING (Artist) : (Singing) Oh the feeling when you're reeling. You step lightly thinking you're number one. Down to zero with a word. Leaving for another one. Now you walk with your feet back on the ground down to the ground, down to the ground. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There are also people who were format breakers like Joan Armatrading. And she said it is something about the songs that demand that the lyrics be as poetic as the notes you strum together. Talk about what you got from the interview with her. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : I wasn't surprised, first of all, to learn that Joan Armatrading wrote limericks or poems as a youth because anybody who studies her lyrics, you can - the poetry just leaps at you from the page. I was really taken aback by the work that she puts into meshing or fusing the music with the lyrics - and the way that she was able to speak so eloquently about it. Well, just the fact that, you know, she's in her mid-50s, but she's still very open and still embracing lots of different ideas and fusing them at her music. It was very inspiring because she still opens her mind. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Was there any difference you found between the people who might be 60s and above and the people who might be 40s and below? Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Well, the major thing that I noticed is that in the diamond group, that's the older group, they're very, very concerned with the state of black music today and they spoke about that at me. But some of that I kept in the book and other pieces I kept out. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : But with the younger artists, they talked about the fact that there was a shift in the music that nowadays, for example, you'd be hard pressed to find whole families listening to the same music. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Brenda Russell spoke about this and Dianne Reeves. And they remembered fondly, you know, the time when they were growing up how moms and fathers and grandmothers and cousins - everybody was enjoying the same music and how - that's sadly missing. They see a lot of that in today's culture. So that was one thing that really struck home with me. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, LaShonda, thank you so much. Ms. LaSHONDA KATRICE BARNETT (Author, \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft\") : Thank you very much for having me. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : LaShonda Katrice Barnett teaches creative writing and jazz history at Sarah Lawrence College. Her book is \"I Got Thunder: Black Women Songwriters and Their Craft.\" Ms. DIANNE REEVES (Singer) : (Singing) I am an endangered species but I sing no victim's song. I am a woman. I am an artist. I know where my voice belongs. I am an endangered species but I sing no victim's song. I am a woman. I am an artist. I know where my voice belongs. I am a woman. I exist. I shake my fist but not my hips. My skin is dark my body is strong. I sign of rebirth no victim's song. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : That's our show for today. And thank you for sharing your time with us.

He's an assistant professor of business and public policy at The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Wolfers, welcome. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Pleasure to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So there have been a bunch of new articles analyzing research on the death penalty, arguing that there is a deterrent effect. How do you process the debate at this stage over whether the death penalty is a deterrent? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : I think the debate, so far, has been actually quite conclusive, but conclusive about proving that the empirical evidence here is very inconclusive. The truth is, after poring over the data, it's just plain very hard to know. And, Farai, let me give you an intuition for that. You know, I'm - I do a lot of statistics and econometrics, and normally, I would - I like to tell people that statistics can help solve many of our problems. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : This is a case where, if you think about, say, a state like California, the number of homicides that occurs in California in any given year - it could be two and half thousand one year, one and a half thousand the next, 3,000 the year after, so it's not only a very, very high number, but it goes up and down a whole heck of a lot - then if you can think about the number of executions that occurs in California, it'll be one execution one year, three the next, zero the next, and if one were looking to see, say, as many as the proponents claim that each execution deterrs, say, four homicides, then they're looking to explain a very, very small proportion of the ups and down in the homicide data. And so trying to sort out which of the ups and downs are due to prison policy, which are due to police, which are due to variation in executions just turned out to be an incredibly difficult task. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm thinking here, thought, specifically of the research by Roy Adler and Michael Summers who looked at U.S. executions between 1979 and 2004, compared those to murders the year after the executions, and they found that executions - when the executions increases, the number of people murdered dropped off. Are you saying that that's just a statistical anomaly? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Yes. It's no coincidence that their work was published in the Wall Street Journal which has a very political editorial board. So just to clarify for your listeners, they looked at the aggregate number of homicides in the U.S. year-to-year, and they found that it went up when the number of executions went down. If you looked at an earlier sample the previous 50 years, you, in fact, find the opposite. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Or an alternative, you could take the same approach and look at what happened to the homicide rate in states that actually had zero executions and it turns out, in states that don't have the death penalty, the murder rate over the last 40 years has pretty much moved in walk step as with states that do have the death penalty, suggesting that the difference between the two, there isn't much of a difference between the two and, therefore, not much that the death penalty can explain. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So when you think about these professors publishing an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, and you mentioned that they are highly politicized. They're considered by many to be a very, very highly politicized conservative op-ed page, what does that do to the court of public opinion? How much do things like op-eds and academic studies have to do with how people actually legislate and how courts actually make decisions? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : The public certainly look to academics to try and sort out some of these questions, like does the death penalty deter. The only people who have the - or the people who have the largest appetite to try to answer the public on that, unfortunately, are those with ideological opinions which, often, they'll dress up as science. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : You can go back to the 2000 presidential election debates when President Bush was asked if he was for or against the death penalty and why. He said he was for it because he believed in deterrence, but he actually made an even stronger statement, which is he said he thought that was the only reason to be for it. If that's the case, then there really should be greater scientific effort in trying to understand what really is going on with respect to deterrence. Unfortunately, of course, at the moment, I think the scientists are a little too infected with ideology. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about the debate over methods of execution like lethal injection, which is currently being examined as to whether or not it is cruel or whether it's efficient? What's the status of that debate in your mind, and how much does that influence the general debate over executions? Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : I think there's essentially two debates there. One is a legal debate - and this is the debate, literally, the Supreme Court's having, which is: Is the method of - is lethal injection cruel and unusual punishment, which is prohibited by the Constitution? There I'd simply defer to the doctors, you know, this is not a domain that you would want economists or statisticians wandering in. There is a second question which is : Would different methods be better or worse at deterring criminals? And, again, here, the evidence is not very useful, but I think its, at the very least(ph), introspection would suggest, if there were such a thing as a deterrent effect and therefore if one were on the pro-death penalty side, presumably, we would then want the method of execution to, not only be painful, but public because that would maximize, I would guess, the deterrent effect. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You're talking beheadings-in-the-courtyard type of executions. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : This is the logical conclusion from the view that what we're trying to do with the death penalty is deterrence. Yeah. Again, it's very hard for the evidence to speak one way or the other on that, and I think there's nothing particularly credible that can be said one way or the other. There's an interesting legal issue here as well with the two in effect. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : In the 1977 decision examining whether - by the Supreme Court reinstating the death penalty - or it might have been the '72 decision suspending the death penalty - the question of whether execution was cruel and unusual punishment came up, and at least one of the justices was of the view that if executing a criminal did not have a deterrent effect, then that would necessarily makes it cruel and unusual, and so that's a way in which the deterrence debate can speak to some of those questions that are arising. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Professor Wolfers, thank you so much. Dr. JUSTIN WOLFERS (Assistant Professor, Business and Public Policy, The Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania) : Thank you.

And this is NEWS & NOTES. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Donda West will be buried in Oklahoma City today. The mother of rapper Kanye West died earlier this month, a day after having cosmetic surgery. Coroners are still looking for the cause of her death. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Besides being Kanye's mom, Donda West was also a professor and administrator at Chicago State University. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just two days before her death, Professor West did one of her last interviews. She spoke with freelance journalist and college student Souleo. His story will appear in the January issue of Sister 2 Sister magazine. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Souleo joins me now. Welcome. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Thank you. How are you today? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. So you're a senior at Brown University. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Yes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Snagging this interview must have been a huge deal. Why did you want to speak with Donda West? SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : It was a very huge deal. Before (unintelligible), I just want to offer my condolences to Kanye West and the West family and all those affected. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : And to answer your question, I wanted the interview because she - I knew that she was very involved with the Kanye West Foundation. She reveals in the interview that this was, you know, one of her deepest passions. And I wanted to talk to her about her work, the foundation, and the sort of issue that she was aiming to address with it. And the interview request was put in six months prior to November 8th. So this was, you know, a long time, you know, coming, you know, waiting for the interview, and I'm happy that I did get speak to her, though. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And that foundation deals with the issue of education and dropout prevention, sometimes using music to try to encourage kids to stay engaged. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Definitely. Their first initiative and program was Loop Dreams, which Kanye and his mom, Dr. West, were going - that was to be the first initiative. And that was basically to educate children about the music business, behind the scenes, about music production, to really inspire them to get motivated and to address issues within education as well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you conducted the interview over the telephone. What could you tell about her personality? How did she strike you as you did the interview? SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Wow. She - it was an amazing conversation. It was over a half an hour long. And she just seemed to have such a warm and caring spirit. She was graceful. She was kind. She was wise. She was highly intelligent and she was focused and deeply passionate. So she just struck me as, you know, just a great, awesome, mother-figure. And, you know, she even reminded me of my own mother who passed away this year in February. So it was sort of, like, I was speaking to my mom in a sense because they just had a similar loving spirit. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Having gone through what you just went through, Kanye West apparently broke down during a recent concert in Europe. Can you empathize with what he's going through right now? SOULEO (Senior Student, Brown University; Freelance Journalist) : Oh, my god. I can empathize 100 percent - even more. You know, I can totally empathize with what he's going through. At the same time, no one knows what he's going through. Because when you're living in the moment of mourning and of pain, it's really personal and really deep. And so I think all we can do is just offer our support and our love to him. And - but I certainly know there's confusion, there's pain. For me, it was just, you know, in some ways, it almost hasn't hit me completely. So there's a long process to go through when you're mourning. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Donda West also wrote a book about raising her famous son. And you talked to her about the challenges of raising kids today. She mentioned teen pregnancy, materialism, the Internet. \n\n ###",

Rather than releasing an entire album all at once, they're releasing one song on the last Friday of each month. And they're calling the project Rave of the Month.

SUNE ROSE WAGNER : Thank you. SHARIN FOO : Hi. Thanks. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The song we're hearing right now is called \"The World Is Empty (Without You).\" This was the first song you released for the project. This is back in January of this year. Are these things that are just kind of coming up organically in that month? Are you setting strict writing parameters? Are there things you've had on the shelf for a while? SUNE ROSE WAGNER : I'm not the best at having too much time to work on things, so... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...You need a deadline, Sune? SUNE ROSE WAGNER : Yeah, I need a deadline, so I usually wait. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sharin, how do you feel about that, Sune's procrastination? SHARIN FOO : Yeah, this is an ongoing discussion in the band because, you know, I get a track, you know, five hours before it has to be delivered, which, you know - but I suppose I've gotten used to it. And this has become a very Raveonettes way of working, which is sort of spur-of-the-moment, very stream-of-consciousness way. And I sort of hate it and like it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You sound resigned. Although I imagine there is a kind of freedom to that. You don't have to overthink things. SHARIN FOO : Yeah. SUNE ROSE WAGNER : Well, it's - the whole idea is that it's hard to make decisions sometimes. You know, it's like when you go to a restaurant and they have, you know, 10 pastas that sound really good but you just wait till the waiter gets there and you just pick one. And it's kind of like the same thing. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I get that, the paralysis of too many choices, totally. SUNE ROSE WAGNER : Yeah. SHARIN FOO : But there is a wonderful freedom in this project, which is that nothing has to be cohesive. And it's really like a blank slate. SUNE ROSE WAGNER : Yeah.

And we head north now to Maine, a state where the outcome is not really in doubt. Unless the polls are dead wrong, Hillary Clinton is expected to carry Maine, which raises the question - what was Donald Trump doing there yesterday? We've got Steve Mistler on the line to help answer that question. He's the chief political reporter for Maine Public Radio. Good morning, Steve. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : We are glad to have you on our air. So Trump held a rally yesterday in Bangor, in a state that polls indicate leans blue, as we said. Why is that a good use of his time? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Well, some models of Trump's path to the White House include him winning Maine's 2nd Congressional District. And that means it could get - it could have an outsized role in the election if Trump actually carries some of the bigger swing states. It's the largest district east of the Mississippi, and it's historically been purple. Voters have sent Democrats and Republicans to Congress. But the district has also undergone some changes that have made it shade red in the last several years. There's been paper mills that have closed and manufacturing jobs have left. It's older, whiter, rural and fewer people with college degrees than the more liberal 1st District. So if the prevailing analysis of Trump voters is correct, it's really in his sweet spot. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : We should give people a little Maine politics tutorial here, I guess. Maine has four electoral votes and three of the four are generally considered safe for Democrats. But that fourth, that 2nd District vote that you're talking about, that's the one that maybe is looking like a toss-up now. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Yeah, that's right. There were some polls early in mid-September that showed Trump with a decent lead or just ahead of Clinton. That means he's poised to do something that nobody here has done since Maine changed how it allocated its electoral votes in 1969, and that's to split the electoral votes. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Can you identify what the factors are that may be driving that? What's shifted? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Well, some of the things I just mentioned, which... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...The paper mills. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Yeah, that's - I think that's part of it. I mean, it was - five mills have closed in the last two years. And that means that a lot of good-paying jobs have left. And so people are either underemployed or they're not making what they used to. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : What about how this specific campaign is playing out? For example, the controversy that has dominated this week of the question over Trump's treatment of women. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Well, that remains to be seen, how that does play out. I mean, he was at a rally in Bangor yesterday. And he discussed that, but not with the same specificity that he has at other rallies. He didn't mention his accusers by name, and he just said the accusations were lies perpetrated by the media. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : One factor - the governor of Maine, Paul LePage, is Republican. And he has been outspoken all through this campaign season in his support of Trump. Does he remain so? And how much weight does his voice carry? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : He does remain an ardent supporter of Trump. And his voice does carry a lot of weight in the 2nd District, which he has carried twice in his first two elections here. And in fact, Trump parroted many of the things that the governor talks about quite frequently, which is welfare, the loss of manufacturing jobs and the heroin crisis. At the same time, the governor's very controversial. And he's made national headlines in a negative way twice since September. And incidentally, he was not at Trump's rally yesterday. And he had introduced him at the three previous rallies that Trump has held here. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : In just a few sentences, Steve Mistler, what are you watching for? What are you keeping your eye on with these last three weeks to go? STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : Well, what I really would like to know is whether the - I mean, Ted Cruz won here and Bernie Sanders won here... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...In the primaries. STEVE MISTLER, BYLINE : That's correct. And we're - what we're waiting to see is whether those voters move to the respective Republican and Democratic candidates. And Bernie Sanders was here last week basically making the case that Trump is too dangerous. And I think perhaps that he's making a stronger case than Trump has so far to the Catholics, who really punch above their weight in Maine and in terms of turning out to vote.

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Twenty years ago, Chicago lost one of the city's most beloved mayors, Harold Washington. In 1983, Washington became the first African-American to run the windy city. Washington brought a wave of changes to the city. Under his motto fairer than fair, he increased minority business contracts and opened the Chicago budget process to public input. He was reelected in 1987 but never finished his second term that's because Washington died from a massive heart attack at the age of 65. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : The city of Chicago is celebrating Washington's legacy. Here to talk more about the late mayor is Washington's former deputy press secretary, Laura Washington, no relation. Today, Laura is a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a professor at DePaul University. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : Hi, Farai. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's great to talk to you. So his win was considered an upset. What was the political and racial climate like in Chicago when he ran for mayor in 1983? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : Well, the city has always been very segregated, you know, Farai, and it remains that way today. The Democratic Party establishment, the machine that was established by Richard J. Daley, was in full swing and, basically, was a party of exclusion.  Most of the folks that ran the city, most of the mayors that ran the city had been pretty much taking care of business for the white community, and African-Americans and Latinos, in particular, felt really left out of the system. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : So when Harold Washington came along, this was actually his second run at the mayor's race. He, I think, responded and struck a chord in these communities to people who sort of like it's our turn. It's our time to get an opportunity to sit in city hall. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I understand he didn't get a lot of press. First of all, explain why. And, secondly, if that was the case, what did he use to win? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : The media was pretty much tied in to the same old, the way city hall had been running again the Democratic Party establishment. They didn't - most folks - and they covered politics then and even today - are white and didn't have a lot or little bit handle on what was going on in communities of color. So they didn't see Harold Washington coming. He had run before. He was a well established, very popular black congressman on the south side of Chicago. They didn't really know him very well. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : There were a couple of other people in the race. One was Mayor Daley's son, Richard, and who's the current mayor - and who is not the current mayor - and Jane Byrne, who was the mayor at the time. And they were really focused on them. It was a three-way race, and Harold Washington snuck up right behind them and came in to win. I think the way he did it was by igniting a movement. There was a lot of unhappiness with the way government had been run, the exclusionary practices of Jane Byrne. So he tapped into that. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : I remember sitting down - I covered the mayor in his candidacy before I went to work for him. I remember sitting down with his campaign manager, Al Rabie(ph) and asking, you know, your organization is pretty much nonexistent. You don't have the money. You don't have the staff. You don't have the organization. How do you expect to win? And what Rabie said me is, we're not running a campaign, we're running a movement. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, he was someone who made it clear that he wanted change. He talked about this in his 1983 victory speech. Let's listen. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : We fought it with unseasoned weapons\u2026 Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : \u2026and a phalanx of people who mostly had never been involved in a political campaign before. This has truly been a pilgrimage. I definitely will be moving forward as well, including more people and more kinds of people than any government in the history of Chicago. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Chicago has been famous for its patronage system, sometimes decried for its patronage system. When Harold Washington came in, he brought people in but some other people must have had to go. What did that do to the city? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : It tore the city, and particularly city hall, apart. He declared, the day he was inaugurated, he declared war on the Democratic Party machine. He said, you know, days - work for a day's pay. We're going to bring in new people. We're going to open up the government to the entire city and that was the declaration of war to the machine. So the folks and the machine really dug their heels in and made sure that he couldn't get anything passed. He brought in a lot of new people, but they were mainly through what they call Shakman-exempt positions or political appointments that he had control over. Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : He couldn't do much about the folks who were there and, of course, the folks who were in the government were sabotaging him left and right, but he was able to - by executive order. He couldn't get anything passed to the city council because he didn't have the majority. The white majority fought him tooth and nail. But he was able to get a lot done through executive orders. And actually, in many ways, just by going directly to some of the white aldermen's constituents, the folks that were not voting on the policies and practices that were going to be good for their community, made sure he got the word out through the media and just on his own to tell them, look, you should talk to your representatives. They're not representing you well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, he died from a massive heart attack while sitting at his desk in city hall. He never got to serve out his second term. Some people think there was foul play behind his death. What do you think about that? Professor LAURA WASHINGTON (Columnist, Chicago Sun-Times; DePaul University) : Yeah, that's why those old rumors that just won't die even after 20 years. The reason for that is that he, you know, the man was larger than life. He had so much energy. He worked 14 hours a day. He was always on the street. And that morning, the morning he died, he had been out at a groundbreaking, he'd been his usual jolly self. He went back to his office, was sitting and talking to his press secretary and he fell over on the desk. By the time they got him to the hospital, he probably was already dead. \n\n ###",

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I'm Alex Chadwick. \"The Greatest Manhunt of World War II\" - part of the subtitle of a new book that tells the unbelievable true story of a GI on the run in the jungles of Burma. Sex, drugs, murder, race, the story keeps unfolding to a very dark end. We know Brendan Koerner from Slate.com \"Now the Hell Will Start\" is his first book. Brendan, hi. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Hey, thanks for having me, Alex. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So this is the story of a man named Herman Perry. Who was he? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : He was an ordinary guy. He was a young African-American meat cutter from Washington D.C. who was drafted into the army in 1942. Shipped off to the Indo-Burmese border region to work on the Ledo Road, which was a military highway that was being built from north-east India across northern Burma, and then linking up the old Burma road and China, to keep Nationalist China supplied during the war. ALEX CHADWICK, host : That was a huge project and undertaking, and one that was extremely difficult. You write about the circumstances of this place - just brutal. Leeches, disease, terrible heat, humidity, rain, mud and the headhunters. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : And the headhunters. These were the Naga. This is an ethnic group, a multi-tribal ethnic group that lives up and down the Indo-Burmese border in the hills there. And this was a tribe renowned and feared for its practice of headhunting. It really was the linchpin of society at the time. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So these people are all over the hills. Also tigers, snakes, a lot of dangerous things. But maybe the worst part of daily life for the soldiers like Herman Perry - this is an all-black kind of construction brigade that he's in - are these racist white officers. I mean they have a very difficult time there. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah. This is a segregated army during World War II, you have to keep in mind. Many, many black soldiers were consigned to labor battalions because the War Department really bought into the racial science of the day, thinking that black soldiers weren't necessarily fit for combat. So most black soldiers were consigned to these kind of menial, manual labor chores and often to the worst assignments, the Ledo Road being one of them. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, Herman Perry snaps after months and months and months working on this road, very bad conditions. He's being maybe harassed or maybe disciplined, by a white lieutenant. And Herman Perry shoots him, kills him and runs for the forest. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah, that's right. The other factor in this is that he'd also been coming off an all-night opium vendor, and that's why he'd missed the call of reveille in the morning. And so he'd been placed under arrest, actually. And he'd been to the stockade once before and had a very horrific experience there. They use very extreme punishments on the inmates in the stockade in India. So when he learned that he's was going to be under arrest once more and heading back to the stockade, he just absolutely snapped, and ends up shooting this white lieutenant who was unarmed, I should add, to death, on Ledo Road. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So he goes into the forest. He's just got the clothes that he's wearing, nothing else. And what happens? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Well, first he actually wanders back into camp. After three days he kind of goes through a dissociative episode and kind of forgets what happens. He goes back to camp as if nothing had happened. And he learns, much to his horror, that he had killed this white lieutenant, and there was this 1000 rupee price on his head. He has a rifle with him, and his friends give him a few tins of food. And he starts running. But he realizes pretty early on during his flight that he has to find a place to settle down permanently, or he'll never make it in the jungle. And one day he's walking along a stream up on the Pa-kai(ph) mountains and he sees the glimpse of this peaked longhouse with palm fronds and he starts walking towards it. And this is the village where he kind of reinvents himself as a member of the Naga tribe. ALEX CHADWICK, host : How is it that this black American GI, on the run, and really being pursued by the army, how is he able to ingratiate himself with a tribe of headhunters living in this remote village in the mountains of Burma? Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : On the most basic level, bribery. He actually enlisted the aid of some fellow, sympathetic soldiers, African-American soldiers, who stole rations for him, especially a tin fruit cocktail. And the Nagas love this, not just for the food, but also for the tin. They didn't really have lightweight metals. He also had an M-1 rifle. The Nagas just had spears and swords, and so the rifle came in very handy for hunting. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : But I think the other aspect is just his personality. I interviewed his sister. And the thing that came up again and again about Herman is just he's a very, very charming man. He really had the gift of gab. And he picked up some of the tribal language while working on the roads. He really used that to his advantage, in becoming a member of this tribe. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And Herman stays on in this village, he meets the daughter of the - I guess of the village or clan chief. And they fall in love and he marries her. They have a child - I mean, I'm thinking - no, Brendan's got to be making this up, right? I mean what a story! Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah, it's such a story. And there are many times in researching it I thought I'm going to hit a brick wall here, it can't really get any more incredible. And if it does become more incredible, there's no way I can verify that these things actually happened. But every time I surprised myself and found a way to fact check myself and to verify that these events actually took place. And a lot of that is actually just in official army documentation from his court-martial. ALEX CHADWICK, host : He was court-martialed. This manhunt, the great manhunt did succeed at last. He was caught, he was tried, he was sentenced to death for the murder of this lieutenant. And then - he manages to escape. Mr. BRENDAN KOERNER (Writer, Slate.com) : Yeah, he escapes from Death Row in India. He actually lucked out in that the appeals process was held up by a variety of kind-of quirks of fortune. So it took a few months for his death sentence to be approved by the military brass. And during that time he was able to plot his escape. \n\n ###",

This week - the financially invisible, meaning people who don't have a credit card or checking or savings account or a credit score, people who are invisible to banks and credit institutions, which can make it hard to get loans for things like a house or a car or a business. Jose Quinonez found a solution to that problem. He is the founder and CEO of the Mission Asset Fund, and he just won a MacArthur Fellowship for his program helping people become financially visible. He joins us now in our studios here in Washington. Thanks so much for coming in. JOSE QUINONEZ : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right, how does this work? You came up with this idea and you called it lending circles. What are these, and how does it help people become financially visible? JOSE QUINONEZ : Right, so in immigrant communities, there's a rich tradition of people coming together to lend and save money. This is an activity that is pretty widespread and it's a pretty global phenomena and has been happening for a millennia. What we did was basically recognize that activity as bonafide financial activity that just needed to be formalized. And the way we did that was we asked people to sign promissory notes so that they can then participate in the program, and then we then report that activity to the credit bureau. So that's how we're helping people build and establish their credit scores by reporting on this activity that's already taking place in the community. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK, so let's back up. So this is an idea where people in an extended family or neighborhood, a community, get together, actually pool their money. JOSE QUINONEZ : Right. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And that creates a fund that then down the road anyone can withdraw from. JOSE QUINONEZ : Well, so let's talk about a typical case. You may have 10 people, and informally it could be your neighbors, could be your, you know, relatives, could be your co-workers. And then they'll all agree to, say, put in a hundred dollars into the pot, so you then collect that thousand dollars. And then they agree on who takes that thousand dollars first, and they do that in rotation until everybody has a chance in getting that thousand dollars. Again, this activity has been going on for millenia. What we did differently was we asked them, OK, well, by signing a promissory note, we basically transformed it from being invisible to being invisible. We transformed it from being informal to being formal so that the financial systems of today can actually recognize that activity. And so we put ourselves in the middle of that transaction, and then we become the loan servicer and then also become the data furnisher to the credit bureaus. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So someone whose only lending experience is through one of these lending circles, now if they went to go get a mortgage... JOSE QUINONEZ : Exactly. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...The bank would recognize that as being a solid credit history. JOSE QUINONEZ : Exactly because in our economy today, you need a credit score to do anything. You need a credit report to rent an apartment. I mean, some places you need a credit report to even get a job. And so without that credit report, it's extremely difficult to actually become a full participant in our economy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The lending circles that you create, are these all circles of people who have to be in the same geographic area or could you connect an individual in San Francisco with another individual in Washington, D.C.? JOSE QUINONEZ : Yeah, well, theoretically we can, and I think in the future we'll do that, but right now we're keeping it very local, you know, because we want that human interaction to happen 'cause that's actually is a very important element to the program. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Why? Why is that so important? JOSE QUINONEZ : Because people, when they come together in what we call, you know, a lending circle formation session, they have to decide on how much. Is it a hundred dollars or $50, $75, $200? And then they'll start to decide who goes first, who goes second, and sometimes they do that by drawing numbers from a hat. And then they negotiate and it's like, oh, I actually need number four because April I need that money for this or I actually want the last number so that I can, you know, save it for a down payment or something. So there's, like, a community conversation about money and they're talking about their goals and aspirations for what they're going to do with this. And then that solidifies it. That gets people more committed. You know, they see each other eye to eye, right, and I think that's one of the elements of our success is, like, we create this human connection across people. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So this grant's a big deal. You get $625,000. JOSE QUINONEZ : Yes. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What are you going to do with that money? JOSE QUINONEZ : Oh, well, you know, I'm going to take my family to Disneyland several times a year, I think. No - why - I, you know, in all seriousness, I, you know, we're going to do more of what we're doing. We're very excited by expanding lending circles throughout the country with - to more communities. And a lot more of those individuals, they just need an opportunity to turn their lives around or to actually continue on with their lives. And so we want to be there to help them. \n\n ###",

SHAUN CORBETT : Hey, what's up? ROB DANCE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Hi. SHAUN CORBETT : Hey, how you doing? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Shaun? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Inside, the owner of the place, a black guy with tattoos on his neck wearing a black baseball hat, is sitting next to a white police officer who's in uniform. They're huddled around the officer's cellphone, watching video from the protests a couple weeks ago after the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What was that? ROB DANCE : Oh, I was just showing him some clips of downtown when we were down there and... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : During the protests? ROB DANCE : ...Having all the problems. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Captain Rob Dance wears his blond hair in a high and tight buzz cut, and he comes in every once in a while for a haircut or just to catch up with the owner Shaun Corbett. Their friendship started out as an experiment based on this theory Shaun had that if police officers knew the people they served - really knew them - it could change behavior on both sides. SHAUN CORBETT : I have yet to see a officer shoot someone that they know or they've had positive encounters with. I am 100 percent certain that if I get pulled over by Rob, he's not going to shoot me in the street. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It was with that in mind that Shaun Corbett started the program he calls Cops and Barbers, and it's a lot of different things. He brings in police officers to schools. He holds pizza dinners with teenage kids and cops from the area. He also just opens his doors to police officers and encourages them to come in and hang out. Shaun Corbett remembers how awkward it was in the beginning, though. SHAUN CORBETT : You probably don't even notice this. I can remember when you first start coming in here, people's kids wouldn't even talk to you. They would go and get right close to their parent when he would come in. Like, they would go just get close to their parent. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : How did that make you feel, Rob? ROB DANCE : Well, I mean, you know, it makes you realize that it doesn't matter how you feel about certain things. Or it doesn't matter how much you are a part of the problem or how little of a part of the problem you are, it's a reality. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what does this kind of dialogue that you want to create, how does it - what does it look like in reality? SHAUN CORBETT : Well, exactly just what you see right here today, what me and Rob were doing before you walked in. We was just - it's conversations. We take the officers from that neighborhood and pair them up with kids from that neighborhood, and we take them out to dinner. That's the first stage. SHAUN CORBETT : And it's actually funny because everybody's sitting there stone-faced. Nobody's saying a word. But by the time the food come out and everybody start eating, you realize that I love Cam Newton. I love Cam Newton. I go to the games every Sunday. You want to come with me? And so it's - it starts the conversation to realize that we're all human. \n\n ###",

ROB DANCE : Well, no, obviously. I mean, I don't think you're ever going to have a hundred percent buy-in. I think that it - one of the main problems when you start talking about race and some of those issues is some of the common things that you hear is, I'm not part of the problem. I don't have a problem with race. That's really where the problem is. ROB DANCE : I'm sending a bunch of young officers that really don't understand, a large group of them at least, some of the historical problems with race, some of the problems that we face in our community - I'm sending them out to address these problems without any knowledge. And when they go out there and then they are faced with people who, many times, dislike them and are frustrated with them because of what's happened in the last 10 years and there are a hundred encounters in the place where they live, the officers are human, too. And for them not to leave at the end of the day feeling frustrated the way that they were treated in the neighborhood, you know, you can have tensions build very, very easily. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Well, let me ask you, Shaun, have you gotten pushback from people in your own community? Neighbors, kids, being like, Shaun, why do you want me to go hang out with cops? And you're just, like, a PR machine for the cops? SHAUN CORBETT : Well, I mean, at first - and that's with anything new. But I think my reputation in the community is strong enough. See, like, I was in the community even before Cops and Barbers. I'm in six years of business, so I've been doing a book bag drives, turkey drives. So generally, when I kind of say something, people are like OK, I don't know. But... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah. SHAUN CORBETT : ...Let's see what happens. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : At one point in our conversation, Shaun Corbett sort of resets, as if to underscore how close he and Captain Rob Dance have become. SHAUN CORBETT : Rob's my guy. Like, he's really my guy. Like, I text him, check in, how you doing? Like, well, OK, I'm going to tell you this story. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Tell it. SHAUN CORBETT : And this is just the funniest thing. Every year I take my kids to - we do the summer family trip. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : He goes on to say that his kids each got to bring friends on this trip. His son's friend came over on a Saturday morning. They packed up the car, but Shaun was renting a car for the long drive, so they drove over to the rental agency and piled into the new rental car. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's evening by the time they're sitting there ready to go, and Shaun looks over at his son's friend and asks him where his bag is. The kid tells him he's left his bag in the trunk of Shaun's car, which is now locked up behind the big gate at the rental agency, which has now closed for the day. Shaun mulls his options. SHAUN CORBETT : My car is locked in the thing. They've been closed for three hours. And so I'm thinking - and I was like, man, I can climb the fence. And then I'm like, OK, that might not go well. So I was like, you know what, let me call Rob. ROB DANCE : Black guy with tattoos on my neck, it's not going to look good if I'm climbing a fence. SHAUN CORBETT : Yeah, so I call Rob and I say, hey, Rob, man, I got a issue. First he laughs. Like, he thought it was, like, the funniest thing. And so he said, well, what time do you want to come? I said, well, about 8 o'clock. So he's like, all right, I'll have somebody there. So when I get there, not only does he have two officers there, he got the sergeant on duty. They got their lights blaring. And literally, the sergeant helps me climb the fence. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Uh-uh. SHAUN CORBETT : Helped me climb the fence. SHAUN CORBETT : I go to the car, get the suitcases out. I'm actually taking the suitcases and handing them to the sergeant on duty over the fence. Like, this is, like, literally some breaking and entering-type situation. So - but the long story short is if I wouldn't have called him, that would have probably been a different situation. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Things feel different in Charlotte. After the death of Keith Lamont Scott and the protests that followed, the past couple of weeks have been traumatic for this city. \n\n ###",

And according to a new report, from Amnesty International, just 10 countries are hosting more than half of them. The report finds that the world's wealthiest nations are doing little to address the refugee crisis, which is the worst one since World War II. Salil Shetty is the secretary general of Amnesty International. He joins me on the line from the BBC in London. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thanks so much for being with us. SALIL SHETTY : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Which countries have taken in the most refugees in this crisis? SALIL SHETTY : The crisis has got two, sort of, broad elements to it. On the one hand, it's, of course, what we see in the Middle East right now. So Syria is really what's been in the news a great deal. But let's not forget that there are some other long-term conflicts and crises, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan. SALIL SHETTY : So if you think about these 10 countries, they're, essentially, the countries which are neighbors to the countries in conflict. So as far as the Syrian crisis is concerned, Turkey is, by far, the largest host for Syrian refugees. But Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, all of these, host very large numbers of Syrian refugees. Eighty-six percent of the Syrian refugees, approximately, are in these neighboring countries. And then, if you look at Sudan, Somalia, then - you know, Kenya is one of the big host countries for the Somalia, Sudanese refugees. Also, if you take Afghanistan, Pakistan would be the single biggest and Iran as well. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So how do you change that? I mean, how do you incentivize wealthier countries to take in more refugees? SALIL SHETTY : One of the early calls that Amnesty International made is that, you know, this is a global crisis of proportions we've not seen since the second world war. So it needs a global response. So finally, we had a leaders meeting of the United Nations just a couple of weeks ago. But unfortunately, it was a spectacular failure. There was not a single binding, precise target which came out of that. We need groups of countries who are more willing to come forward and start taking people in. Also, like - and we've seen this. Canada, for example, has already accepted 25,000 more Syrian refugees. Germany has accepted 1 million. So it's really boiled down to a leadership choice. SALIL SHETTY : The surveys we've done with the public, you know, it completely busts this myth that the local population in these rich countries don't want to accept refugees. Like, if you take the U.S., for example, our surveys show that over 70 percent of the U.S. population do welcome refugees. In fact, 15 percent are ready to take them into their own houses. So I think it's indicative that, you know, the public is ahead of the leaders. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Although you mentioned Germany, which, in Europe, has been the country to accept the most refugees from the Syrian conflict. The chancellor there, Angela Merkel, has suffered a real political hit because of that. SALIL SHETTY : She has, and there's no question about it. But, you know, you can't change things overnight. So we need long-term process of educating the population, getting them to hear the facts because what happens is that the third or so who are against refugees coming in are very vocal. And they're creating a whole atmosphere of fear, which is totally not based on the facts. SALIL SHETTY : I mean, one of the things I always tell people is that since I've spent time in these camps, I've not met a single woman, man or child who's told me, from Syria, that they would like to come to Europe. It's not a lifestyle choice, you know, to traverse the Mediterranean where thousands of people died through drownings. Or, you know - most of these European countries have signed on to the 1951 Refugee Convention, so they're simply in violation of that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : When you talk about solutions to this, you say you just need more wealthy countries to be willing to resettle refugees. And you do point to Canada as a country that has been successful in that. They've taken in more than 30,000 Syrians since 2015, compared to the U.S., which has taken in a little over 12,000 Syrian refugees. What is it about Canada's system that works? SALIL SHETTY : At the global level, the problem is we don't have a system. You know, right now, we have a completely ad hoc process where the neighboring countries simply end up carrying this burden for decades. So our proposal is that instead of 10 countries taking the load, can we share this across 60 to 90 countries on an objective basis - you know, depending on your size of your country, your population, your wealth? SALIL SHETTY : But in the case of Canada, it is really a political choice. We've been told that Canadians don't like refugees. They don't want refugees. So what happened suddenly - they suddenly changed their mind? That's not true. I mean, it was really Trudeau and, you know, their leadership. And they said that this is what Canadian values are about. And really, you know, the U.S. is another country where - it's a country that was created by people coming in from outside. I mean, if you look at what Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty is all about, it's about creating a - you know, a diverse, inclusive country, which has become so powerful because of its diversity. But, you know, in practice, the U.S. is hardly taking anybody. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What about aid, though? The United States, for example, has given more than $5 billion toward the Syrian refugee crisis. That's a lot of money. Is that not making a difference? SALIL SHETTY : So - I mean, absolutely it does. And don't forget, again, that, you know, a lot of these are pledges, you know, these announcements which come in meetings. You finally look at what the actual money that goes across - it's close to nothing. But the main point I'd make is, humanitarian financing, very important as it is, is not a substitute for resettling people and receiving refugees. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Salil Shetty is the secretary general of Amnesty International. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thank you so much. SALIL SHETTY : Thank you. \n\n ###",

Coudersport is a small town of about 2,500 people in the northern part of Pennsylvania. Jaimi Hajzus grew up there. And she lives a couple of hours away now, but she got all kinds of concerned messages from friends about these packages. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So she teamed up with Coudersport resident Joe Leschner who started a Facebook group to gather information and help fight the KKK's presence in that town. Jaimi Hajzus joins us now from Franklin, Pa. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Welcome to the program. JAIMI HAJZUS : Hi. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what did the fliers say specifically? JAIMI HAJZUS : It said something like, are you concerned about what's going on in town? - and something like, you can sleep tonight because the KKK is watching. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So it was some kind of recruitment tool? JAIMI HAJZUS : I think so. I don't think that they were trying to make people feel safer. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Is there a history of Klan activity in that town or in that area? JAIMI HAJZUS : Unfortunately, yes. There's a little bit of history there. When I was growing up in Coudersport in the 1990s, a man named Augusts Christ lived there and was active in the white supremacy movement. He would often harass anti-racist church leaders, neighbors and community members. We saw more activity through the 1990s, where people from out of town were coming in town to gather for these white supremacist events. August Christ then moved out of Potter County around 1999. You know, we had kind of 16 - 15, 16 years of peace and quiet in Coudersport. And then - and now this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So how did residents respond when they got these things? JAIMI HAJZUS : People are upset. This isn't the sort of thing that we, as a small town, want to be known for. It is primarily white town, and we would like to be known for hunting and fishing. And we have an ice mine and other touristy-type attractions. And I think we've worked really hard to overcome this negative press (laughter). So it's disheartening to have it come back. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You said it's a predominantly white town. Are there African-Americans or other minority families who live there? And have you reached out to them to understand how they're processing this? JAIMI HAJZUS : There are some. And actually, Joe Leschner took up the cause because he realized that members of his own family were feeling scared and threatened. Joe's wife is from Jamaica. And she felt scared, and he didn't like that at all. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The Facebook group that you guys have started is called Twin Tiers for Racial Equality. How are you using the space, and what's your goal? JAIMI HAJZUS : We want to send a message that this hateful rhetoric is not welcome in our town. But also, we're trying to start a movement about saying things out loud to other white people. So white people need to stop talking the talk and start walking the walk in terms of how we behave towards our black and brown friends and neighbors, beginning with the words that we use and how we behave in our daily lives with other white people and including how we vote. JAIMI HAJZUS : A big part of our campaign is this hashtag, #sayitoutloud, which means that we confront racism in real time right away when we see it or hear it. So one of our most important jobs as white allies is to confront our white friends and families when they are being racist. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There have been reports of similar packages, like the ones that were delivered to the residents of Coudersport, these things showing up at people's houses across the country. Are you hearing from a lot of people outside Pennsylvania who found your Facebook group? JAIMI HAJZUS : Yes, actually. We started hearing from people in Kansas and in other places, mostly sort of intensely rural small towns where there might be literally one or two people. But they've decided to take up this cause and try and threaten and harass their friends and neighbors. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Jaimi, have you gotten any threats as a result of this work? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Colin Powell, Simone Biles, Serena and Venus Williams - this past week, they joined a growing list of Americans, including Democratic Party officials, who have had their emails and private records hacked, reportedly by Russian-linked cyber spies. The hacks and leaks and Donald Trump's call for more have already shaken up the U.S. presidential campaign. Now the question is what further threat could they present to the integrity of our electoral process. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : James Andrew Lewis has been thinking a lot about this. He's a cyber security expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies here in Washington, and he joins me in our studio. Thanks so much for coming in. ANDREW LEWIS : Thanks for having me on the show. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : First off, the Obama administration hasn't even said for sure that Russia is actually behind these hacks. Are you so sure? ANDREW LEWIS : The Obama administration hasn't said publicly. In private, it's an open secret in Washington. I don't know why they just don't say it. I mean, maybe they're trying to manage the politics of relations with Putin, but there's no doubt that it's Russian intelligence services. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Why are you so convinced? ANDREW LEWIS : Well, there's two sets of evidence. The first set of evidence is the firms that have investigated the hacks that use forensic techniques. They found things that point back to Moscow and state agencies. And then second, we of course have our own intelligence methods that have also been persuasive. So between the two, everybody's saying it's the Russians. There shouldn't be any doubt. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And what's the motivation? ANDREW LEWIS : There's two sets of motivation. One is petty and childish. I mean, they're still sort of grumpy about losing the Cold War. They were annoyed at having their athletes kicked out of the Olympics. That's the only motive for this stupid World Doping Agency hack. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This was the Olympic athletes. ANDREW LEWIS : Yeah. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Simone Biles, in particular. ANDREW LEWIS : That was simply payback. But there's a larger campaign that Russia is using to delegitimize Western democracy, to split the U.S. and Europe and to promote far right parties, not only in the U.S., but in France, in Germany, in Scandinavia. So this is a bigger campaign to manipulate Western politics. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In which direction, though, because Colin Powell - in the emails that were made public, he was perhaps more critical of Trump, but he also had tough words to say about Hillary Clinton. ANDREW LEWIS : The goal here isn't to pick one side or the other to win, although I think they have a clear favorite. The goal is to create disruption, confusion, to delegitimize the results of our election. And President Putin has already been saying that. He said, how can they criticize us? Because - look at their own elections. Would anyone call them democratic? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona this summer. So, again, no conclusive evidence that this was Russia or Russian-linked cyber spies, but it does prove that these systems are vulnerable. Do you think the U.S. government is preparing for future attacks that could genuinely undermine the election come November 8? ANDREW LEWIS : Well, it's already kind of succeeded. There's doubt about the elections, and so they could - people back in Moscow could say, we've already had some success. One of the problems for us - and in some ways, it's a good problem - is it's a federal system. So there's 51 different entities that control the state elections, and then there's thousands of counties, each with different machines, different processes. So it's not like you can find the place where the elections are controlled. ANDREW LEWIS : That makes it harder for the Russians to manipulate them. But it also makes it harder for us to come up with a defense because the U.S. government does not own the elections. The states do. And there's an effort by DHS to work with the states to harden their electoral systems, but Uncle Sam has limited time, limited tools. The election's coming up close, and we might just have to grin and bear it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Overall, what's the impact on U.S.-Russian relations of this particular chapter? ANDREW LEWIS : It looks to me like about a month ago, they were getting ready to sanction Russia. The president created new cybersecurity sanctions. And it looked like they were getting ready to do it, and then something got in the way. Maybe it was a desire to see if they could get a truce in Syria. For whatever reason, they didn't pull the trigger. \n\n ###",

He said Hillary Clinton is responsible for first raising questions about whether or not President Obama was born in the United States. DONALD TRUMP : Hillary Clinton... DONALD TRUMP : ...And her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That statement is not true. In fact, it was Trump who led the charge to try and delegitimize Obama's presidency by floating the idea that the president was actually from Kenya. Trump has spent a lot of time lately accusing Hillary Clinton of things that Democrats have actually been saying about him. NPR's Scott Detrow explains. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : Here's something that Donald Trump said about Hillary Clinton the other week. DONALD TRUMP : She's trigger happy and very unstable. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : Sounds a little familiar, doesn't it? That's because the suggestion that Trump is too unstable, too unpredictable to be commander-in-chief has been a central attack Clinton has been making against her opponent all year. HILLARY CLINTON : A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : This has been happening a lot lately. Trump takes the main critiques Clinton makes against him and says no, they apply to her, too. It's kind of like his campaign strategy comes from that childhood comeback to an insult. I'm rubber, and you're glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you. This trend really got a lot of attention when Trump started saying this. DONALD TRUMP : Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions and only hatred and derision. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : Now, the fact is that Clinton's campaign has buried itself in white papers and policies. And until lately, Trump has instead stuck to broad pronouncements, many of which boil down to the fact that he'll fix things because of his track record as a businessman. Clinton has repeatedly criticized him for not offering any details, but now Trump is throwing that charge back in her face. JOHN BRABENDER : What they're trying to do is make sure that everybody looks and says OK, she's as bad as he is. And I think they've looked at it as a net win. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : John Brabender is Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist who's worked in presidential politics. Taking your opponent's most positive trait and using it against him or her is a typical political tactic. But embracing your weaknesses and trying to use them on your opponent like a Judo throw - that's a little different. JOHN BRABENDER : What most candidates want to do is they want to immediately diffuse the attack against them by just responding to the attack. And I think it's actually a pretty innovative and somewhat ingenious solution to say - yeah? Well, let's talk about her - how on the same thing she's even worse. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : Brabender says Trump and his staff realize that every campaign event is going to be boiled down to just a few quotes or moments. Last month offers a good example. Hillary Clinton delivered a detailed, researched speech on Trump's many disparaging remarks about minority groups and the way the fringe alt-right nationalist movement has embraced Trump's campaign. HILLARY CLINTON : This is someone who retweets white supremacists online. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : Around the same time, Trump responded with a few lines at a rally. DONALD TRUMP : Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color... DONALD TRUMP : ...Only as votes. SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE : And as John Brabender says Trump anticipated, many stories quoted them at almost equal levels. \n\n ###",

His company occupied the 101st to 105th floors of One World Trade Center. On September 11, 2001, he lost his brother and 658 of his colleagues. Lutnick survived and vowed to keep the firm alive. Now, 15 years later, he is still the CEO. And he joins us on the line from New York. Thank you so much for taking the time. HOWARD LUTNICK : Hey. It's my pleasure, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I'm sure there are a lot of moments and conversations that stand out from that first 24-hour period. But could I ask you to share one or two that stick with you? HOWARD LUTNICK : Sure. So the night of September 11, I didn't really know who was alive and who wasn't alive. So we had a conference call. It was about 10 o'clock at night. And my employees called in. And I said, look, we have two choices. HOWARD LUTNICK : We can shut the firm down and go to our friends' funerals. Remember, that would be 20 funerals a day every day for 35 straight days. And I've got to tell you, If'm not really interested in going to work. All I want to do is climb under the covers and hug my family. HOWARD LUTNICK : But if we are going to go to work, we're going to do it to take care of our friends' families. So what do you want to do? You guys want to shut it down? Or do you want to work harder than you've ever worked before in your life? And that was the moment where the company survived. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You weren't there on that morning. HOWARD LUTNICK : So it was my son Kyle's first day of kindergarten. And then as I walk him upstairs, an administrator grabs me and says, you know, your office is looking for you. A plane has hit the building. So I jumped in the car. And obviously, as I got down there, I saw that huge, black, billowing smoke. HOWARD LUTNICK : And the guy that was driving my car started crying. I was like, let's just - we got to get there. We just got to get there. And so I drove right to the building and got to the door of the building and started grabbing people as they came out. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Did you see anyone you knew? HOWARD LUTNICK : I didn't. You know, I was grabbing people as they came out. And then I heard this sound. It was the loudest sound I'd ever heard. What it was was Two World Trade Center collapsed. So I just start running. I'm just running. HOWARD LUTNICK : And I look over my shoulder. And there's this big, giant, black tornado of smoke chasing me. So I dive under a car. And the black smoke just went foosh (ph). You know, I was saying, don't breathe, don't breathe, don't breathe. And then take a deep breath. HOWARD LUTNICK : And then, you know, all this sort of particles and soot and dust starts filling my lungs. I understood right away that if I was suffocating and I was outside, how could they possibly have survived inside? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Was your brother in the building? HOWARD LUTNICK : My brother Gary was 36, and he was in the building. And later that night when I spoke to my sister, she told me that she spoke to my brother. And she had said to him, oh, my God. Thank God you're not there. You know, thank God you're not there. HOWARD LUTNICK : And he said, I am here. And I'm going to die. And I just wanted to tell you I love you. And he said goodbye. He said - you know, my sister got to talk to my brother when he said goodbye. I still get choked up. Sorry. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's OK. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you had a business to run amidst overwhelming grief. How did you begin to put those pieces together? HOWARD LUTNICK : Well, decisions I made were they needed to have a boss for the business. If I didn't have a leader, I shut it. And I had a division of 86 people where four people survived. And you can't really build a business back with four people. HOWARD LUTNICK : Basically, we went from being a great company that was making a million dollars a day to a company that was losing a million dollars a day. But they all have mortgages to pay, and they need to put food on their table. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, three weeks ago, federal sentences for crack cocaine were much tougher. Then, new guidelines from the U.S. Sentencing Commission took effect, bringing the penalties more in line with what some advocates say is fair. But what about people already serving their sentences? Are those too lengthy? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, the commission is now considering whether to reduce prison terms for thousands of people in jail for crack cocaine offenses. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Later on the show, we'll speak with someone who opposes retroactive resentencing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : But first, Mark Mauer. He's executive director of the Sentencing Project and he thinks that convicts already serving sentences should get theirs reduced, which means some would be let out of jail. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Hi. Thanks. Good to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, explain this. A person arrested for crack cocaine offense on October 31st, a federal offense, would get a different sentence from someone who got theirs on November 1st? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Exactly. You know, the crack cocaine laws go back to the mid-1980s and punish crack cocaine offenses far more harshly than powder cocaine. And the U.S. Sentencing Commission, recognizing this disparity, has modified the sentences somewhat, but for people sentenced as November 1st. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : So, essentially, someone who is sentenced on October 31st might have gotten a 10-year sentence for crack offense. A similar person sentenced on November 1st is now getting roughly a nine-year sentence. And the question is, is there any justification for making those different or should we make it retroactive to people who've already been sentenced and are sitting in prison right now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : As part of this whole debate over crack and powder cocaine, these reduced sentences or the reduced guidelines would still have much higher penalties for crack cocaine, correct? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Far higher. One quick example. There's a guy in prison right now by the name of Willie Mays Aikens. He's a former baseball star for the Kansas City Royals, played in the World Series, subsequently became addicted to drugs and started selling drugs and sold to an undercover agent. He was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and is in the middle of doing about a 20-year sentence. If this proposal goes through, to make it retroactive, he'll have about three years, cut-off in his sentence. He'll still do 17 o 18 years. If he'd been convicted of selling powder cocaine, he would have gotten a sentence about two and a half years only. That's the magnitude of the difference we're looking at. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So the Sentencing Commission is taking this up now. When could we expect a decision? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Well, some people have heard that they may make a decision in January. They can do it at anytime, so it's likely within the next month or two. They had a full day of hearings this week, heard very broad variety of views. So I think all the information that they need to look at this issue is certainly before them right now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How does race play into this convictions over crack and powder cocaine? Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Well, race is fundamental to the whole policy. You know, back in 1986 when these laws were adopted by Congress, we have this relatively new drug that had come on the scene, crack cocaine. And the image of that - the crack user, whether or not it was entirely correct - was that of a young black male, sometimes young black female. I mean, we have cover of Newsweek magazine and similar - lots of stories on television. That was the image that came across. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : And the Congress passed the crack cocaine mandatory sentencing laws, really, in record time. There are virtually no hearings held, no discussion about - with experts in the field who knew something about addiction or treatment. And it's hard to escape the fact or the conclusion that the rush to judgment had something to do with the perception of the person who is being affected. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : It's intriguing to note that the Sentencing Commission has previously made retroactive changes for other drug sentencing laws, particularly for marijuana and LSD, where they change the law that made it retroactive. Mr. MARK MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project) : Those changes primarily benefited white defendants. Here, the estimates are 85 percent of the people who would benefit from crack retroactivity would be African-Americans. So it's a very stark contrast before us. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Do you, in your mind - although, you're advocating this - see any downside to potentially releasing people who have already been convicted under existing laws? \n\n ###",

Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in modern history. So in many ways, this year's election has become a question of character. The candidates themselves understand that. HILLARY CLINTON : I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. DONALD TRUMP : Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. I think I am a nice person. People that know me like me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We're going to explore some of the character traits that push voters away in this election. For Clinton, it's the way she seems to protect her privacy at all costs. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: The server contains personal communications from my husband and me. And I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : For Trump, it's how he seems to crave public attention and says anything to get it. DONALD TRUMP : They say I have the most loyal people. Did you ever see that - where I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK? It's, like, incredible. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We'll focus on Donald Trump elsewhere in the show but first, Hillary Clinton and the trust gap with the American people that even she admits she has to bridge. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: You can't just talk someone into trusting you. You've got to earn it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Here she is on the campaign trail this summer in Chicago. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: So yes, I could say that the reason I sometimes sound careful with my words is not that I'm hiding something. It's just that I'm careful with my words. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: I believe what you say actually matters. I think that's true in life, and it's especially true if you're president. So I do think before I speak. And I could say that political opponents and conspiracy theorists have accused me of every crime in the book over the years. None of it's true - never has been. But accusations like that never really disappear once they're out there. HILLARY CLINTON : Growing up and really kind of watching my mom in the arena, I don't remember a time when she wasn't attacked. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Chelsea Clinton has spent a lifetime trying to understand why. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : C. CLINTON: My earliest political memories really come from 1986 when my dad was running for re-election as governor of Arkansas. And he was running against a man named Frank White who had been governor of Arkansas before. And he spent much of the campaign, although he was running against my dad, attacking my mom. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And I remember this so vividly, I think, because one of his lines of attack was against her as a mother. You know, she must be a terrible mother because we see her working as a lawyer. She must spend all her time kind of in her office or in the courtroom. And it just all seemed kind of crazy to me because I was an only child. And so I thought kind of my opinion about my mom should matter a lot more than Frank White's opinion about my mom. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And so my entire life, there's been this cognitive dissonance between the public characterization of my mother and my lived experience with her as my mom. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The public characterization of Hillary Clinton that began back in Arkansas had a lot to do with what she wasn't. She wasn't a Southerner. She was from Illinois. She wasn't a stay at home mom. She was a partner at a law firm. She wasn't Hillary Clinton. She was Hillary Rodham. Here's an interview she did with Arkansas public television in 1979. UNIDENTIFIED HOST : Does it bother you that because you don't use your husband's name that people think you're too liberal? And, after all, this is not a state known for liberalism. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : A 30-something-year-old Hillary Rodham essentially says too bad. \n\n ###",

CLINTON: Some people may think I'm, you know, too this or too that. But I think that's another one of the dangers about being in public life. One cannot live one's life based on what somebody else's image of you might be. All one can do is live the life that God gave you. And, you know, you just do the best you can. And if somebody likes you or doesn't like you, that's really, in many ways, something you have no control over. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That was Hillary Rodham in 1979 in Arkansas. Fast forward more than a decade. Her husband is running for president, and she is still uncomfortable with the public expectations of being a political wife. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas. But what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Being a politician's wife was difficult for her in general. But being Bill Clinton's wife came with added complications. STEVE KROFT : I'm Steve Kroft. And this is a special abbreviated edition of \"60 Minutes.\" Tonight, Democratic presidential hopeful Governor Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, talk about their life, their marriage and the allegations that have all but stalled his presidential campaign. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Allegations of infidelity, which forced Hillary Clinton to both defend her husband and her marriage. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : H. CLINTON: You know, I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette. DAVID MARANISS : By the time they started to run for the presidency, Hillary Clinton had made her bargain. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is journalist David Maraniss. He's covered the Clintons for decades. DAVID MARANISS : She knew Bill Clinton's history, and she decided that what they could do together in terms of policy was far more important than his personal flaws. And because they were so closely tied together in their rise, she had to defend him. DAVID MARANISS : H. CLINTON: The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That was Hillary Clinton on NBC's \"Today Show\" in January of 1998, defending her husband after the allegations about Monica Lewinsky surfaced. But with that now-famous right-wing conspiracy remark, she was firing back at years of scandals that have loomed over the Clintons and complicated their political fortunes. DAVID MARANISS : You know, with the Clintons, a lot of things are true and false at the same time. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Again, journalist David Maraniss. DAVID MARANISS : It's part of the complexity of their place in American politics. And so whether it was an actual conspiracy or not, it is irrefutable that the right wing was more agitated by the Clintons and more prone to go after them in any way, whether something was accurate or not than any other Democratic politicians. And so by the time, you know, the Monica Lewinsky story broke and Hillary sort of rallied the troops and came to his defense and went on \"The Today Show\" and issued that statement and was really the strongest person in the White House during that crucial period when some - you know, many people were saying that Clinton would have to resign. It was Hillary that was actually the steel there. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Some Americans didn't trust Hillary Clinton to tell the truth because her husband didn't when it came to Monica Lewinsky. They also didn't trust her because she was fundamentally changing what it meant to be a first lady. Yes, she oversaw the Christmas decorations at the White House and hosted state dinners. But she also had a lot of power from the beginning, when her husband put her in charge of health care reform. Hillary Clinton was an important policy adviser. MELANNE VERVEER : I think it can best be summed up by the phrase - who elected her? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is Melanne Verveer. She was Hillary Clinton's chief of staff when she was first lady and when she oversaw the administration's push for health care reform in 1993. Verveer says there was a lot of pushback to that appointment, even inside the White House. MELANNE VERVEER : Who elected her to come in and have this kind of power over a significant part of the U.S. economy, at least in terms of what health care represented? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It's been a never-ending cycle with Hillary Clinton over the years. She gets criticized because of her personality or professional ambition, then she gets defensive. Then she gets criticized for being defensive, and she pulls the drawbridge up even further. David Maraniss sees direct evidence of that with the scandal that's plagued her current presidential campaign, her decision to use a private email address and private server while secretary of state. \n\n ###",

Turkey distributors say the number of frozen birds is the lowest it's been in five years, and that shortage might cost you. Mix that in with rising energy cost and you've got a perfect recipe for the biggest annual increase in holiday food prices since 1990. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we've got author and economist Julianne Malveaux. She's also the president of Bennett College. Welcome. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Hi, Farai, how are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Getting ready to help out my mom in the kitchen. Now, a turkey dinner's going to cost 11 percent more this holiday season compared to last year, that's according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. So, explain what we're paying for when we consider putting the bird and the fixings in the shopping cart. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Well you called it right when you introed the piece. It's partly energy cost. It's harder to transport things who are more expensive, anyway. It's partly the shortage of birds, which we might have predicted. People who are trying to contain cost really might want look at something other than a turkey, and there are other things our folk can buy. But if you want the traditional meal, 11 percent is higher than the increase in the consumer price index. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : But, Farai, the other thing that we should bear in mind is this particular Farm Bureau survey is a very weak survey - its 150 people at about 30 cities. And so there are other ways to look at this stuff, and the cost a conscious consumer can probably break even from last year. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I have to say that they say the average Thanksgiving meal will cost about $42 for a family of 10. That doesn't sound too bad to me. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : No, it really doesn't. And so while I think it's useful to track prices around this, I don't think that these are alarming data. And again, as I said, where are people actually shopping? What are they doing? If they're going to the Costcos and the other discount stores of the world, are they having the same challenges? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : So, I'm not sure that we want to get alarmed about this, but certainly, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, what we might want to do is think about the people who don't have the dollars, the access, the money or the food, and the people will be celebrating this thankful day alone or in dire circumstances. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, this is the season of spending. We have talked about this before and we're going to talk about it again. How, in general, should people think about holiday spending, whether it's on food or other items as something that fits into the flow of life? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : People should budget it. We know - we've all known that the holidays were coming since the beginning of the year, so hopefully people have budgeted. If you're having the big Thanksgiving dinner or something else, that's a part of your budget. And if you're doing something for a huge family, as many of us do, you're asking people maybe pitch in. Everyone just doesn't come and eat, but they come and share. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : But all - every spending incidents is something that should show up in someone's budget. We know that the average family spends, you know, between 100 and $1,000, over the holiday season, starting Thanksgiving going through Christmas for gifts and for other kinds of special occurrences, and those things should be budgeted. So people should really not get into the impulse thing of, hey, I've got my credit card and I love Uncle Joe and there's this great blue cashmere sweater I'm going to buy it for. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : It should be, okay, I've got 800 bucks in my budget because that's what I have. And, you know, this sweater has to be taken into the context of everything else that I might want to buy. That's hard for people. I mean, a lot of - unfortunately, Farai, we equate consumerism with caring, and that's something that we just have to unpack and stop doing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, let's talk a little bit more about these energy prices. You said it could affect the food prices. Now, there has been a conversation between American people and the media and head of Shell Oil. Shell Oil President John Hofmeister has been receiving a lot of angry letters, including one possible death threat from customers who want to know what's going on with these fuel prices. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So he appeared on CNN's \"American Morning\" last Thursday to answer gas price concerns. He recently wrapped up a 50-city tour to talk with folks about rising cost. Mr. JOHN HOFMEISTER (President, Shell Oil) : Well, it was more listen. Listen to Americans about their issues, their concerns to see what could we possibly do about it. And I tell you, I come away with a very strong conclusion and that conclusion is it's time for Americans to agitate their government to open up more oil and gas resources in this country. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So he says he's listening, but he also says that he wants people to agitate, to open up American oil resources. We, of course, import oil from many different nations. There was so much of a battle over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off of - over offshore drilling opportunities near Louisiana. Is this really what Americans want? Where is this conversation coming from? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Well, this is a matter of supply and demand, Farai. And the fact is that we are not supplying enough of our own energy. There are possibilities in our nation, but those possibilities have implications that are environmental and have other reverberations. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Mr. Hofmeister is - excuse me - is basically raising a question that keeps being raised of how far we're willing to go and how many dollars we're willing to spend to basically find a domestic resource. But they're wrong. He's raising, really, in my mind, the wrong question because the other question is, what have we been doing about our energy policy? What are we doing about conservation? And I understand why people are angry, when you see the way that oil prices have risen and you see these profits. It's not just the prices. It's the profits. People are upset about it that they're saying, what's in it for me? What are you getting and what am I getting? \n\n ###",

And these are issues that have unresolved, as you know, Farai, since the mid-'70s, when we had those first sets of lines and first sort of energy crisis that we've gone back to that again and again and again. But our nation has been unwilling because of the profiteering of folks like Shell to deal with issues of conservation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Mr. Hofmeister says that increasing the oil supply in the short term could help the research for renewable energy in the long term. What do you make of that? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Well, I think that's a pretty self-serving kind of comment, frankly. I do think that, obviously, the profits can be used for research, but then the responsible question might be, what have you been doing with the profits heretofore? The oil companies have never had profit-free quarters. You've not seen their prices - their stock prices drops significantly. So I - if that question were raised to me or posed to me, then I want to say, what is your record on research right now? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It seems, in a way, as if there is a Scylla and Charybdis effect. If you create oil here in the U.S., there are environmental risks. If you import oil, if you have oil shipped around, you can have, as we've seen recently, disasters where the beaches are flooded with oil. Is there any way to avoid some of these risks? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : No, there really isn't. This is all about looking at cause and benefits. And certainly, the environmental risks that we may face are real. The other risks that we face in terms of importing are real. And then there's the issue of the geopolitical situation around imports and what that means around availability. We know that, for example, some of the oil-producing countries are not in love with the United States and indeed may be moving some of their reserves to the euro as opposed to the dollar. These are things that we need to be concerned about when we talk about what's going on. But\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Julianne\u2026 Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : Yes? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I have to jump in here. You said euro\u2026 Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : I did. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \u2026and it's a perfect time to actually talk about the euro. So prices for oil might keep on rising if members of the oil cartel, OPEC, convert their cash reserves from dollars to euros. They were talking very seriously about this. And there's even signs closer to home that the euro, which 26 European countries use rules right now over the dollar. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Take Jay Z's recent music video for the \"American Gangster\"-inspired song, \"Blue Magic.\" JAY Z (Rapper) : (Singing) So easily do a W-H-I-P. My repetition with riches will bring you kilo business. I got Creole C-O\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, what you can't tell is that he is flossing a wad of 500 euro bills. So this whole idea of dollar, dollar, bill you all and the Benjamins seems to be so 2002. What does that mean that, you know, the Wu Tang Web site also has the price in Euros? You know, there is - what does that mean that American pop culture is embracing the euro? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : It means that rappers are smarter than I thought they were. Actually, if you look at the inception of the euro, it was trading on par with the dollar. Now, it's about 1.4748 euro to the dollar, which means the dollar has basically declined in value to the Euro over the years. A folk like Jay-Z and others are paying attention to that. But they're not the only ones paying attention. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : China has talked about changing its currency portfolio to carry more Euros than dollars. The oil-producing companies have talked about that as well, Farai. And indeed, when you look at any number of things, it suggests that the United States is at the brink of losing its eminence because of any, again, I want to use the word geopolitical forces, but additionally, our economy, while it looks good internally, quite frankly, is not doing as well as it might. And the bottom line is we're not investing in our futures. The Euro is a better bet for a lot of people than dollars. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, when we say better bet, do you mean that it's a better longtime investment, long-term investment to hold on to Euros, is that what you're talking about? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : I think a lot of people - no. Currency dominance - and the British pound was once a dominant currency. Currency dominance speaks to national eminence. I mean, currencies will fluctuate. The euro has and will continue to do so, as does the dollar or any other, the pound, the peso, you name it. Currencies will fluctuate. Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : What people really doing are voting with their feet about their opinion of the United States. In other words, you don't think much of the United States, you're not going to hold dollars. You think better of the euro, you're going to hold euros. You think better of, you know, you pick the country, you're going to hold their currency. So we've seen essentially people make decisions about what they think of our country and flip it into the currency. If they had done this a decade ago or decade and a half ago, they would not have had such an alternative. But the euro has become a credible alternative to the dollar. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Will it effect at all prices on what we pay here in the States? Dr. JULIANNE MALVEAUX (Author and Economist; President, Bennett College) : It won't necessarily affect prices on domestic goods. It may well affect prices on imported goods. At the same time, you know, our economic weakness makes us stronger in the import market. So - the fact that Jay-Z or whomever is choosing dollars over - or euros over the dollar does not hit you in your pocketbook today, but the moment that the dollar becomes the least preferred currency, that will hit us because there will be more vulnerable to other people's fluctuations. \n\n ###",

Today, we've got Eddie Escobedo. He's founder and publisher of El Mundo newspaper in Las Vegas. Also Sean Gonsalves, a reporter for The Cape Cod Times. And Bob Butler, a reporter for KCBS Radio in San Francisco. Welcome, folks. Mr. EDDIE ESCOBEDO (Founder and Publisher, El Mundo Newspaper) : All right. Thank you for having me. Mr. SEAN GONSALVES (Reporter, Cape Cod Times) : Thank you. Mr. BOB BUTLER (Reporter, KCBS Radio, San Francisco) : How are you? Mr. SEAN GONSALVES (Reporter, Cape Cod Times) : Very good, very good. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm great. So let's pick up with what happened last night and just put it in context. Eddie, Nevada is being called the Latino primary state because almost one in four Nevadans are of Latino descent. Do you think that that's a fair assessment? Mr. EDDIE ESCOBEDO (Founder and Publisher, El Mundo Newspaper) : Well, we were (audio gap) Nevadans were not satisfied with what happened last night because we wanted to talk about the local issues of state and, of course, city issues than - or what's affecting Nevada. And within - the only thing they discussed was the Yucca Mountain and, of course, the - illegal immigration. But there's some more issue that we are concerned with and we were not able to. And, of course, for some reason, I was not very satisfied with the way it was conducted because there was no exchange between the candidates and the moderator, and a lot of times, we didn't get the right answer, because they went around, not giving the specific answer, yes or no. Mr. EDDIE ESCOBEDO (Founder and Publisher, El Mundo Newspaper) : And so, even though we were very proud and very happy it happened here in Nevada and it was televised national - I mean, worldwide. So, definitely, that's a plus plus for Las Vegas. But here, again, we - Nevada residents were not happy because of the issues that were discussed here last night. Same issues. They have the war, the health care. But the issues that affect Nevada were not discussed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, let met get Bob in here. Don't you think could be just fallout from the television era that people are not playing to the local audience, they're playing to the camera. Mr. BOB BUTLER (Reporter, KCBS Radio, San Francisco) : You know, I think that's true for all candidates. Nowadays, they know that every time that they say a word, it could be seen by the entire country. So, you might have people who are in Nevada but they're really thinking about that, you know, that state still up for grabs, some place in the Midwest or some place back east. So their messages are all - you know, I don't even think these people write their own messages anymore. I think the messages are written by strategists and spin doctors. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Sean, when you listened last night, did\u2026 Mr. SEAN GONSALVES (Reporter, Cape Cod Times) : Oh, forgive me, (unintelligible)? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Sean, when you listened last night, did you hear anything that stood out to you? Mr. SEAN GONSALVES (Reporter, Cape Cod Times) : You know, I got to say that I'm skeptical that these debates really change people's minds in any substantial way. I'm always kind of disappointed with the debates because I kind of like old school debates like, you know, Lincoln-Douglas types, you know, slug-them-out, you know, let's get down and nitty-gritty. And I don't know that Americans necessarily have the attention span for that. Certainly the formats aren't that way. Mr. SEAN GONSALVES (Reporter, Cape Cod Times) : I guess the thing that stood out to me was, you know, the setup to this whole thing was, you know, will Hillary be able to sort of recover after she seem like she did not so good on the 30th of October. But I thought she handled herself pretty well, although I think there were a couple of key questions that she very definitely maneuvered out of without answering too well. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, you know what, we are going to take a quick and be back with more of our Reporters' Roundtable. We are speaking with Sean Gonsalves, a reporter for the Cape Cod Times, Eddie Escobedo, founder and publisher of El Mundo Newspaper in Las Vegas, and Bob Butler, a reporter for KCBS Radio in San Francisco. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just ahead, we continue to slice and dice the headlines on our Reporters' Roundtable. And in our family series, making the hard decision to sever family ties. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : This is NPR News. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : This is NEWS & NOTES. I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome back to the Reporters' Roundtable. Today, I'm talking to Eddie Escobedo, he's the founder and publisher of El Mundo Newspaper in Las Vegas, Nevada. Sean Gonsalves is a reporter for the Cape Cod Times. And Bob Butler is a reporter for KCBS radio in San Francisco. Let's just pick up where we left off. I want to transition to a topic that is related to some of the national issues that got discussed in this debate. You have New York governor Eliot Spitzer reversing his controversial plan to provide undocumented workers with driver's licenses. He said it would improve public safety. He got an endorsement from New York senator Hillary Clinton. Since then, both elected officials have backed off and said that they do not support licenses for undocumented workers. \n\n ###",

NBC host Matt Lauer was thrown into the lion's den this past week when he was tasked with hosting the Commander-In-Chief Forum, two back-to-back interviews with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Critics piled on, saying Lauer didn't challenge Trump's claim that he's always been against the war in Iraq. We thought we'd call up someone who has been in that kind of hot seat. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Jim Lehrer hosted \"The MacNeil/Lehrer Report,\" \"The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer\" and the \"PBS Newshour\" over many years and has moderated 12 presidential debates. He joins me now. Welcome to the program. JIM LEHRER : Hey. Thank you, Rachel. It's a pleasure to be here. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I am interested in your take on all the criticism that was levied at NBC's Matt Lauer after that town hall event. Did you think it was warranted? JIM LEHRER : I think that what was missed in the criticism was that he was not moderating. He was interviewing. Those were two back-to-back, one-on-one interviews. JIM LEHRER : And they're two very different workloads. And if they had been - for instance, if Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had been together and Lauer was running a discussion between them, there wouldn't have been an issue about, for instance, when Donald Trump supported or didn't support the war in Iraq, etc., etc., etc. She would've taken him on right there. JIM LEHRER : But if you're running a one-on-one interview, the interviewer is the one who has to say, no, no, no, wait a minute. What about this? What about this? What about that? What you don't want to do as a moderator is think you're doing interviews. You're not. That's a different game. JIM LEHRER : You want to hear the candidates do the fact-checking, do the challenging, do the - hey, no, no, no, no, that's the wrong way to go at defeating ISIS. Here's my plan. Your plan stinks. Mine's better. You know, rather than the interviewer - to say, well, this is a different blah, blah, blah, let the candidates do it. Forget the questions. This isn't about questions. It's about subject. It's about listening to the candidates talk and deciding when to react and how to react and when to move on and when not to move on. JIM LEHRER : It isn't about sitting down hours and hours and writing these really, really nifty questions that are going to turn somebody up and down - it's not about that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Have you been seeing that in this election cycle and perhaps the last couple? Is there a different style moderators have taken where there is more of an interview approach, where they're grilling candidates in a different way? JIM LEHRER : Well, there's always been a little bit of that. But now, see, the emphasis is all the other way. And people have not picked up on this. The 2012 presidential debates and the 2008 - it really began in 2008 - where there are 15-minute segments. JIM LEHRER : And you ask a first question. And then it's open time between the candidates. And the moderator has to move it back and forth and whatever. And people - they can talk directly to each other, ask each other questions. I mean, the candidates can. And... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you think that's a good idea or no? JIM LEHRER : Oh, I think it's terrific. I mean, I think a debate should be a debate between the candidates. And the other thing about moderating - right? - it's very different in that no matter what happens, a moderator is going to be criticized. If you don't want to be criticized, don't be a moderator of a presidential debate... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : (Laughter). JIM LEHRER : ...'Cause there's no way to win it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : How did you measure success for yourself after you would come off one of these things? JIM LEHRER : Well, the best example was the last one I did, which was in 2012. It was the first debate between Obama and Romney. And it was wide open. And I let it run. And I was criticized by some people after for doing it. But that was exactly what the debate commission wanted me to do and what I wanted to do. JIM LEHRER : The chaos is when the real world starts. And that's what I think these debates should be - is real discussions, real exchanges between the candidates about things that matter. And as long as that's happening, to me, that's a successful debate. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Earlier this month, new federal sentencing guidelines took effect for crack cocaine offenses. We just heard from an advocate who thinks people already in jail should have their sentences reduced in line with the new laws. But not everyone supports that plan. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Chuck Canterbury is national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, it's the largest law enforcement labor organization in the United States. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Chuck, welcome to the show. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Thank you. I'm glad to be here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So both you and Marc Mauer of the Sentencing Project, who we just heard from, testified on Capitol Hill earlier this week. And in your testimony, you warned of, quote \"catastrophic public safety consequences if prisoners are released early.\" Why do you think that's the case? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Well, I think, primarily, because 80 percent of the people that would be released are previously being convicted of crimes prior to this last arrest. Most of them have multiple prior convictions, and 35 percent of those that are in jail for crack possession possesses firearms during the commission of their crime. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : And if we could have - under the commission's own data, we could have a projected 2,500 this year alone, back out on the street, and 5,000 within 24 months. And with that, and with the recidivism rate for crack, we believe that there will be a rather large upswing in crack-related crimes. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, I want to get into two different areas. One is prison overcrowding, the other one is race and sentencing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Some people have looked at this whole move by the Sentencing Commission and said, well, maybe it's partly about prison overcrowding. There are prisons, for example, in California where people are sleeping in gyms and, you know, quadrupling up in places that were supposed to be for two people. Does this have anything to do with the overcrowding issue, in your opinion? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : I believe it does. I believe that there is a underlying issue of finances because I heard of a witness testify that this would save $87 million annually to the federal prison system. And that's fairly significant dollar amounts for the every day person. But in the overall picture of the federal prison, $87 million versus the damage that criminals put on the victims in America, $87 million is not an equal wash. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What about the issue of race and sentencing? Powder cocaine much lower sentences, per gram. Is there any racial disparity in your mind or are there reasons why the crack cocaine sentences are higher? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Well, there are reasons and - but we readily admit that there is a disparity. But when we testified earlier before the commission made the changes, we asked for an increase in the powder cocaine rather than reduce powder cocaine or crack cocaine. We thought they should be equal punishments, but then we thought that the punishment for the powder should move up rather than the other way around. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Congress, originally, passed crack laws because of the huge upswing in crime when crack first hit the market. They talk about the chemical compound being very similar. Well, as a practitioner, I can tell you they may test out as the same drug in a lab. But on the street, they're two different products. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : When you look at the years that crack cocaine has been on the American drug market, do you see any successes? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Yeah, but I believe the use of crack is actually down. But unfortunately, the use of crystal meth is up, and it's primarily based on socio-economic indicators rather than race, and its supply and demand. They've - they create cheaper drugs for people that can't afford them. And unfortunately, when they've done that, they've created two extremely dangerous drugs with crack and crystal meth. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, if the commission decides to retroactively sentence crack cocaine offenders and does release many of them, thousands of them, what do you think it's going to mean for police officers? Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : I think it's going to be a huge upswing in crime, predominantly, thefts and assaults. And with the increased use of firearms in drug-related cases, I believe that the current upswing in officers being killed in line of duty will go up even higher. Mr. CHUCK CANTERBURY (National President, Fraternal Order of Police) : Now, we have a 40 percent increase this year. Over last year, an officer is killed in the line of duty, and a huge increase in assaults on police officers. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Do you get any feedback from neighborhoods in terms of, you know, community policing? Do you have any idea what community members think about the issue of releasing prisoners and/or bringing the sentences more in line with powder cocaine? \n\n ###",

Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : (Singing) My name is Mable and don't you think I ain't able. TONY COX, host : The 77-year-old Louisiana native has been a top R&B singer, a successful novelist, a pastor, an activist and a movie actor, and I found out that Mable John is full of stories like the one about the time she met record mogul Berry Gordy before Motown was even Motown. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : (Singing) That you're leaving. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : How I met Berry? That was at a barber shop on (unintelligible) that was near the fine show bar, and at that time men were wearing process. Process is the (unintelligible). And I was dating a guy that was one of those process operators in the Chesterfield lounge and barbershop, and Berry was coming and getting his hair done. I was coaching choirs for my church. And my boyfriend introduced me to Berry Gordy because Berry said he was a songwriter and he was going to have a lot of people recording his songs. And my boyfriend said you need to stop doing all of this work for the church free, and that Berry Gordy do something with you so you can get paid. So he introduced me to Berry Gordy. TONY COX, host : Now, tell us the story. We're going to skip around a little bit. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : Okay. TONY COX, host : When you and Berry Gordy connected, as Motown was just becoming a company, a record company, you are the first female to record on a label, the Tamla label. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : Yes. TONY COX, host : Before Motown. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : The first single female artist, because Claudette Robinson was a part of what become the Miracles, and he was managing them along with me. TONY COX, host : Right. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : So I was the first single female artist to be signed to Tamla, which is a part of the Motown family. TONY COX, host : When you think about that now, how do you feel about looking at that as a historic moment? Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : No one could have bought that time. God had to give it to me. \n\n ###",

Hey. TONY COX, host : I understand that you were rehearsing one day and these three young girls came in and interrupted your rehearsal. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : The girls that we know now as The Supremes. They came into a rehearsal that I was doing with Berry Gordy because he played also for me, played piano for me. We were there rehearsing and these girls came in and I didn't quite remember everything that was said that day because it's been so long. But Mary Wilson of The Supremes, remembered when she was writing her book to say that when she first walked into Motown, the three of them walked in and my question to Berry Gordy was, why are they walking in on my rehearsal, because all of our rehearsals were private. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : (Singing) It takes a more than 'em flashy old money and I wink from the corner of your eye. I don't want no big line calls, (unintelligible) caviar. Oh no, true love baby can be found 'cause you take a look around. TONY COX, host : Talking about faith. Your career at Motown never really took off, and after some few years, you decided to go to Memphis, where you joined the Stax label and hooked up with Porter and Isaac Hayes. And then, it was long after that that you had a million seller. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : Right. Well, Motown, Berry Gordy, they were all along with God and my parents a part of my future. So Motown was my beginning. It was one that was different from everywhere else I've ever been. But I think it was a necessary one to make the transition for me from Motown to Stax. TONY COX, host : Now, your big song at Stax, one of your - the biggest of your songs was\u2026 Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : The biggest of all songs. TONY COX, host : \"Your Good Thing is About to End.\" Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : \"\u2026Is About to End.\" Right. Right. TONY COX, host : See, I'm old enough to have remembered that song. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : Well, that's good. That makes me feel you don't have to be very old to remember that. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : (Singing) I don't have to beg you to hold me 'cause somebody else will. You don't have to love me when I want it, 'cause somebody else will. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : It was a story that I needed to tell because of a bad marriage. And at Stax, they would allow you to be yourself. Everybody participated in whatever success you're going to have, everybody, including the drummer. TONY COX, host : Really? Tell me about your family. And I'm switching to that for a reason because you were one of 10 children, right? Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : The oldest\u2026 TONY COX, host : The oldest of 10. Ms. MABLE JOHN (Singer) : \u2026of 10 children. TONY COX, host : And you happen to have a little brother, a baby brother who was a big time performer, Little Willie John.

And we could play to any audience. I wanted to sing what was in my heart to everybody that loves music, and Ray Charles was the place for me to be, to do that. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's time now for our Africa update. This week, escalating violence in Somalia, plus rising political tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the latest on the north-south dispute in Sudan. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we've got Bill Fletcher, a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies and former president of TransAfrica Forum. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi, Bill. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : Hey, glad to be back. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah, great to have you on. So, let's talk - we're really talking about the east of the continent and the last week, dozens people have been killed in heavy fighting in and around Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. Tens of thousands of people have fled the area, journalists have been killed, Ethiopian troops were killed as well, and one dead soldier's body was dragged through the streets. What's behind all these violence? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : The invasion has failed. The Ethiopian invasion, fundamentally, has failed. The transitional government that was put in is attempting to suppress opposition, not just the Islamists, but also trying to suppress the media itself, and so tension is arising. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give us a little bit of background - just briefly, we've talked about this. But on the question of the Ethiopians being in Somalia, give us the backgrounder on that. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : The Union of Islamic Courts, an Islamist group, which is something along the lines of the Taliban, succeeded in taking over some - a good chunk of Somalia and restricting the ability of the clans to create chaos. The Ethiopian government was deeply worried about the situation there. There has been historical antagonisms between Ethiopia and Somalia. And with the apparent encouragement of the U.S. government, the Bush administration, Ethiopia invaded Somalia, routed the Union of Islamic Courts and everyone thought that that was that - or at least many people thought that was that. The Islamists regrouped and they've been conducting a guerilla war against Ethiopians and the Somali allies. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, last week, Ethiopia deployed 2,000 more troops to Mogadishu. Some people blame the violence on the resentment towards the Ethiopian troops who monitor the area. What about civilians? How were they caught in this conflict? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : There has been a humanitarian disaster that's been unfolding in Somalia, massive emigration of people out of Mogadishu - the United Nations is very worried - and in addition, Somalia has not been receiving the sorts of international aid that it needs to deal with the civilian refugees. So the situation is quite dramatic and unfortunately, it's not getting the kind of attention it needs here in the United States. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you have Ethiopia and Somalia, and now you have Ethiopia and Eritrea - neighboring nations. Is this a border war? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : This is one of the greatest tragedies of the last decade. Here you have two countries that's succeeded in building a - something close to a partnership through the overthrow of the Ethiopian junta that was called the Derg in early '90s. Eritrea achieved independence, and there was collaboration, and there was even talk of some sort of regional alignment that could take place between the two countries. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : And then things started to unravel. And it's basically - what seems to be at route is a level of political opportunism that first emerged in Ethiopia, but now, I must say, also in Eretria, where the leadership is trying desperately to hold on to power, and it's fanning the flames of nationalism and war. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What territory are they really fighting over? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : It's an area that's almost a - there's really almost nothing there. It's 25 kilometers round in a town called Badme, B-A-D-M-E. And it's not exactly what you'd call an oasis. And that's why many observers, in looking at the situation, say, no, no, no. This is not about the territory. This is about something else. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : And unfortunately, I think that the something else is that it becomes a convenient means for the Ethiopian government, which refuses to implement the border commission resolution of the crisis. It becomes a means for them to rally the troops against the evil bogeymen in Eritrea. It's almost like the beginning of World War I. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Are you saying then that this is, in some ways, a fictional conflict -a real conflict with nothing more than mutual animosity fueling it? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies; Former President, TransAfrica Forum) : It's close to a fictional conflict. What's at stake, what's being said that's at stake really does not pass the straight-face test. The Ethiopians are clearly violating the agreement that was established by the border commission. That is true. At the same time, the Eritreans are not permitting peacekeepers to fully observe the territory that's in dispute. So when you have a situation like that, and you have two very well-armed militaries, you have a recipe for a potential disaster. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Ethiopia has been considered a key U.S. ally in the war on terrorism, and Eritrea has been considered as possibly being added to the list of states that sponsor terrorism.

MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand. Although oil prices have actually dropped a little bit over the last two weeks, gas prices have not and four dollars a gallon? That's a reality in many U.S. cities. ALEX CHADWICK, host : How about the equivalent of nine dollars a gallon? That's what British motorists are paying. And like drivers here in this country, many are very unhappy about the price. Here's a little sample of opinion from London. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male #1: Basically we will moan and groan and everything else, but when it comes actually to doing something about it, we let it be. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male #2: I mean what the price of fuel's gone up over a pound in not even a year? ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male #3: Yeah, it's getting a bit on the ridiculous side. Not much we can do about it. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male  #1: It's just a rip off. It's going up about a penny every day. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male #4: I think the government should cut the rate of tax on fuel. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Unidentified Male  #1: You know if I had my fare going up a penny everyday, I'd be a millionaire. ALEX CHADWICK, host : British motorists complaining about the high price of fuel in that country. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Here in the States, while consumers are worrying about prices, some lawmakers are trying to tackle global climate change. In southern California, a lawmaker is pushing a plan that would reduce greenhouse gasses and road congestion. Nate Berg reports. NATE BERG : At more than four dollars a gallon, gas prices are already too high for many Angelinos. But a new bill moving its way through the state legislature could push that price up another nine cents. All that loose change would add up to create a county public transportation fund worth more than 400 million dollars a year. Mr. MIKE FEUER (Democrat, California State Assembly) : The status quo is not acceptable. NATE BERG : That's Mike Feuer a Democrat in the California state Assembly. He represents Los Angeles and is the author of the bill. Mr. MIKE FEUER (Democrat, California State Assembly) : No one would say that we can be sanguine about the impact of global warming. No one would say that L.A. status as the number one sore place for air pollution in the country ought to continue to be so. And no one would say we have a muscular public transport infrastructure here in Los Angeles. The question is what are we going to do about it? NATE BERG : What he wants to do is let LA's transit agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority bring his funding idea before the county's voters. The MTA can either ask voters to support the gas fee, or an additional fee of up to ninety dollars on their annual car registrations. The money it raises would fund public transit projects and programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In a county with nearly six million registered drivers, getting enough voters behind the bill will be a challenge. But Feuer thinks it can be done and now's the time to do it. Mr. MIKE FEUER (Democrat, California State Assembly) : For the first time here in Los Angeles there's a real openness to thinking in new ways about how we get from one place to another. I clearly think the time is right here because of that awareness, to try and give voters these kinds of choices. NATE BERG : But for industries that rely on gasoline, a rise in price is a tough sell. Mr. ANTOINE ROYSTER (Board of Directors, Greater California Livery Association) : You're asking one segment to help another segment I think it's just unfair. NATE BERG : Antoine Royster is on the board of directors of the Greater California Livery Association, which represent limousine drivers in California. Los Angeles is a major market for limos and when gas prices rise, limo prices rise. \n\n ###",

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I'm Alex Chadwick.  Coming up.  Senator John McCain says Senator Barack Obama will change his mind on the war if he comes to Baghdad with Senator McCain.  We'll hear more in our weekly chat with Juan Williams. MADELEINE BRAND, host : First, sorting out the Democrats.  Party leaders from across the country are gathering in Washington tomorrow for a meeting that can resolve the long battle for the presidential nomination.  At stake, nearly 400 delegates from Michigan and Florida, two states that broke party rules by holding primaries ahead of schedule. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Senator Clinton won flawed victories in both contests, and now, what to do?  The Democratic Party has a Rules Committee to sort out these disputes.  A prominent Seattle attorney, David McDonald, is on it.  He's also an undeclared superdelegate.  David, we spoke by phone late yesterday.  You said you'd just gotten to Washington, that you were learning a lot and that things are evolving. What can you tell us? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : They have not evolved very far as far as I can I tell you.  It sounds like there is no clear consensus emerging anywhere at this point, and we'll be probably addressing this most of the day tomorrow. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So, there will be a meeting, and there are no deals yet going into it. Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : Not that I'm aware of. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Here's from the Huffington Post today from long-time political reporter Tom Edsel writing there, quote, \"The major dispute over the Florida and Michigan delegations to the convention has now boiled down to Hillary Clinton's demand for full seeding with no sanctions.\" And he goes on, \"the Clinton proposal now faces tough, if not insurmountable, odds.\"  Is that how you read things? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : I think it's very unlikely that we would simply say never mind about Florida and Michigan. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So what do you then say? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : I think the issue is whether we can lift part of the sanction in recognition of the fact that eventually these two state parties did actually try to get into compliance, and we may be able to lift part of the sanction on the basis of simply acknowledging that effort.  I don't know whether that's going to work. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Here's something I've gleaned from looking around political websites today, this is from First Read at MSNBC.  It says the most likely compromise would give Senator Clinton most of the Florida delegates but split Michigan 50-50.  Have you heard about this compromise, and what is appealing about it? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : I don't think I've heard about it.  What would be appealing about at least part of it is when all else fails, people tend to simply divide things.  I don't mean to be flip, but putting aside all of the other rules and issues, the difficulty in states that did not hold a process that met the rules, is trying to estimate what would have happened if they had held a process, and that's part of the problem.  If you decided you would do something, how would you select the people, and who would they be pledged to, and so on. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Well, what are you thinking about?  What could you offer to this group of people tomorrow as a compromise, as a way out of this? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : Assuming that the two state parties actually did make good faith efforts to try to get themselves into compliance, I would consider lifting part of the sanction, and give them some delegates.  I personally would probably prefer to do it with fractional votes in order to have more people come and see the convention, rather than have fewer people with full votes.  I do not see giving full votes to the full delegation though. ALEX CHADWICK, host : But what about that issue of where did those votes go?  I mean that's really the crucial thing, isn't it? Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : I still need to listen to arguments on that.  It's a difficult issue because there's no data to base an answer on.  I suppose one could say if there's no data, then just treat it as the average state, and see what the other 48 did on aggregate, but I don't know what that result would lead to. ALEX CHADWICK, host : You're having lunch today with one of your law partners there in Washington. Mr. DAVID MCDONALD (Attorney, Democratic Superdelegate) : Yes. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And you told me he's going to be talking about the same thing that everyone you talked to for the next 24 hours.  How many meetings do you have scheduled today with other members of the Rules Committee, and what are you doing to get together, and try to figure out what to do? \n\n ###",

Somewhere off the coast of California, two men are sailing to Hawaii on a boat made of plastic bottles. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Plastic bottles? MADELEINE BRAND, host : Not only plastic bottles, but recycled old plastic bottles, 15,000 of them. Marine scientists Joel Paschal and Marcus Erikson, they built a boat, really it's kind of like a raft, entirely out of these plastic bottles and other junk. The purpose of their voyage is to call attention of the growing mass of plastic that's polluting the oceans. I went out to meet them at the Long Beach Harbor just before they set sail on a voyage that will take at least six weeks. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Are you good friends? Mr. JOEL PASCHAL (Marine Scientist) : We will be. Mr. JOEL PASCHAL (Marine Scientist) : We were hoping to rebuild the friendship. MADELEINE BRAND, host : These two scientists say in their marine work they witnessed a huge floating mass of plastic that collects in a sort of eddy in the Pacific. Here's Marcus Erikson. Dr. MARCUS ERIKSON (Marine Scientist) : The vortex is called the North Pacific gyre. It extends from 500 miles off the coast of California to 200 miles off the coast of Japan. It's actually entire North Pacific Ocean is a swirling mass of water called a gyre, and it's full of plastic from end to end. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Where does it come from, this plastic? Dr. MARCUS ERIKSON (Marine Scientist) : Eighty percent comes from land. Twenty percent comes from the fishing industry, maritime industry. Most of it's from us. We have very quick, in the last two decades, become a throwaway society. Plastic bags, plastic bottles, bottle caps, cups and straws, coffee cup lids. All this junk that didn't exist really 25 years ago is now commonplace everywhere. And the idea you throw something away, well, where is away? There is no away. And we're finding it in the middle of the ocean. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Marcus and Joel were so shocked, well, disgusted really by the sight of all this plastic, they decided to pull off a kind of stunt, something that would bring attention to the problem. And so they built this raft from junk, they even named this raft \"Junk.\" Floating on plastic bottles, the base of the raft is made of old sailing masts, they're lashed together. And the cabin, it's a fuselage from an old Cessna prop plane. Dr. MARCUS ERIKSON (Marine Scientist) : So you have the airplane sitting on top of sail boat masts sitting on top of 15,000 plastic bottles held together with old fishing nets. MADELEINE BRAND, host : The raft is maybe 12 feet wide, 20 feet long. It doesn't look all that seaworthy, but Marcus' partner Joel assures me it is. MADELEINE BRAND, host : You're hoping to stop the addition of more plastic into the ocean right, because... Mr. JOEL PASCHAL (Marine Scientist) : It's the only fix I can see right now. MADELEINE BRAND, host : You can't do anything about the plastic that's already there? Mr. JOEL PASCHAL (Marine Scientist) : We get lot's of people call every day that are really eager to come up with some technological fix, to take a bunch of huge boats up there and seine out the whole ocean. Of course, you'd scoop up all the life in it in the process and burn up all the rest of the oil left on earth doing a lawnmower pattern across the whole Pacific Ocean. It's not practical. People really want - people really crave this technological fix and really it's a behavioral fix. When Paul is here, a legislative fix. So, we just have to stop using plastic the way we do right now. It takes we think about five years for plastic trash that's floating in this harbor here to work it's way out to the middle of the Pacific gyre. So there's still a large amount of momentum in this system. If we stopped right now, it's going to increase over the next five years. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Joel Paschal along with Marcus Erikson. They're sailing a plastic bottle raft to Hawaii, and they hope to reach Oahu some time in mid July. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Madeleine, did you actually get on this boat?

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And I'm Madeleine Brand. Most people agree that something must be done about global warming. Today, the Senate takes up a massive bill that would cut greenhouse gas emissions by about two-thirds by the year 2050. The Climate Security Act has bipartisan support and support from industry as well as some major environmental groups. However, this bill has virtually no chance of passing. And to find out why, we called up Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Ball. Jeff, first tell us broadly what's in this bill. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, what's in this bill is something that affects essentially everyone in the economy from every industry in the economy to regular consumers. Broadly what this does is put a cap on emissions of global warming gasses, notably carbon dioxide which is produced whenever a fossil fuel like oil or coal is burned. So fundamentally what this bill does is create higher prices to consume the sort of energy that powers everything in this economy. And as a result of that what you have is a huge food fight in Washington over the details of this, which are really going to determine who gets hit the hardest. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And who's for it and who's against it? Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, one thing is that this fight is often described as a partisan fight with Democrats versus Republicans. And really it's not that. It's really a regional fight. Energy politics and environmental politics in this country, like around the world, are mostly regional. Where people are in the Congress, just like out in the country, depends on what kind of fuel they use for electricity largely. So coal-state Senators, whether Democrat or Republican are likely to be at a different place in this debate than Senators say from the North-East and California who get most of their electricity from natural gas or nuclear energy, which is less emitting than coal. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : And the other thing is that there are very different positions even within industries. You have interesting splits, say, between the auto industry on the one hand and the oil industry on the other hand. There's a very broad group called the US Climate Action Partnership, which is based in Washington. And interestingly, represents companies sort of across the industrial spectrum. I mean, among its members are General Electric and General Motors, both of whom make equipment that is used in activities that produce quite a lot of emissions. And you might not expect them to support this bill, but they do, and basically the reason is that they figure that like it or not, they're going to get hit with a climate bill, and they better be involved early on in shaping it so that they can shape it to their advantage. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : The other thing is that if you look at this bill itself, you see this fascinating sort of matrix of slicing the pie. So this bill actually names a broad group of constituencies and parses out how much of these pollution permits that the bill would create would be divvied up among these various constituencies. And this is a big, big economic issue, because these permits are expected to be worth something like perhaps 25 dollars apiece. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : These are permits, each of which allows its bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, if this bill is passed, when it takes effect. And each of these things, if it's worth 25 dollars apiece, will collectively be worth more than 100 billion dollars in the first year of this bill. And so to the degree that any constituency gets these things, it can either use them to lessen its cost of compliance, or it can actually sell them on the market and make money. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : And so this is largely seen as an environmental bill, but fundamentally this is sort of like a tax bill. It's an economic bill with huge stakes and essentially everyone who uses energy in this economy is at the federal bar trying to maximize his take. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And this is why the group Friends of the Earth is opposed to it, because they see it as a big giveaway to polluters. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, right. I mean, lots of - groups who are opposed to this on the environmental side think that it's too soft. One big debate is whether the quote unquote \"big polluters\" ought to be given a chunk of their pollution permits or whether they ought to have to pay for all of them. There was a big fight in Europe, which created a system like this a couple of years ago, where there was a sense that large emitting companies got windfall profits. That is they were given permits for free and still electricity prices rose and their profits rose as well. There were investigations into that, and that hangs as a specter over this whole discussion in the US. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So this is supported by, or sponsored by Republican John Warner of Virginia and former Democrat, now independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. So these two are veterans of the Senate. You would think that they could bring along enough Senators with them. Why can't they? Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Well, remember two things about where we are on June 2nd, 2008. We are facing four dollar a gallon gasoline at the pump, and we're five months away from a presidential election. Both of those things ultimately argue against passing a climate bill, and here's why. First of all, again everyone agrees that on some level passing a climate cap bill is going to increase energy prices, including ultimately increasing gasoline prices at some level. Now there are many studies that say it won't be too much. Studies disagree on this, but nevertheless it's not a message that a politician wants to deliver to a consumer today. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Secondly, they particularly don't want to deliver that message as the presidential election heats up. And it's interesting that all three leading presidential candidates apparently will not be in the Senate today for this debate. Now they all say that they have reasons not to be there, but it is sort of interesting to note because at some level this climate bill has been a subject of discussion on the campaign trail. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Yeah, I mean, interestingly, John McCain has recently said that he says global warming is real and something needs to be done about it. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Right. And they all essentially say that, but then when you parse the details, they're all very careful and they've become increasingly careful in recent weeks not to say that anything should be done at all costs. I mean, I think most of them say that things should be done such that it doesn't kill the economy. And that's a big caveat, which leaves a lot open to interpretation. Because look, at the end of the day, in order to win the presidency, any of these candidates is going to need support from states that depend heavily on fossil fuels. I mean, notably coal states. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : And it's pretty clear that depending on how this thing shakes out, coal states are going to get hit harder than other states. There are provisions in this bill that would seek to address that, to sort of parse out some more largesse as compensation to coal states. But, you know, this debate largely has been had in this country so far in a very esoteric, general 30,000-foot level. And I think what we're about to see is this debate get had on a more detailed level. And when that happens people are going to start to realize that there's not a free lunch here. And that's not going to be a politically popular realization, probably. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So you expect it not to pass this week, but perhaps after November it might be revived. Mr. JEFFREY BALL (Reporter, Wall Street Journal) : Yeah, I think the consensus is that - well, consensus broadly is that it won't pass this year, and it'll be taken up again probably next year and maybe it'll pass next year, maybe the year after that. MADELEINE BRAND, host : We've been talking about the big global warming bill debated this week in the Senate with Jeff Ball. He's a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Jeff, thank you. \n\n ###",

ALEX CHADWICK, host : In the spring of the year when college grads go off to work or maybe one more summer off, they receive a lot of advice. The centerpiece of course, the commencement address. MADELEINE BRAND, host : We wondered if people actually remember that advice that they received, five, 10 or 25 years after they graduate, or even if they remember who the speaker was.

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand.  In a few minutes, we talk about the fashions in the \"Sex and the City\" movie and what's hot this summer. ALEX CHADWICK, host : First, Texas officials have collected DNA from Warren Jeffs, he's the polygamous sect leader.  He's awaiting trial in an abuse case for his spiritual marriages to teenage girls.  Meanwhile, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in a different case involving the FLDS sect.  More than 400 children were taken from the sect's ranch by child protective services.  They were placed in foster care, but now the court says they should be returned to their parents. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Patrick Crimmins is spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.  Mr. Crimmins, what is your reaction to this ruling and what will you do today? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : Well, the first thing that has to happen is Judge Walter has to act.  The ruling did not order Child Protective Services directly to return the children, so what happens next is up to Judge Walter. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So this court, the Texas Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals both said that what your agency did was really overstep your bounds, that the removal of all these children was not warranted, what do you say to that? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : Well, you know, from the very beginning, we only had one goal, and it's a goal that Child Protective Services always has and that's to protect children.  And again, we were disappointed with the ruling as we were disappointed with the earlier court ruling, but we acted appropriately.  We believe, given the information that we had at the time and given what our investigation found when we went to the YFC ranch. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Which was that five teenagers were pregnant, is that right? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : Well, there's quite a bit more to it than that, I mean, I don't want to go into it again, right now. MADELEINE BRAND, host : But that is a key point in this whole dispute is that the Court of Appeals found that there was evidence that you presented, only five teenage girls were pregnant and did not warrant the removal of all the children on basically a suspicion that they might be abused sometime in the future. Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : You're picking out one or two sentences from what the Court of Appeals said. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, do you think that that's an erroneous interpretation? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : No, absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  It's just that I don't want to talk about the court rulings.  The court rulings are something that have happened, has already happened, and we just need to move forward. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, is there any other recourse, then, besides reuniting the children? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : Well, it depends on what Judge Walter does and as far as how that affects the investigation that's currently going on, you know there is an active abuse neglect investigation going on now.  I mean, it had not concluded.  You know, it's interesting to know the Supreme Court did not direct the agency to end the investigation, but you know, it's difficult to know exactly what's going to happen. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Are you worried at all that this might compromise future child abuse investigations? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : That's something that is being discussed a great deal in all kinds of circles--legal and social services and government and otherwise--as to what effect this whole, you know, two-month long experience will have on how Child Protective Services in Texas and perhaps elsewhere, conduct investigations, how they respond to complaints. MADELEINE BRAND, host : What are some of the possible outcomes do you think? Mr. PATRICK CRIMMINS (DFPS, Spokesman) : It's impossible to say.  I mean, again, Child Protective Services in Texas, like any CPS in any state, has to operate a great deal on judgments and a great deal on, you know, risk assessment rules and risk assessment models and in any case in which you respond to a report of possible child abuse or child neglect in a household, if you find abuse or neglect in that household a CPS investigator is trained that if one child in a household has been abused then the other children in that household may be at risk of abuse. So it may be in the best interest of everyone in the household to remove all the children. That's the model that we operated under in the YFC case.  And the court says that that model, that risk assessment decision-making, was flawed, and you can't remove all the children in a given household just because you believe one or more of them have been abused or neglected, and so that's something that is causing a great deal of interest in social service circles.

DAVID GREENE, HOST : Well, that question remains after a judge ruled that Manafort did intentionally lie. He had a plea deal with the special counsel investigating Russia's involvement in U.S. politics. He was supposed to give truthful information. Robert Mueller says he did not. And the judge's agreement means his plea deal is done. Democrats have a theory as to why. Adam Schiff is chair of the House Intelligence Committee. ADAM SCHIFF : It's not just that if he told the truth, it would be damaging to Manafort. But it would reflect so adversely on the president that he would lose his chance of a pardon. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That is one theory. What can we learn from the nature of the lies? NPR Justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is on the line once again. Carrie, good morning. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : What exactly did Manafort lie about? CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : Judge Amy Berman Jackson found that Paul Manafort lied about a payment to a law firm that apparently did some work for him, about some other unrelated criminal investigation, and then here's the most important thing. Judge Jackson found Manafort lied about the nature of his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence. They had meetings and conversations throughout the campaign, and even after the campaign, after the inauguration and into 2018 that prosecutors say were at the heart of this investigation into Russian election interference and whether any Americans helped. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Wow. So this is Paul Manafort's conversations with a guy linked to Russian intelligence. I'm just making sure I understand this. And you're saying that Paul Manafort lied about talking with this person throughout the presidential campaign, where Manafort was campaign chairman for President Trump for a while, and even continued after the election for a good while. So are we able to learn anything from - anything true from knowing which lies he told? CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : Well, you know, a lot of the proceedings in this matter have been sealed. We're eventually getting transcripts, which have a lot of blacked-out versions or redactions. We do know that prosecutors think that Manafort passed some kind of polling data to this person the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence, that they had a meeting in August 2016 at the heart of the campaign. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : And we also know this, Steve - that Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort's right-hand man and deputy, has been cooperating for a lot longer than Paul Manafort. Prosecutors are taking this information from Richard Gates, who also was around the campaign, the inauguration and the Trump White House, and contrasting it with what Manafort has told them to help determine that Manafort has lied about matters central to this investigation into what happened with the Russians and Americans in 2016. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : In order to know that Manafort lied, you need to know at least some of the truth. I don't want to connect these dots too firmly yet, Carrie, but I want to note what some of the dots are. You're saying that Manafort is suspected of passing polling information to Russians. That's one dot. We know that Russians were using internet troll farms and other methods to pass propaganda messages to the United States during the election. What would it mean if those dots were more firmly connected? CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : I think we're going to need to wait and see what Robert Mueller and the FBI investigators have found rather than speculate about what might be out there. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Good point. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : There's been a lot of bad reporting in this case. We got to be careful. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : But what we do know is those dots are there and that the Mueller investigation continues. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : That's - yes, that's right. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Carrie, thanks so much. Really appreciate it. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE : My pleasure. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Carrie Johnson.

This morning, I'm in Broward County, Fla., Steve, just a few miles or so from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where that mass shooting claimed 17 lives a year ago. And since then, as we know, young Parkland survivors have really emerged as a driving force calling for stricter gun laws across the United States. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Some of them have become quite prominent across the country. So how is the community marking this moment, David? DAVID GREENE, HOST : I mean, I think when you - one thing you could say is this is not going to be a normal day here. They've made attendance not mandatory at the high school. And you hear from many parents who are saying they're not going to have their kids go to school. They're going to have them close with them at home to spend the day. DAVID GREENE, HOST : At 10:17 a.m., there's going to be a moment of silence planned to honor the 17 people killed a year ago. And many schools across the state of Florida are expected to join in that. And there's a commemoration tonight in a park that's just a few blocks from the school. And that's the same spot where a vigil took place a year ago, and 17 crosses were put up. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : We've been following your reporting and the reporting of an NPR team on social media, David, and seeing these really quite memorable photographs of young people in the sunshine in Florida reflecting on this event. What are you hearing? DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. I mean, you know, for one thing, if you remember the youth movement that was really born from the tragedy to combat gun violence - and we spoke to one of the leaders of that movement, David Hogg. He's now graduated from the school. He's moving on to Harvard. He says he's excited about college. But you know, he's sounding as determined as ever to keep the fight on even as he is spending more time in New England than down here. And you know, we talked to a theater director, Steve, who's trying to create a space for students to come in and create theater and art and have a place to kind of let steam off. DAVID GREENE, HOST : And I also spoke to a young man, Patrick Petty. He lost his sister, Alaina, in the shooting. And he was remembering how he and his sister used to go to the shooting range together. PATRICK PETTY : That's something that my sister and I bonded over and something that we both enjoyed doing. And I can remember seeing the smile on her face the first time she went shooting and the first time she was learning. She really enjoyed it. DAVID GREENE, HOST : And so you know, I asked Patrick if his views have changed about guns since his sister was killed in a shooting, and he said no. He believes in the Second Amendment as strongly as ever, including the right to own assault weapons like the one that was used in the shooting where his sister was killed. But he said he has become a little more open to listening to people on the other side of the gun debate, is more open to conversation, which was interesting. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. David, there's a bit of news I want to ask about. The governor of Florida, if I have this correctly, has asked for a grand jury investigation in response to demands for accountability, specifically holding accountable the county superintendent of schools in Broward County. Haven't you spoken with him? DAVID GREENE, HOST : I have, yeah. Robert Runcie, the superintendent here, has been under a lot of criticism. And the new governor, Ron DeSantis, called for this grand jury to investigate school security across the state, but especially here in Broward County. There's been so much anger, Steve, among the families of Parkland victims who don't think that the superintendent reached out to them enough over the past year. They don't think he's moved quickly enough to put new security measures in place. DAVID GREENE, HOST : When I sat down with Runcie, I mean, he told me that you can't rush security measures just because it's in response to a tragedy, that they have to be carefully thought out. And he also took a moment to apologize to families who don't think that he has been there for them. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, David, thanks for being there for us. We are listening to your coverage on NPR News from Parkland this week. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Some other news now. How much damage did a former U.S. Air Force officer do to national security? DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. Monica Witt - she defected to Iran back in 2013 and now the former U.S. Air Force counterintelligence officer - is being accused of providing secrets to the Tehran government. There's a federal indictment that says she disclosed the code name and the secret mission of a Pentagon program for hackers linked to the Iranian government, who've now also been charged. And they allegedly tried to install spy software on computers that belonged to Witt's colleagues. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : All of this allegedly happened years ago, but we're just learning about it now. And NPR's Peter Kenyon is covering the story. Peter tracks Iran for us. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE : Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : What exactly was Witt working on when she was with the Air Force? PETER KENYON, BYLINE : Well, she started in '97. She worked there until 2008. The indictment does not give the exact nature of what she was working on, but she did learn Farsi early on. She joined then the Office for Special Investigation - that's counterintelligence. The indictment says that Witt came to the FBI's attention after she traveled to Iran and appeared in a video criticizing the U.S. She told the agents, I'm not going to divulge any sensitive information. Don't worry. And she passed a series of U.S. security and background checks. PETER KENYON, BYLINE : But the indictment says she began working with a so-called talent spotter for Iranian intelligence. Then, in 2013, she told her story at the Iranian embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. And then, in late August of that year, she flew to Tehran. \n\n ###",

DAVID GREENE, HOST : You know, thinking about what's changed and what hasn't over the past year, there's this new NPR poll we have out this morning suggesting that around the country, the outcry over gun violence has lessened. And I wonder - I mean, here, is the youth movement that was begun by students here - is it still going strong? CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : Yes and no. The March for Our Lives movement, I mean, obviously took the entire country by storm this time last year after the shooting. And immediately, you had marches across the country. And here, a year later, I mean, it's just quieter activism. So it's not going to be going at the same rate it was when we had the big march in D.C. CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : But, I mean, for an example, just this week, David Hogg, who's a key figure in the March for Our Lives movement, he went to the Broward County Elections Office and helped file 200 signed petitions in an effort to get started, over the next year, trying to get a constitutional amendment on Florida's ballot in 2020 to ban the sale of assault-style weapons. DAVID GREENE, HOST : So still - still active. But... CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : Still active. DAVID GREENE, HOST : ...We should say, one thing you've reported on is that there are different views of guns in this part of Florida. CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : Absolutely. I think a lot of people might expect, because Parkland is the center of this March for Our Lives pro-gun-control movement, that it's in some way not a gun-owning community. And that's not true. It's really split, 50-50. And that split shows, not just through families but through all of this advocacy here. There's a big portion of people that own guns. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Well, and in a second, we're going to hear another perspective on guns. You actually put us in touch with the young man, so I want to thank you for that and for your reporting. Caitie Switalski from member station WLRN. CAITIE SWITALSKI, BYLINE : Thank you, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST : The young man that she introduced me to is Patrick Petty. He's a student at Stoneman Douglas, and his younger sister, Alaina, was killed there. And I asked him to tell me about her. PATRICK PETTY : We fought, screamed, yelled at each other plenty of times over stupid things. But overall, we - we really started building a bond the past couple of years and got to be better friends and got to learn about each other. And we actually had pretty similar interests. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Patrick is 18 years old. He wants to go to West Point and be a military officer. And he's always supported the Second Amendment. I asked him if that's changed at all since his sister was killed. PATRICK PETTY : After the shooting last year, my dad and I, we both looked at our views and thought about the Second Amendment a lot and thought about what it means to us and whether or not we still supported it and whether or not some of the things that we had supported for our entire lives, whether or not we supported those things still, or whether or not we had a - we had a change of heart. And we came out of it, I'd say, pretty much the same, if not stronger in our support for the Second Amendment. \n\n ###",

Ms. PARKER : (As Carrie Bradshaw) The next day, over dessert, I was still not over the fact that my shoes had deserted me.  These were new Manolos.  I hadn't even done a full lap around the party and you know, I don't play favorites with my shoes but these were very special. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Carrie Bradshaw played by Sarah Jessica Parker obsessed with the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik.  Women going to see the movie \"Sex and the City\" this weekend are as curious about Carrie's shoes as they are about her wedding to Mr. Big.  Najwa Moses, Day to Day's fashion contributor, is in New York and she's been doing some hard-hitting research there on the streets of New York City.  Hi, Najwa. NAJWA MOSES : Hi, Madeleine.  I think you forgot one M.  Men. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And Moses. NAJWA MOSES : And Moses. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So you spoke with the shoe expert who went to the \"Sex and the City\" red carpet premiere event, and I guess the shoe expert was looking down at that red carpet to see what the ladies were wearing. NAJWA MOSES : Oh, yes.  Well, actually, I spoke with Miss Meghan, aka, Meghan Cleary.  She's America's shoe expert and actually, the carpet was pink.  When I speak to her a little about you know, what the girls were wearing on their feet, Kim Cattrall, kept it real with Jimmy Choos, and she had on a basket weave, metallic basket weave stilettos.  Basket weave is going to be a huge, huge trend for the summer as well as for the fall.  So, get on top of that.  Have a lot of fun with that. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I will. NAJWA MOSES : And as for S.J.P. a.k.a. Carrie Bradshaw, Ms. Meghan lets us know exactly what she had on. Ms. MEGHAN CLEARY (Shoe Expert) : I had a little friend inside the Sarah Jessica camp who let me know that her shoes were Givenchy golden, peep-toe, ankle-boot stilettos. Ms. MEGHAN CLEARY (Shoe Expert) : BRAND  Oh, my gosh!  I don't even know what to do with that, Najwa. NAJWA MOSES : Let's just talk about this for a minute.  She wore ankle boots on the pink carpet.  It's a revolution.  It's all about the ankle boots.  It's all about the ankle boots, friends. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And I'm just wondering, has \"Sex and the City\" jumped the shark there in Manhattan?  Are people sick of S.J.P. and all her friends? NAJWA MOSES : Absolutely not. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK. NAJWA MOSES : From the premiere where 1,500 people actually got locked out, to last night.  Actually I  was passing, just walking in the streets about 12 o'clock midnight, and people were lined up at the theaters.  Gaggles and groups of girls had just come from having cosmos.  People are ultra-excited.  You've got people taking days off.  You've got bloggers calling it \"Sex and the City\" Day. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Today, being \"Sex and the City\" Day? NAJWA MOSES : Today is \"Sex and the City\" Day.  I call it \"Sex and the City\" Day. And I think people around the blogosphere are also calling it \"Sex and the City\" Day.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : President Trump is set to sign a bill this morning that would fund the federal government and prevent a second shutdown but... MITCH MCCONNELL : He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. And I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Republican Mitch McConnell made that announcement on the Senate floor. It is worth noting when McConnell said this, what he said and who was saying it. The Senate was about to vote on a border security defeat for the president. Lawmakers approved the bill without billions for a border wall. McConnell said the president will claim emergency powers to spend the money that Congress denied him. It's striking that McConnell was the one to support this end run around Congress since he is a leader in Congress and was widely reported to have - was widely reported to have advised the president not to do this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR's congressional correspondent Susan Davis is in the studio with us this morning, along with national security correspondent David Welna, who's on the line. Good morning to you both. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Good morning. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : David, let's start with you. By declaring a national emergency, what specific authorities does that give the president? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : It gives him potentially many authorities. There are hundreds of statutes that Congress has been approving since the time of George Washington that lie dormant most of the time. They are only activated when the president declares a national emergency. By law, he has to cite which specific statutes he's going to be using. But when he does use these statutes, there's really no definition that Congress has ever given for what constitutes a national emergency. So it'd be hard to challenge him on the grounds that, no, this doesn't fall within what we consider a national emergency. Congress does have ways to block a national emergency. Both chambers would have to vote to do that and then send that to the president for him to sign. And if he doesn't, they'd have to override a veto from him. So really this sort of opens the way for him to tap those powers and try to get the money that Congress refused to give him in this bill that he is expected to sign today. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So, Sue, how is Congress reacting to this? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Well, as Steve noted, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports it, which came as some surprise because we do know from our own reporting that he had expressed private concerns to the White House about this course of action. Not all Republicans are onboard. Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, have said publicly they do not support the president going in this path. Marco Rubio of Florida said that he believed that this could open - set a precedent for future presidents to use. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke to that dynamic. NANCY PELOSI : I'm not advocating for any president doing an end run around Congress. I'm just saying that the Republicans should have some dismay about the door that they are opening, the threshold they are crossing. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Democrats overwhelmingly oppose it. And Pelosi is saying to Republicans, like Marco Rubio, you are right to be concerned. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Because they could use a national emergency - if Democrats could take the White House back, they could declare a national emergency on climate change or gun control or any number of issues. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : And she specifically mentioned gun legislation in her remarks. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what does Congress do in this moment? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : So they have options. The first option is the law that gives the power the president to do this gives Congress the power to take it away. They have the authority to pass resolutions of disapproval that would essentially block the president. The political reality is you would need a veto-proof majority in both chambers to do that, and they probably don't have that because Republicans control the Senate. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : They also can challenge it in the courts. And Democrats are saying they are prepared to do that. How they challenge it goes to what exactly the president does. But remember, there's a constitutional challenge in question here. The Constitution is very clear in Article I that Congress gets to decide how money is appropriated, and the president is challenging what that means. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : But, David, where is the money going to come from? I mean, the White House has suggested that there will be all kinds of pots of money that the national emergency will give the president access to. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : Right. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What pots of money? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : Well, it's most certainly not pots of money coming from Mexico to pay for a wall, despite all the president's earlier promises. These pots of money are all funding that Congress has already approved for other purposes. And mostly they seem to be associated with the Department of Defense, which gets about two-thirds of the money that Congress approves each year. We don't have the specifics yet from the White House, but it appears that Trump is going to try to raid other accounts to add more than $6 billion to the $1.375 billion that Congress has approved for a border barrier for a total of $8 billion. That's a lot more than the $5.7 billion he'd been seeking. And most of that money - $3 1/2 billion - is expected to come from the Pentagon's military construction budget. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : And that's likely to anger a lot of defense hawks on both sides of the aisle because that money was all meant to be spent improving military bases. There's also about $2 1/2 billion in the Defense Department's drug interdiction program that Trump is expected to tap, as well as another $600 million from Treasury's drug forfeiture fund. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wait a minute. So the president has been expressing concern about drug trafficking across the border, and he's going to take away drug trafficking interdiction money in order to build the wall. Is that correct? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : That's right. And I guess he would argue that while this is all about stopping drugs, and that's what the military money was meant for, that's what I'm going to do with it too. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Which is just fascinating - because if if that money were available, they would have appropriated it that way in the first place because, at its core, this is all a spending debate. This is all about creating the budget, as is Congress's writ to do. And if that money had been available, they would have done it the first time. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : Right. And they shortchanged the president on what he wanted. But it was saying basically Congress judges that this is as much money as you should get for this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So there are national emergencies - I mean, it's nothing new, right? And there are dozens that are currently active - is that right, David? What are these? DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : There are dozens that are active. But they're mainly actions that are freezing the assets of foreigners in U.S. banks - that kind of thing. President Trump has actually done a couple of those things. This is very unusual that a president would declare a national emergency to get money that Congress would not give him, effectively making it an end run around Congress. In fact, it's hard to find any other president who's ever done this. So we're in uncharted waters right now. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sue, any inclination as to what happens, like, over the next hours and days? SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : Well, as David said, we really are looking for where exactly the president's going to draw all this money from. Remember. We knew the White House was thinking about this. So Democrats have also been prepared for this. In the response to the State of the Union, one of their responses - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a former member of Congress, cited this national emergency threat and said if the president were to go forward on this, Democrats were prepared, and he would file action in court the day the president signs the declaration. So we're looking for the specifics on it and then who in the Democratic Party are going to bring these suits. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Interesting. I remember interviewing independent Angus King of Maine when the shutdown had just begun. And he predicted, as others did, that the only way that people could save face and keep the government open was this idea of a national emergency. And now they're going to have to deal with it. NPR's Susan Davis and David Welna. Thanks so much, you guys. SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE : You're welcome. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE : You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right. When Amazon announced they were looking for cities to house their new headquarters, it was almost like a popularity contest. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : A very expensive popularity contest. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Indeed. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Cities submitted proposals about all the amazing things they could offer Amazon. And in turn, the corporation promised a lot of jobs and an economic boost. After a long highly publicized search, New York was selected as one of two locations, along with Alexandria outside of Washington, D.C. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was delighted. BILL DE BLASIO : This was unprecedented. And Amazon had a national competition because they had something worth competing for. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : But just three months later, that relationship has come to an end because Amazon announced yesterday that it is canceling the plans for its New York City campus. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR's business correspondent Alina Selyukh joins us in studio to explain why. We should also note Amazon is an NPR underwriter. Alina, good morning. \n\n ###",

Unidentified Man : The Janjaweeds are basically an Arab militia. Some people say that they are the proxy force. That is much of Janjaweed's deed, enormous amount of tribal violence, which is getting the situation increasingly worse. I think it is the responsibility of the government of having opened this Pandora box that I don't think now they have the capacity to close, in order to bring peace to this area. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \"Darfur Now\" follows six people working to bring humanitarian relief and peace to the region. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Twenty-four-year-old Adam Sterling was a college Student in southern California, when he first learned about the situation in Darfur. He says he had to do something to help. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : I was e-mailed a story by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times. He's been one of the most prolific writers on Sudan and Darfur in the last four or five years. And I just had happened to open this one e-mail, and I've read the story, and Nicholas Kristof was visiting one of the refugee camps. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : And looking at the use of rape as a systematic tool in the genocide, and he was speaking to a young mother and he said to this mother, every time you send your daughter out to collect firewood, she's raped. Why don't you send your son? And the response from this mother was, if I send my son, he'll be killed. If I send my daughter, she'll only be raped. And it just blew me away that that type of decision is made in Darfur on a daily basis. And, you know, I thought back the decisions I had made and remembering college, I spent a week deciding whether to get an Xbox or a PlayStation. And it really kind of - I think that was my wake-up call. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You also talk about being someone who wasn't particularly into activism in college. What made the difference for you this time? Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : I think I found a cause that I just I couldn't find an excuse not to get involved in. I mean, Darfur marks the first time in history that a genocide has been labeled the genocide while it's actually still happening. And, you know, I grew up learning about the holocaust and, you know, here we are repeating history again. And I just - I couldn't accept that. And, you know, it started small. A group of us from my class got together and, you know, we didn't wake up and say, we're going to start a global divestment campaign. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : But, I remember our first meeting, there was four of us. And it was the four of us that started the group and our next goal was just to get more people to come to the meeting and kind of just - we would be successful on that and then it was what can we do next, and it's always been what can we do next for the last three years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Explain what you mean by divestment and who you're trying to get to divest. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : Sure. So we, you know, looking at ways that we could kind of impact the situation in Sudan. We looked closely at kind of the Sudanese government and saw that they were really the kind of the ones arming the militias that were conducting the attacks in Darfur and ultimately the ones that were preventing peace and security in Darfur. So we thought, you know, what's the best way to leverage the Sudanese government. And looking at the situation in Sudan, we found that generally, it's a very poor country. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : The average yearly income is around $600 a year. Yet, we found that the Sudanese government was bringing in billions of dollars a year in oil revenue and that money, unfortunately, wasn't going to debt relief. It wasn't going to development. It was going almost all to military spending. And we found that the Sudanese government itself didn't have the capacity or the capital to really take the country's vast oil reserves and turn them into revenues. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : So they brought in all of these foreign oil companies, which then did that work for them. So we found the Sudanese government was incredibly relying on these companies and then we looked at our university investments, our state investments and found that we had millions of dollars invested in these companies. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : So using our ownership in these companies, we basically said to the companies, hey, you've got influence over the Sudanese government, if you don't use that and change your behavior in Sudan, we're going to sell our shares in your company. And that's really kind of what the divestment campaign has been over the last three years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How successful would you say that you've been in those three years? What have you accomplished? Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : It's been really amazing. You know, our first campaign was at the University of California. We were successful there and then we're asked by a state legislator, who said, hey, this is a great idea, help me write a law. And in the last, now, two and half years, 21 states have passed Sudan Divestment Laws, so we're really excited about that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, this is one of a series - \"Darfur Now\" is one the series of films and documentaries that has come out, putting Darfur front and center. Do you think that media, whether it's fiction, non-fiction, can really transform people who may not be that interested in this cause? Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : Absolutely. I think one of the issues is if you're interested about Darfur, up until this point you've really had to seek it out. I remember, you know, I had to really go look for more information about Darfur. And hopefully, with films like \"Darfur Now,\" kind of the information will be given to people and they'll then be faced with the decision to act. And with \"Darfur Now,\" it really - it chose - it's inspirational in that it doesn't just show the genocide; it shows people responding to that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Give me just a quick example of one of the most powerful moments where you thought, okay, I'm really making a difference and one of the moments where you just felt despair. Mr. ADAM STERLING (Resident, California) : You know, I think despair, early on in our campaign, as I said, our first campaign was at the University of California, where you've got UCLA, UC Berkley. There's ten schools and they've got a huge pension fund. When we really first got involved in the divestment campaign, one of our faculty advisers - and this was actually a supporter of us - of ours, took us a aside, a small group of us and said, hey, I think this is great, what you're doing. But, you know, I really - I want to warn you guys, I've been teaching here for many decades, and that the board of trustees they're very conservative and this is just not something they're going to go for. \n\n ###",

Her newest book is part cookbook, part travelogue. It's called \"Zaitoun,\" which is the Arabic word for olive. And both the language and the ingredient are clues to where she takes us. She focuses on the Palestinian kitchen. YASMIN KHAN : Not in any way to kind of silence the Israeli experience, but just to - well, just to enable a space for Palestinian voices to be heard. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yasmin Khan spoke with David Greene. YASMIN KHAN : Usually when we might mention Palestine or Palestinian culture, it's in the context of a very specific and quite fraught political context. So it was so incredible for me to be able to access this other side of Palestinian life - one that encompasses beauty and flavor and texture and joy. DAVID GREENE, HOST : What you - as you started to meet people and research this book - at one point you talked about a meal with a Palestinian nurse in East Jerusalem, who said you can't discuss Palestinian food without talking about the occupation. Talk about that conversation and what you took from it. YASMIN KHAN : Absolutely. And I think - you know, I know from my years of working in the region that in Palestine you can't separate food from politics. You know, a Palestinian's ability to access food is so dependent on their ability to get through checkpoints or their ability to pass through roadblocks. And I think that fragility of everyday life - the uncertainty and the pressures that that brings on ordinary Palestinians is also something I felt was important to convey in the book. You know, I think so many writers go on travel escapades, you know, and travel is seen as such a joyful thing. Here I am in front of a market in a wonderful place - well, that's true. But what I'm interested in is showing you the beauty that exists in the marketplace but also the reality that people face behind that. DAVID GREENE, HOST : What's an example of a dish that is purely Palestinian - that is really distinctive? YASMIN KHAN : Oh, there are so many, but I think my favorite is this dish called musakhan, which is roasted pieces of chicken that are marinated in this - in allspice and cinnamon and cumin and then roasted in the oven and laid over bread topped with, like, gorgeous fried red onions and then sprinkled with loads of sumac to give it a really sharp tang. It's a wonderful sharing food. It's just one that you'll find in Palestinian communities wherever you go. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Well, how does Palestinian food fit into what we've talked about for so long as Middle Eastern cuisine? YASMIN KHAN : One of the things I find very exciting in the food scene at the moment is how we are beginning to break down what Middle Eastern food is. You know, we would never say, oh, well this is European food because we know that European food is filled with all these nuances - German food and Spanish food and Italian food. And we have the same in the Middle East. You know, I'd love us to get to a stage where Middle Eastern food is not just bunched together as one big homogenous bloc but that we get to really get into the nuance of all the different parts of it. DAVID GREENE, HOST : If people are reading your book in the United States and want to make some of these dishes, can people access the ingredients, so they can make these recipes, you know, as authentically as possible? YASMIN KHAN : Absolutely. All the ingredients can be found in U.S. stores. And, you know, Palestinian food certainly isn't you know unattainable. The ingredients we're talking about things you probably already have, but it's just about cooking with them in a different way. So just last night, I was making this Gazan avocado dip, which is, like, smashed avocados with kind of a thick, strained Greek yogurt, some green chili and garlic and dill. And, you know, these are things that we're all kind of used to seeing in our pantry, but putting them together in this way just, you know, helps you elevate a dish in the most fun way. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Am I right? You talked about pickling avocados in the book, right? What does that taste like? And is that a Palestinian tradition? YASMIN KHAN : Yeah. I'm all - you know, pickling and fermenting is such a big part of Palestinian food culture. And, you know, we've all had that moment when you kind of have an avocado at home, and it's a bit firm, but you want to eat it. And you're just like, oh, what do I do - that frustrating moment of impatience. So this is a great recipe where it's a quick pickle - where just in a few hours, you can get a hard avocado into a lovely, creamy, sharp pickle. And, you know, one of the things that I try and do in my book is - yeah, I cover the classic recipes, but I also cover, you know, dishes that represent how modern Palestinian food exists today. So I really try to provide a snapshot of contemporary life for Palestinian communities through their food. DAVID GREENE, HOST : You know, you always think about food and the table, you know, as a place that can bring people together. Is that overly optimistic to think about cuisine in this part of the world as something that might bring people together in a place where there's been so much tension? YASMIN KHAN : I think it's a very good question. Look. I'm not going to sit and pretend that, you know, my books and this work is going to somehow heal all the divisions within the Middle East. But it is undoubtably a universal truth that breaking bread with other people, that sharing food, that sitting round a dining table with people does break down barriers. And now it enables you, from a very human level, just to acknowledge another culture. It enables you to learn about another culture. And it enables you to bring - to humanize another culture. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Let me just ask you if there's one memory or one moment or one day or one cafe or one person's home or kitchen that really just stays seared in your memory as you were doing this research. YASMIN KHAN : There really is. It comes to me so instantly. I remember one evening I was in Ramallah, and I'd just been to visit this Palestinian yoga school and had gone back with the teachers to one of their homes. And we were all sat outside under a full moon. Our host had brought out this beautiful dish called moussaka. And it's roast eggplant cooked in a garlic and allspice and cumin tomato sauce with chickpeas in it. And we kind of tore off pieces of taboon flatbread and scooped up these morsels of eggplant and tomato, sat outside on this beautiful evening, and it's just a memory I'll cherish forever and a real - you know, something that will always remind me of how Palestinians can find joy and celebrate life no matter what circumstances they're in. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Well, the book sounds lovely. And thanks so much for talking to us about it. YASMIN KHAN : Thank you so much for having me on. \n\n ###",

Obviously, 17 is the number of people who died. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Significant number, yeah. JESSICA BAKEMAN, BYLINE : And then there are also going to be some community groups having activities throughout the day. For example, there's a nonprofit called ShineMSD that was founded by some of the students who wrote a song called \"Shine.\" They sang it at the CNN town hall one week after the shooting, on national TV. And so they're going to have art therapists at the park that's near the school, so students can go and do some drumming and do some painting. I know some students are doing a poetry reading - so lots of activities for people, if they want to, to come together and try to heal together. DAVID GREENE, HOST : But a lot of students are being kept home to just spend time with their families, it sounds like. JESSICA BAKEMAN, BYLINE : Yeah, so students are allowed to just not go to school today and tomorrow. They're encouraged, if you don't want to participate in some kind of community service activity, then stay home with your family. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Can I just ask you - it seems like, even a year on, there is still so much anger here, a lot of it being directed at the school superintendent in Broward County, Robert Runcie. I mean, Florida's new governor came out yesterday, said he wants a grand jury to investigate how, you know, school safety is handled throughout the state, but especially here in Broward County. What - why all this anger? JESSICA BAKEMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. So the parents of the victims especially, and also parents of students who still go to Marjory Stoneman Douglas, are really angry that some of the school safety measures they see as critical are not in place yet or weren't in place before the shooting that could have potentially prevented some of the death that happened. So specifically, there's a commission called the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission. It was created by the legislature to investigate the shooting. And some of their recommendations are specifically looking at what would have prevented what happened last year. JESSICA BAKEMAN, BYLINE : So, for example, they want the police officers in Broward to have access to cameras because there was an issue with delayed surveillance footage. They want a code red policy, so that it's clear what happens if there is an active shooter situation. And they also want what we - what are called hard corners. So those are spaces in classrooms where students can hide away from a threat where they wouldn't be able to be seen or shot through a classroom window or door, which is something that happened on February 14 last year. DAVID GREENE, HOST : All right. WLRN's Jessica Bakeman. Thanks so much. JESSICA BAKEMAN, BYLINE : Thanks, David. DAVID GREENE, HOST : And, you know, I had a chance to sit down with the superintendent, Robert Runcie, in Broward County in his office yesterday. And as Jessica just was telling us about those hard corners in classrooms to protect people, I asked the superintendent if they have now, a year on, been marked off in every classroom in the county. ROBERT RUNCIE : Not in every school in the county. Our goal was to try to get this done by the end of February. It may go a little longer than that because we're trying to work with law enforcement agencies, and there's some apprehension on some of them to be engaged in a process of designating that because of maybe liability concerns. So it's not... DAVID GREENE, HOST : Let me just give you the chance to explain why is that not going - like, it seems, I think, to some people, like you're just putting tape down in - so why is that... ROBERT RUNCIE : Oh, no. So here's what the concern is - the corners are not so straightforward. So, for example, if I have a classroom that has two doors, where is the corner? Is it over here, if you come through that door? Or is it over there, if the threat comes through the other door? ROBERT RUNCIE : So this is not something that you want to simplify. It's an important and thoughtful thing that needs to be done in each and every classroom because not every single classroom in this county or in any district anywhere is exactly the same. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Well, can I ask you about something that's been very personal? There have been some of the families of victims who have felt like you didn't reach out to them in ways they had hoped for. We were actually sitting down this week with the brother of Alaina Petty, who was killed. He said that families have been disappointed that you haven't visited with them, families of victims. DAVID GREENE, HOST : I mean, he said to us, he hasn't come - speaking about you - come to visit with his family. That - are we missing something? I mean, or is that a decision that you made? \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In Washington, talks at securing a deal on border security, including the president's wall, fell apart. The acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney spoke to \"Fox News Sunday,\" and here's what he said about the possibility of another shutdown. MICK MULVANEY : They cannot sign everything they put in front of him. There'd be some things that simply we couldn't agree to. So the government shutdown is technically still on the table. We do not want it to come to that, but that option is still open to the president and will remain so. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So where does that leave negotiations right now? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here. Hi there, Tamara. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : I just want to note, Mick Mulvaney did raise the prospect of a shutdown there. But he said it's technically still on the table, which I read to mean virtually not on the table. What, if anything, are lawmakers coming up with? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Well, what we hear is that the negotiations at the moment are stalled. This comes after last week. They were saying they were making good progress, and everybody was optimistic. Now those negotiations have hit a bump. The problem seems to be not just funding for the wall. Democrats are now saying they would fund some portion of the wall, but they want something in exchange for that. And they want to limit funding for ICE detention beds. They object to the way that the Trump administration is doing deportation policy, and they want to sort of control the way that is done by limiting the number of detention beds. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : In past negotiations, back when the government was still shut down, the White House had asked - had actually been asking for more money, about $800 million more for detention beds. So this is a real standoff, and it's a different one. It's about policy more than it is about money or about symbolism. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : But it's also still very emotional and talked about in moral terms. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, let's remember. ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement - there is a movement among some Democrats to abolish ICE. It doesn't sound like that's where Democrats are, but they want to restrict its activities to some degree so you have a broader border security debate. Now, how is the president trying to influence this debate by showing up near the Texas border today? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Well, the president is likely to do what the president has done in other addresses, including the State of the Union and two other addresses to the American people as this debate has gone on, which is to talk about crime and paint all immigrants as criminals - all immigrants coming through the southern border. And so he is likely to do the thing that he has been doing. It's not clear whether it will be persuasive. But San Antonio - not San Antonio... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : El Paso. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : El Paso. El Paso is an area where he says the wall has worked. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, El Paso is also the home city of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman who is thinking about a run for president. And by no means is he the only Democrat who's moving in that direction. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Yeah. And Beto is on something of a vision quest, but other people have really been running for president already. Cory Booker was in South Carolina this weekend. Kirsten Gillibrand was also there. Amy Klobuchar made an announcement on an island in the middle of the Mississippi River in Minnesota in the middle of a snow storm. Elizabeth Warren made it official with a big speech in Massachusetts. It is still frozen and snowy, and the 2020 campaign is up and running. There are five women members of Congress already running for president, and it's not even March. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So much for a political correspondent to do - Tamara, glad you're there. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Tamara Keith. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Ralph Northam is now trying to answer that very question. He refused to resign over an old racist photo and is now giving interviews in an effort to rebuild public support for him. He gave one interview to Gayle King on CBS. RALPH NORTHAM : Virginia needs someone that can heal. There's no better person to do that than a doctor. Virginia also needs someone who is strong, who has empathy, who has courage and who has a moral compass. And that's why I'm not going anywhere. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Northam has denied that he was in the old yearbook photo. He admits he did wear blackface while impersonating Michael Jackson - once. He's defending himself at the same time that the lieutenant governor, rather, faces two accusations of sexual misconduct. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And let's focus on the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax. Whittney Evans of our member station WCVE in Richmond has been covering that part of the story. Good morning. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So how has Fairfax's case advanced over the weekend? WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : Well, first to be clear, Fairfax has strongly denied both of these allegations. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Right. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : He says the encounters in question were consensual. So what's happened since the first allegation is that people are now calling on Fairfax to step down. They weren't after the first allegation. Lots of prominent people in Virginia and across the country are now saying they want to see him resign immediately, and that includes most of Virginia's congressional delegation and even people like Senator Kamala Harris, who's running for president. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : But there are also some people who are saying, slow this down. Let's not rush to judgment. There are some religious groups that have a rally scheduled at the Capitol today to support keeping Fairfax in office. So other than denying the allegations, Fairfax says he's called for an FBI investigation to clear his name. But it's unclear if the FBI would take that up. It's usually local jurisdictions that handle these kinds of cases. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : I did see the video over the weekend of one Virginia lawmaker stepping before reporters and saying, if the lieutenant governor doesn't resign by Monday, I'm going to start impeachment proceedings. Can he do that? WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : Well, there is a difference of opinion about whether impeachment for this situation is even possible in Virginia. A state representative who's a Democrat - his name's Patrick Hope - said he's going to start the impeachment process today. And he plans to introduce a resolution in the House. And then if a majority of the House vote in favor of the resolution, the process begins. But it's ultimately up to the Senate, which will conduct a trial and make the final call. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : But I spent some time this weekend with this man named Dick Howard. He's a constitutional scholar in Virginia, and he was actually part of the group that rewrote the Virginia constitution in 1971. He's the only one left of that group. He was 35 years old when he helped write it, and he's in his early 80s now, and he had this to say. A E DICK HOWARD : The constitution actually says that you have impeachment if there has been malfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty or other high crime or misdemeanor. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : So Delegate Hope, the representative who plans to introduce the articles of impeachment, he says sexual assault obviously is clearly, you know, a high crime. But Howard's interpretation of the constitution is that the high crime or misdemeanor piece has to have taken place while the official was in office, right? To qualify for impeachment, the crime has to be somehow tied to the elected official's position of power. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And of course, these accusations are more than a decade old, well before he became lieutenant governor. So can he continue doing the job - which is a real job, lieutenant governor? I mean, he has to be in public today. Can he continue doing that? WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : Yeah. And there's no reason to believe that he wouldn't. Sources close to him say that he does plan to gavel in today, and it will be business as usual. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Gavel in because he runs the Senate, when you're the lieutenant governor of Virginia. WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : That's right. He runs the Senate, and he is next in line should the office of the governor go vacant. \n\n ###",

WHITTNEY EVANS, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's Whittney Evans of WCVE. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : All right. The confrontation in Venezuela now moves to that country's border. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah, the border between Venezuela and Colombia. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED GROUP : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED GROUP : (Speaking Spanish). RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What you're hearing now is the sound of Venezuelan doctors. Yesterday, they were near this bridge that connects Colombia and Venezuela. And they are demanding that the Venezuelan military stop the blockade that is now keeping U.S. humanitarian aid from getting into the country. And of course, the backdrop to all this is the political crisis in Venezuela between the president, Nicolas Maduro, and the U.S.-backed opposition leader, Juan Guaido. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Which the U.S. has now - who the U.S. has now recognized as the president. John Otis is covering this story from the Colombia-Venezuela border. Hi there, John. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : What is the purpose of the United States in sending this aid? JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Well, you know, on paper, the reason is because there is a big humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. They're sending up, you know, rice and beans and cooking oil and all kinds of, you know, emergency medical kits and baby formula. You know, they want to try to get that aid into Venezuela to start to try to help alleviate all the suffering. But there's also a lot of politics involved. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : One of the reasons for amassing all this aid, you know, right on the border is to try to tempt the Venezuelan military forces or shame the Venezuelan military forces who are propping up Maduro. They want the top officers to turn against his government, to allow this aid to start flowing into the country to alleviate the suffering. And you know, that would be one way to bring about regime change, which is what the Trump administration and the opposition is really pushing. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh - because the United States has effectively said, this is humanitarian aid for the Venezuelan people in the name of the government we recognize, the government of Juan Guaido. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Yes, that's exactly right. They're trying to give a boost to Guaido. Guaido really doesn't control anything in Venezuela. But they want this humanitarian aid to be kind of a symbol of the good things that Guaido would bring to Venezuela if he is actually allowed to rule and if Maduro goes into exile. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : We'll note, John, that you're in a border city there. I imagine you've been down to see the border crossing. What, as far as you can tell from the Colombian side, is the attitude of the Venezuelan military up to now? JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : You know, up to now, Steve, I mean, there've been, you know, just a few defections. And also, the top military attache in Washington has turned against Maduro. But overall, the Venezuelan military is standing firm. They're supporting Maduro. And so the problem here is that - because of that, you know, Maduro's still in power, he still controls the country. And there's really kind of no plan B for getting this aid across the border into Venezuela. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Thanks for the update, John. Really appreciate it. \n\n ###",

They've said that especially during President Trump's trade war with China. Turns out, there is at least one winner, though. Vietnam is gaining business. It's receiving what you might call trade war refugees who are taking their business out of the war zone. NPR's Rob Schmitz went there. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : On the new expressway connecting Hanoi to the ocean, trucks loaded with toys, televisions and telephones have brought traffic to a standstill, their drivers wearily gazing out under rows of cranes building more factories. The only one smiling is Dan Krassenstein, a supply chain manager who's followed one economic boom after another, from Taiwan to China, and now to Vietnam. DAN KRASSENSTEIN : Everything I'm seeing now in South Asia and Southeast Asia, it's like \"Groundhog Day.\" It's like 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. It just keeps repeating itself. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : But this time, a trade war is accelerating the global supply chain shift. President Trump's tariffs on China were part of an effort to bring jobs back to America, but those jobs are heading to countries like Vietnam, instead. DAN KRASSENSTEIN : So today, are you selling any bags to the United States? ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : Krassenstein's company, Procon Pacific, sells heavy-duty plastic bags for transporting goods like sugar, flour and fertilizer on container ships. Today Dan's visiting a company named Anphat. He's going to check out their factory to see if he wants to source his bags here. Sales director Jessica Hien says they're eager to work with him. JESSICA HIEN : And we do welcome any comments about the factory or anything at the production... ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : Did you hear that - we welcome comments? Dan heard that. DAN KRASSENSTEIN : I always walk along the walls because that's where dirt gathers, rodents, insects, et cetera. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : On his factory tour, he's checking for cleanliness. These are food-grade bags, and the factory floor needs to be spotless to prevent contamination. DAN KRASSENSTEIN : Clearly, you can see there's some spider web. So that's an area where something from the outside is coming in. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : It's been tough moving out of China. Suppliers there keep a tidy ship, and a typical worker makes 50 bags a day. Vietnamese workers are half as productive, but they make less than half the wage of a Chinese worker. Krassenstein estimates a savings between 10 percent and 20 percent by making his bags here. A drawback, though, is cleanliness. DAN KRASSENSTEIN : And see right here? This trash can, I found some evidence of candy wrappers. This is also a food-grade violation, with candy wrapper. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : There's a sign at the entrance saying no food or beverages. But then Dan finds a vending machine on the factory floor. There's clearly room for improvement. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : And Vietnam is on a path to do just that. This is the soundtrack to the port city of Haiphong, population 2 million. In the past few years, Haiphong has built an expressway to the capital, Hanoi, one to China, an airport and a deep-water port. Cranes building five-star hotels fill the sky. Last year, its economy grew by 17 percent, more than any other city in Vietnam. If there's a clear winner of the U.S.-China trade war, its Haiphong. Hans Kerstens works for Deep C, a Belgian company developing the city's port. He says, the companies that are leaving China, this is where the rebuilding. HANS KERSTENS : Most of the time, we see a decision time between one and two years. Last year, a lot of the companies that we signed, the decision time was much shorter. We had one company coming in in the evening, signing-in in the morning. It was a Chinese company. We had never seen that before. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : And it's not only the trade war drying supply chains from China. The electricity price in Vietnam is half that of China's, and if companies relocate to Haiphong, they pay a fraction of the taxes. Government incentives mean the average tax over a company's first two decades is around 4 percent. The port city's location is also important, says Deeps C's general director Bruno Jaspaert. BRUNO JASPAERT : I think Haiphong is strategically and geopolitically very well-located. The South China Sea is heavily contested, and the border line where you don't have issues is about here. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : That wasn't always the case. Haiphong's port, which empties into the Gulf of Tonkin, was heavily bombed in the Vietnam War. Jaspaert says when they were building the deep-water port, they had to blow up portions of the seabed to detonate unexploded bombs buried in the sand. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : The flood of expats into Haiphong can be best seen and heard at the city's only international school. Principal John Mudd, a native of Montana, went from managing 50 students to 140 in a single year. And now the new school he opened in the fall to accommodate all these new students will have to expand. \n\n ###",

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Am I happy at first glance? I've just got to see it. The answer is, no, I'm not. I'm not happy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That was the president speaking there to reporters just as details were getting out about a bipartisan border security deal. This legislation includes some spending for border fencing, but it falls billions of dollars short of the money that President Trump had demanded for a border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging the president to support this bill. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : When last we spoke of the border deal, the public had not yet seen the bill. So what does this agreement really do for border security? Let's ask NPR's Scott Horsley, who's on the line. Scott, good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Let's begin with one thing we do know for sure. Nita Lowey, one of the negotiators, affirmed it last night on All Things Considered. NITA LOWEY : Frankly, it denies the president billions of dollars in funding for the concrete wall that he demanded. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. The billions are missing. So if the bill doesn't have that, Scott Horsley, is there anything for the president to hold onto and claim that his side won? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Well, there are a few bones for the president, to be sure. We still haven't seen the actual bill, so we will get more information as this day goes on. But we do know, as you mentioned, it includes only about a quarter of the wall funding that the president had demanded, only enough to build about 55 miles of advanced fencing. It also does not include the increased funding for detention bed that the president had sought to house people who are awaiting deportation. In fact, the authorized number of beds in this agreement is down from the number that Homeland Security is housing right now. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : However, we don't believe it includes the sharp reduction in beds for people who are arrested in the interior of the United States that some on the Democratic side had been seeking. So I guess you could call that a win for the president. And also, there is some additional money for enhanced border security that doesn't involve a wall. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, let's get to the practical effect here on the border, setting aside the politics for the moment. Is it becoming clear how this measure, this package of measures, would make the border more secure? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Well, certainly a lot of this discussion has been largely symbolic. Whether we're talking about 55 miles of wall or 200-plus miles that the president had been seeking, it's all a fraction of the 2,000-mile border. This does include additional money to beef up the official ports of entry. And it's important remember, Steve, that there is a huge amount of legitimate cross-border traffic that sometimes gets lost as we talk about illicit traffic. That's enormously important in places like El Paso, like McAllen, like San Diego. There is also, however, non-human traffic. And a lot of the fencing that is in this bill is in the Rio Grande Valley, an environmentally sensitive area, and that could be affected adversely by the wall that is included. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. All right, Scott, thanks for the update, really appreciate it. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : You're very welcome. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Scott Horsley. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Many of the stories in the news today touch on U.S. relations with Latin America. That is certainly true of the American jury that convicted the Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah. That verdict was handed down in a federal courthouse in Brooklyn on Tuesday. U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue spoke outside the courthouse after the verdict was read. RICHARD DONOGHUE : This conviction, we expect, will bring a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. It is a sentence from which there is no escape and no return. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The jury's decision came after weeks of gripping, at times even disturbing, testimony. A number of former cartel members actually took the stand and then detailed the brutality and bloodshed that was at the core of El Chapo's cartel, a cartel which was responsible for a lot of the flow of narcotics into the U.S. for decades. So the question now, how is this conviction being viewed back in Mexico? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, NPR's Carrie Kahn is going to tell us because she is in Mexico City. Hi, Carrie. \n\n ###",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Is this a big subject of conversation where you are? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE : Well, it's been covered in the press here - definitely isn't dominating the news, but you know, some of the trial's more salacious revelations got some good media play. Remember the day in the trial when this convicted Colombian trafficker testified for the prosecution that Guzman had paid the former president a $100-million bribe? Yeah, that barely got coverage here. I think part of it was that Mexicans were in the midst of a crippling gas crisis. But also I think there's a lot of corruption fatigue since, you know, these past years have been plagued by revelation after revelation of high-level corruption and conflict-of-interest scandals by the previous administration. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE : But yesterday, we went out after the verdict, and we did get reaction from Mexicans here in the capital. And by far, most were pleased with Guzman's conviction. One high school student said, you know, maybe in some parts of the country, Guzman is still seen as - romanticized for his outlaw persona, but for him, he was a brutal criminal who caused this country so much pain. And this one 30-year-old computer salesman really summed up what a lot of different people said, is that how Mexico could and should have been the one to try Guzman. And they just felt bad that it's unfortunate that a foreign government had to bring this man to justice once and for all. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Carrie, I'm curious. When you talk about the relatively muted coverage in the media, I have heard over the years, perhaps you have as well, of Mexican journalists who are threatened, who are killed, editors who are told not to put certain things in the paper. Is this something that, if you're in the Mexican media, you have to be a little bit careful about what you say, even though obviously Guzman is in federal custody now? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE : Definitely. Definitely. There is a lot of self-censorship here by the press and - but there are also a lot of courageous and brave journalists that try and cover this drug war and the cartels as best as they can. But it is - you know, Mexico has one of the highest rates of journalists being murdered in the world. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Do you have a sense as to whether Guzman's conviction will significantly affect the actual flow of drugs into, through, out of Mexico into the United States? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE : Well, just looking at Guzman's cartel specifically, the Sinaloa cartel, it hasn't lost much strength since his arrest in 2016 or his extradition in 2017. It's still one of the largest in the world, and that's according to the U.S. and the DEA's - the Drug Enforcement Administration's - last year, their drug threat assessment. They said in it that the cartel maintains the most expansive international footprint of any Mexican drug organization still. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wow. OK, Carrie, thanks for the update, really appreciate it. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE : You're welcome. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Carrie Kahn in Mexico City. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Thousands of migrant children continue to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border every month without their parents. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. And then many of these kids are then transferred to an emergency intake shelter in South Florida. It's called Homestead, and it's been the focus of a lot of controversy. It is the largest shelter for migrant children in the U.S., and it's the only one run by a for-profit corporation, and there's no oversight from state regulators. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's John Burnett toured the shelter. He's with us this morning. Hi, John. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE : Hey, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So what did you see when you got in there? JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE : Well, really it's - you know, the tour guide tried to make it seem like it was a summer camp to us. This was actually my third tour of a large government child shelter, and there was certain similarities among all of them. They show you the soccer fields and the basketball courts and classrooms and the Xbox games and the cafeteria where they get three hot meals and two snacks a day. And they tell us about the holiday parties and the talent shows. And then you see the kids, these lines of 12 Central American teenagers at a time, they're all walking very orderly, single file, escorted by a youth worker. They smile and say hola. But the thing is, you never really get to talk to the children or record anything. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So that leaves you going for other sources of information, as well you should. Are there people who have spoken with the children that can give you information? JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE : Right. And this was really interesting. I had the good fortune to get a fuller picture of the lives of these migrant kids in the Homestead shelter. I sat down with a group of attorneys who'd been granted access to the children by a federal judge. They oversee the welfare of migrant kids in U.S. custody. And I asked them, OK, so this is what reporters see on our sort of stage-managed tours. What do you, the lawyers, see? This is Leecia Welch. She's director of legal advocacy at the National Center for Youth Law. LEECIA WELCH : We see a very different picture. We see extremely traumatized children, some of whom sit across from us and can't stop crying over what they're experiencing. \n\n ###",

It's the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., and it's now in the middle of a sex abuse crisis. This week, the Houston Chronicle published a comprehensive investigation that counts more than 700 victims of abuse by church leaders over the last two decades. ROBERT DOWNEN : There was a huge diversity, both in the abuse type, the age of victims. But virtually all of the victims were children. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's Robert Downen, one of the reporters on that investigation. While there have been high-profile and individual sex abuse allegations against Southern Baptist leaders in the past, the Houston Chronicle report lays out just how widespread the abuse has been. ROBERT DOWNEN : What knowledge exactly leaders had, I don't know. But I think that it's pretty fair to say that this stuff was out there. And there was a group of vocal people who were basically yelling as loud as they could that this was a crisis. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : To find out how church leaders are responding to the results of this investigation, I spoke with Russell Moore. He heads the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. RUSSELL MOORE : It's shocking and scandalous, and it's a real crisis. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So how could this kind of abuse go on for so many years in so many different congregations? RUSSELL MOORE : Well, there are a number of reasons and none of them good - and none of them excusable. One of the things that's happened is that a church, which is supposed to be and should be the safest place in the world for vulnerable people, has often been a place where predators believe that they can hide. And unfortunately, too many churches have either had the understanding that these sorts of things couldn't happen to them because they're churches and haven't been vigilant. And churches that have taken a wrongheaded and unbiblical view of grace to believe that somehow that means an excusing of predatory behavior or of not seeing the role of the civil authorities in reporting right away. There are so many horrific reasons behind this happening. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you're suggesting that internally, each church - which has a lot of autonomy - even if they were aware of the allegations, they may have put religious doctrine and religious notions of forgiveness over accountability. RUSSELL MOORE : Well, I think in many cases, there was an understanding of forgiveness and grace and reconciliation that doesn't match up with what the Bible teaches. Jesus never, in any place, excuses the harming of vulnerable people and children and others. And so this is a human crisis, and it's also a theological crisis. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The Houston Chronicle, as part of the report, says church officials did know, were encouraged to make reforms and were not interested in doing so. Do you know why? RUSSELL MOORE : Often, church autonomy has been used as an excuse for a lack of accountability. Our polity does make this harder because each church is independent, and a church doesn't answer to a bishop or anyone above us. But that doesn't mean that there aren't things that can and should and must be done. And so that means that the hard work has to be done to see how that can happen, not to use church autonomy as an excuse. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what are some practical steps that churches and the broader Southern Baptist Convention can take in this moment? It's one thing to say, this is a sin; this is an outrage. How do you make sure it doesn't happen again? RUSSELL MOORE : Well, there are a number of steps. One of those has to do with training churches to know how to respond when there is a case or a suspicion of a case. That has to do with also training ministers at the very front end of their ministries, and we're working with seminaries and universities to do that. And then there has to be a way to connect churches to one another to know when there has been an incident or an allegation of abuse happening at another church to prevent someone from simply moving from one church to the other under cover of darkness. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The Houston Chronicle says in its report that at least one accused sex abuse offender remains to this day in his church position. Do you think that should be the case? RUSSELL MOORE : Absolutely not. I think that in every case, someone who is a sex offender should not only be removed from any ministry leadership and disciplined by a local congregation but should also be handed over to the civil authorities. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Does that mean you will follow up on the Houston Chronicle's reporting and try to pass that message down to the local church? RUSSELL MOORE : Yes. If I have any inkling as to who this is, I'll call the congregation directly. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you see parallels to what's happening within the Southern Baptist Convention and the sex abuse crisis in the Catholic Church? RUSSELL MOORE : Yes, I do because both are a crisis of credibility. Someone should know that when they step into a church, that they're in a place that is going to be safe and a place that is going to be advocating the most strongly for those who are the most vulnerable. And so there very much is a parallel there. What I hope is that what happens out of that is genuine reform that will ensure that the next generation of people don't have to face these questions at all. \n\n ###",

BRADLEY COOPER : (As Phil) Who was that guy? He was so mean. DAVID GREENE, HOST : That guy is Ken Jeong, real-life medical doctor turned actor.

I had quit my day job. I did feel free, like, OK, I can really kind of pursue acting full time and with the support of my wife. And then my wife gets pregnant with twins, and we have, you know, two beautiful girls, Alexa and Zooey. And then my wife, she - yeah - found a lump while she was breastfeeding. It came back stage-three triple-negative breast cancer. And... DAVID GREENE, HOST : Which is very serious. KEN JEONG : Very serious, a very aggressive variant of breast cancer. And, you know, everything in our tracks stopped. And, you know, I credit my wife with being so strong. And I remember right before she started her chemo. And she just said, I would not - you know, we have two beautiful girls. I wouldn't trade it for the world. The way - I still remember how she just had a calmness about her that was a calm strength that I don't see in a lot of people. DAVID GREENE, HOST : She's undergoing chemo when you get offered maybe the biggest role of your careers, Leslie Chow in \"The Hangover.\" Is that... KEN JEONG : Yep. Yep. DAVID GREENE, HOST : What are you both talking about when...? KEN JEONG : It was my wife and even my mother-in-law telling me to take the role, like, because you're suffering from caregiver burnout. You're - because our twins are 1 year old at the time, and I'm taking - lighting the candle on both ends. And I was doing everything I could, you know? Or - with the kids or driving Tran to chemo or making sure she was OK after she would get weak from the chemo. So... DAVID GREENE, HOST : They wanted you to have an outlet. KEN JEONG : They wanted me to have an outlet. Tran did say, it was like this will - this is a good outlet. DAVID GREENE, HOST : We should say it's so great that she is a survivor and is... KEN JEONG : Yes, and - yes, and... DAVID GREENE, HOST : ...Doing so well and was at your show. And, I mean... KEN JEONG : Of note, she's cancer free... DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah.

I just wondered if I had anything to say. And it takes - really, if you get really perfectionistic about, which I am, it can take 10 years to really write 10 good minutes.

Whether he will answer their more sensitive questions about the special counsel's Russia investigation is another matter. House Democrats have threatened to subpoena him if he didn't show up. NPR's Kelsey Snell is here in the studio this morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Hi, Kelsey. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : Hi there. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what do we know about the line of questioning that the judiciary committee is going to pose to Whitaker? KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : Well, we know that they have a lot of questions. And the primary thing that we'll probably hear them ask about is the Russia investigation. But I understand Democrats also want to ask things about immigration policy and the way the administration plans to handle these cases, not defending the Affordable Care Act in federal court. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : But, again, this is going to be a lot about Russia. They want to ask him specifically about the circumstances around President Trump's firing of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and whether that replacement was intended to interfere into the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. And I would imagine that you will hear that over and over and over again. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This hearing with Whitaker comes at the end of a week where Democrats started to follow through on campaign promises that they had made to investigate Trump and the Trump administration. One of those promises was to look into the president's tax returns. Is that going to be part of this oversight push? KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : Yeah, it is. And they started to, actually, begin the process of looking into the taxes in a hearing yesterday. But it's starting out really slow. And we kind of expect that it'll continue at that pace, in part, because there are concerns that going too far too fast could be politically perilous, essentially. Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged a careful approach in a press conference yesterday. And the hearing that they did yesterday was kind of - I don't know - academic. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : They had a lot of think tank people talking about the law around the president's tax returns because it is a pretty serious thing to go after somebody's private tax information and put it out there publicly. The committee overseeing this, the Ways and Means Committee, has that legal authority. But they want to use that judiciously. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : I think, though, that this whole question is part of a broader theme in the House right now, where Democrats are starting to flex their muscles and show what it will really be like to have Democrats in charge of the House and in opposition, in many ways, to this president. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : They also have to manage this balancing act, right? Like, on the one hand, they want to move forward with aggressive investigations into the administration. But they also have other policy priorities, I imagine, they want to push through. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : Yeah. They talk about lowering prescription drug prices. And they talk about doing something on infrastructure and doing something on climate change. But, really, it's hard to do that for Democrats because they really only control the House of Representatives. They can't get things passed in the Senate. And they don't control the White House. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : So when it comes down to it, investigations are a way for them to put their stamp on a lot of issues that they care about. They held hearings on guns. We expect them to do more on the environment. They are going to talk about child separation policy at the border. It is their way to interact with the White House and kind of hold the president accountable for policies of the last two years. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So meanwhile - and that's a big meanwhile... KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : (Laughter). RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There's a group of bipartisan lawmakers who have been tasked with trying to find a solution to the whole border wall debate in order to prevent yet another government shutdown. Can you get us up to speed on where those negotiations are right now? KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : Yeah, they - that group of - they call themselves conferees. They have been talking for over a week now. And they say that things are going well. One of the top negotiators, Richard Shelby of Alabama, met with President Trump yesterday, came back and said he thought things were going well and that he was feeling positive. But they only have a week. Their deadline is a week from today - February 15. And that doesn't give them a lot of time. KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE : So I've heard from many people that they think it may - they might need a short extension if they're going to hash out a deal in time to keep the government open. I am told, however, nobody wants a shutdown. And so (laughter) they're doing everything they can to avoid another situation like we saw.

DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. Bezos laid out this explosive allegation in a post on the blog site Medium last night. In it, Bezos says the tabloid's owner, David Pecker, was trying to blackmail him. In the post, he writes, quote, \"rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\" DAVID GREENE, HOST : Now, Bezos says the company was threatening to release intimate photos of him in an effort to stop him from finding out how the National Enquirer had obtained his private photos and text messages documenting an extramarital affair. Bezos also implies here that the reason for the blackmail is that he is the owner of the Washington Post, which has been dogged in its reporting about President Trump. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So much to talk about here. NPR's Uri Berliner is here to help us understand this story. Hi, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE : Hey, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So David mentioned there some intimate photos revealing an extramarital affair. Can you tell us more about what exactly the National Enquirer had on Bezos? URI BERLINER, BYLINE : Yeah. They said they had a series of photographs of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, the woman that he had been having an affair with, very sexually suggestive, lewd photographs that they were threatening to publish unless Bezos backed off from his investigation into how AMI, the parent company of the National Enquirer, obtained those photographs. And that's - he really wanted to find out how those personal texts and photos leaked. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. So in this long Medium post, Bezos just publishes some of the emails that he says are from AMI. What do they say? URI BERLINER, BYLINE : Yeah. So Bezos, you know, basically says, OK, you've got these photos on me. I've got these emails from you, from officials from AMI. And basically, they're saying that they want Bezos to stop investigating. One of them from an AMI official proposes some terms to end the dispute with Bezos. It says it will agree not to publish any of the texts or photos. But in exchange, Bezos must say that AMI's coverage of his affair was not politically motivated. The other email described some of those suggestive photos that we've been talking about. URI BERLINER, BYLINE : I reached out to AMI for comment. I've not heard back from them. But Bezos in his post says there is a political motivation here. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I mean, let's just spend a second talking about that. There are all kinds of political threads to this, right? As we noted, like, David Pecker is a good friend of Donald Trump's. And Jeff Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post, a paper that has been pretty critical and aggressive in the reporting over Donald Trump, right? URI BERLINER, BYLINE : Absolutely. The Post has been very aggressive in its reporting of Trump. Trump has also feuded with Amazon, the company that Jeff Bezos founded. He claims they get all kinds of breaks. They're not paying their fair share of taxes. So this has been an ongoing feud between between President Trump and Bezos, who owns the Post and founded Amazon. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And remind us about the National Enquirer's connection to the investigations into Donald Trump because David Pecker was granted immunity in the investigation into Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen because Pecker was involved into those illicit payments to Karen McDougal, right? URI BERLINER, BYLINE : Right. The National Enquirer acknowledged paying hush money to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump. She was paid 150,000 during the 2016 campaign. And so that's really what happened there. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : He also refers to his ownership of the Post as being a complexifier for him, which is an odd word. But, I mean, what more does he say about his role as the owner of the Post? URI BERLINER, BYLINE : He says, (laughter) yeah, it's a complexifier, difficult, but he has no regrets about owning the Post. And it's - he says it's - when he looks back on his life, owning the Post and supporting its mission is something he'll remain proud of at age 90. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK. NPR's Uri Berliner for us. Thanks, Uri. URI BERLINER, BYLINE : You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the state of Louisiana from implementing a restrictive new abortion law before then ruling on its constitutionality. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yes.

Amy, thanks for being here. AMY HOWE : Hey, good morning. Thanks for having me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : First, before we talk about the implications, what exactly would this law do in Louisiana? AMY HOWE : A lot of it depends on exactly how it plays out. And that is part of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's dissent, which we can talk about. But the opponents of the law say that if the law's allowed to go into effect, there'd only be one doctor to provide abortions in the early stages of pregnancy and none at all for women seeking abortions after 17 weeks of pregnancy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You mentioned Justice Kavanaugh's dissent. What did he say? AMY HOWE : So he was the only one who wrote to explain why he would have denied the stay that the opponents of the law were seeking. He would have allowed the law to go into effect. There were four justices altogether - Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch in addition to Kavanaugh all said they would deny the stay and allow the law to go into effect. AMY HOWE : But what Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court's newest justice, wrote is that a central legal question in the case is whether this requirement that doctors who perform abortions in Louisiana have to have admitting privileges will impose an undue burden, which is the legal standard for whether a law violates the Constitution, on a woman's right to have an abortion depends on a factual question, whether the doctors in this case can actually get admitting privileges. AMY HOWE : And that's disputed. The District Court in this case, the trial court, said that they wouldn't be able to, and the Court of Appeals said that they would be able to. And so what Justice Kavanaugh said is instead of putting the law on hold and speculating about this, let's figure it out during the 45-day transition period because if the doctors can get admitting privileges, there's no undue burden, and the law should be allowed to stand. If they can't, he said, they can come back to court. AMY HOWE : And this would be faster than doing it the way the court's going to do it, which ultimately probably will wind up with a decision sometime in the summer of 2020. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Interesting. AMY HOWE : Yeah. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Let me ask you about how it broke, though - 5 to 4. John Roberts, the chief justice, sided with the liberals. Was that surprising? AMY HOWE : It was, yes. To be sure, the court was not writing on a blank slate because in 2016, the Supreme Court had struck down a similar law from Texas. But in that case, it was Justice Anthony Kennedy who joined the court's former liberal justices, and the chief justice, John Roberts, was actually in dissent. We don't know what his reasoning was to vote this - to vote with the four more liberal justices last night. But we do know that he's an institutionalist. So even if he might believe that the law is constitutional in a vacuum, perhaps this Texas case from three years ago says otherwise. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Amy Howe reports on the Supreme Court for the SCOTUSblog. Amy, thanks for being here this morning. We appreciate it. AMY HOWE : Thanks for inviting me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The will-he-or-won't-he debate is over. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker goes before the House Judiciary Committee today. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. House Democrats have been eager to press Whitaker on his interactions with President Trump and his oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, even threatening to subpoena him if he didn't show up.

And they reiterated a call for Governor Ralph Northam to resign over his blackface controversy. Herring and Northam have said they were unaware of the harm they were doing at the time. I asked Gene Demby of NPR's Code Switch team about the history of blackface in America and why it has endured. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : It is a very long, complicated history. Blackface predates the Civil War, but it really gained traction as part of the minstrel shows that became wildly popular in the latter part of the 19th century. At one point, it was the most popular form of entertainment in the United States. Usually white performers, but not always, would apply some cork or some dye to their skins to blacken their skin. Maybe they'd apply some bright-red lipstick or wear white gloves to perform as these grotesques of what they imagined these newly emancipated black people to be. And it was meant to dehumanize. Blackface corresponds with the rise of Jim Crow segregation and with spectacle lynchings. And the popularity of blackface, like, continued well into the 20th century. By the 1920s, the vaudeville legend Al Jolson was the country's most popular entertainer. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Most of his act was in blackface. He was the star of the first talky, which he performed in blackface. And the conventions of vaudeville are so steeped in blackface imagery that you get Mickey Mouse in white gloves. Like, Mickey Mouse is... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Mickey Mouse. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Mickey Mouse (laughter). RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Mickey Mouse is an outgrowth of blackface? GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Mickey Mouse - according to some researchers of that period, Mickey Mouse is a minstrel figure. And so that's why you see this sort of convention around cartoon characters in white gloves because that's part of vaudeville. And so much of the DNA of vaudeville is blackface. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK, so this is offensive. I mean, when African-Americans - when anyone who understands the history sees this, you understand that this is offensive. And yet, it happens. And yet, white people are still putting blackface on, I mean, in these recent examples. This was happening as recently as the '80s. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Right. I mean, one of the things we talk about a lot on the Code Switch podcast is the way that the civil rights movement created these taboos around open racism. So in the post-civil rights world, blackface moves away from public spaces and sort of retreats to all-white spaces - spaces where there's not going to be a lot of social sanction for it. So... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Where no one raises an eyebrow. They're just... GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Where there's just not going to be any black people around, right? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : And just to back up a bit, that's a lot of spaces that white people inhabit. So a study by the Public Religion Research Institute in 2012 found that white people were significantly less likely to have friends of another race than were black or Latino people. In fact, three quarters of white people, the study found, had entirely white social networks. So the median white person's contact with black people is almost one of abstraction. And so these are spaces that are not really hard to cultivate - these super white spaces. And so when we're looking at these stories in the news, we're seeing fraternities at some college parties. These are spaces that are not necessarily codified as white spaces or resistant to people of color, but they're spaces that are functionally so. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. So that means in these all-white spaces, people - they're basically not held accountable. There's no one there to raise their hand and say, hi, that is super offensive to me. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Right. That's what seems to be happening. And of course there is this continuum, right? Some people are just oblivious. And some people are much more malicious, right? Obviously, we live in a time when someone posts something to social media, there's the slippage between these all-white contexts. And this larger social media space, on Twitter in particular, is much browner and younger than the country at large. And so these very different histories with these imageries are sort of butting up against each other. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So social media makes it easier to hold people accountable for racist behavior. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Yes. It also makes it easier for these images to spread in the world, right? I mean, the picture that seems to have ensnared Ralph Northam was buried in a medical school yearbook. Of course, now someone posts a racist picture to Snapchat or Twitter or Instagram, that can slip out of the sort of safe space into a much more contentious space very quickly. One of the things that is also happening here is that blackface has always had - especially in the post-civil rights world in which it was dangerous, right? That danger is part of the reason why people did it, right? It's part of the reason that people did it in these safe spaces. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Oh, so they knew there was something wrong about it. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE : Right. It's part of the sort of like - the thrill, I imagine. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For the ladies who think it's hard to find a black man who loves black women, Finesse Mitchell says he's just what you're looking for. In fact, the comedian and Essence magazine columnist cares so much, he's written a new book to help a sister out. Yes, he is taken. But his book is called \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much.\" In it, Finesse advises black women on figuring out their male counterparts. He also gives his tips on mastering the dating game. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Like he says, if you want to know whether or not to buy that pair of skinny jeans, go ahead and ask your girlfriend. But when it comes to men, ask Finesse. So we took him up on his offer and invited Finesse to come by. He's right here. Hey, how are you doing? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : Hey, Farai, how are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I am doing great. So, you know, you have all sorts of jokes as a comedian about women and men. But this book has a little tinge of seriousness to it, doesn't it? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : Right. Just some real-life, in-the-trenches type of information that unless you've done it or, you know, had a best friend really go through it and you were a witness to it, then you would just say, oh, that's not true. But everybody who's been - had their heart broken and everybody who's had some great successes, they read the book and if they're smiling, they're laughing. If they're not laughing, they're just chuckling out loud. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What made you want to even break down the situation between men and women? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : I really enjoy it. I'm writing because I've always wanted to write more seriously than just write jokes. With \"SNL,\" you're writing - always writing one particular type of humor. And so when Essence came to me with the opportunity to give women relationship advice, instead of just month after month questions after questions that I thought was so commonsense sometimes, it was so plain, but sometimes, people get a little clouded when it comes to love, I decided to, yeah, let me put everything in a one-stop shop for women. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, you know what, you have this whole thing of the list. What do you mean by the list? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : Everybody knows that in order to have some success in giving anything close to what you want, you got to have an idea what you want. So if you're not actually writing it down, because I know a lot of women who used to write stuff down on paper and then scratch it out three months later when they found out that they don't really want that, to women who just keep an idea of what they want in their heads. I think that it's important to know your type. And if you know your type, you know a good friend from a good love interest. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah, the hilarious sequence in the book where you talk about if men have little flashcards on their forehead, things you can't see but maybe you should. Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : You like that? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I love that. Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : They are figuring guys out. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Mm-hmm. Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : And if everything was on their forehead, the whole game of just, you know, is this guy serious. Is this guy telling me truth? Is this guy genuine? Or am I genuine, do I like, you know what I mean? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Does this guy have 12 kids by 12 women? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : There you go. And I broke them all down, right? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You did. You did. Now, we - let's go back to this question of the list. Tarsha(ph) in St. Louis asks when is a list too long and how detailed should it be. Right now, her list is 47 items long and includes things like he needs to sleep on the left side of the bed and he must love sushi. Has Tarsha taken it too far? Mr. FINESSE MITCHELL (Columnist, Essence Magazine; Author, \"Your Girlfriends Only Know So Much\") : A little bit. Just a little bit. That whole sushi thing is unacceptable. No\u2026 \n\n ###",

One, of course, was suspense to see who would win. And now we know the country singer Kacey Musgraves won album of the year. Childish Gambino became the first hip-hop artist to win record and song of the year. The other kind of suspense was to see who would show up. NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : \"This Is America\" earned Donald Glover, a.k.a. Childish Gambino, three Grammys in addition to song of the year. JOHN MAYER : Childish Gambino could not be here tonight, but we accept this award in his honor. ALICIA KEYS : Childish. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : Singers John Mayer and Alicia Keys accepted the award, but Glover actually declined to attend the ceremony. And one of the artists featured on \"This Is America,\" 21 Savage, couldn't be there because the British-born rapper is fighting deportation from the U.S. Winners Kendrick Lamar and Ariana Grande also declined to attend, and Drake was reported to be a no-show as well. So it was a real surprise when he walked on stage to accept his award for best rap song, \"God's Plan.\" DRAKE : I definitely did not think I was winning anything. My brother's here. I want to take this opportunity while I'm up here to just talk to all the kids that are watching this that are aspiring to do music. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : Drake began by talking about being a mixed-race kid from Canada misunderstood by the music business. And as he held up his trophy, he said this. DRAKE : Look, if there's people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain, in the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don't need this right here. I promise you. You already won. DRAKE : But... UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER : Next, a special Grammy performance by... MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : Drake was cut off before he finished. Later, a spokesperson from the show told reporters backstage that producers thought Drake was finished talking and offered him a chance to finish, but he declined. Another winner, Dua Lipa, was similarly cut off. She won for best new artist and started her speech this way. DUA LIPA : I guess where I want to begin is by saying how honored I am to be nominated alongside so many incredible female artists this year because I guess this year we've really stepped up. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : Her jab referred to a comment Recording Academy president Neil Portnow made after last year's Grammy Awards. He said women should, quote, \"step up,\" unquote, if they wanted to be more visible in the music industry. As Portnow announced, this is his final year at the academy. He addressed that controversial remark by saying the Grammys and the industry must include more female voices. NEIL PORTNOW : This past year I've been reminded that if coming face to face with an issue opens your eyes wide enough, it makes you more committed than ever to help address those issues. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : So host Alicia Keys started out the evening by inviting on stage four other powerful women to talk about what music means to them. ALICIA KEYS : Please, can I bring some of my sisters out here tonight? MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : They were singers Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez, actress Jada Pinkett Smith and former first lady Michelle Obama. MICHELLE OBAMA : From the Motown Records I wore out on the South Side to the \"Who Run The World\" songs that fueled me through this last decade, music has always helped me tell my story. MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE : Alicia Keys reiterated the reference to superstar Beyonce's female empowerment cry. ALICIA KEYS : Who runs the world? \n\n ###",

TONY COX, host : The performance was free to the public. And in classic New Orleans' fashion, theatergoers were treated to bowls of gumbo before the curtain rose. Then a marching band led the crowd two blocks away to a vacant lot where the play was staged. TONY COX, host : Unidentified Man #1: Help. TONY COX, host : Unidentified Man #2: Oh, my God. Help me. We were beginning to weaken. In an hour, sure to see the evening out. TONY COX, host : Unidentified Man #1: Help. Do you hear him? TONY COX, host : Unidentified Man #2: Oh, believe me. We have struggled unassisted. Oh, we are no longer alone waiting for the night, waiting for Godot, waiting for waiting.

Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : Thank you, Tony. TONY COX, host : Hey, listen since the 1950's \"Waiting for Godot\" has been performed all over the world including in prisons and in war zones - all kinds of places. Why does this particular work speak so well to the issues that New Orleans is dealing with right now? Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : Well, This play deals with the abandonment of humanity and struggling with despair, a tug of war between despair and hope. And the whole idea of waiting for an entity to come in and either save you or assist you or do you decide to do something for yourself and understand that there is this abstract idea of hope that you must hang to and try to achieve some semblance of existence and validity to your journey on the - in life. TONY COX, host : Well, what about\u2026 Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : And so right\u2026 TONY COX, host : Go ahead. I'm sorry. Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : So right now in New Orleans, I mean, you know, this for two years been this great sense of abandonment and struggle and a sense of survival and hanging on to hope. And I just think that with all those themes in a play, it just speaks to what people are going through right here and the whole idea of waiting is paramount here in New Orleans. Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : We have been waiting for recovery and waiting for the government to actually live up to his promises and also waiting for a something to inspire and then also dig in deep down with ourselves. The play also says let us do something while we have the chance. TONY COX, host : Let's talk for moment about the staging and the time that we have time left. And we don't have as much time as I wished we did because it's a very interesting story, and I'm a big fan of yours on top of all that. Mr. WENDELL PIERCE (Actor, \"Waiting for Godot;\" \"The Wire\", HBO Channel) : Oh, thank you.

Linda trains prospective foster and adoptive parents on how best to blend newcomers into an existing family structure. TONY COX, host : Linda, welcome. Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : Good morning. TONY COX, host : What would you say is the number one challenge for parents who find themselves presiding over a blended family? Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : The number one challenge for most of them is not realizing that the children are coming, you know, with - we called it baggage, you, know, what the child is bringing, and what that child is bringing is the experiences and peoples and connections and cultures. Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : And so they think, I just want a child so bad and I want to love this child. They forget about what all that child is bringing with them when they come in in the door. And so, therefore, they hit them in a face later in some behaviors. TONY COX, host : Well, let's talk a little bit more about that, as a matter of fact, because when a parent already has biological kids and then they bring in a child from the foster care system, or maybe it's another relative's child, or a spouse's child from a previous marriage or relationship, what kinds of tensions should the parents expect? Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : First of all, the parents need to make sure they know their existing family, their family system as it exists prior to that child arriving. It's best that everyone be on the same page as possible before that new child is added into the family. Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : And you'll be surprised. You think you know your children and you've birth - you've given birth to them, you've raised them, but, you know, you'll find some interesting things out when you talk about bringing in others. That's the first thing. So once everybody's on board for this blend, then you need to have family rules and dialogue on what everybody's role is going to be once that child is there. TONY COX, host : How important is timing in terms of bringing new faces into the household? Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : Timing is very important. I understand there's an emergency situation sometimes, we can't always plan at every aspect of it. But if we know that this is going to happen, timing is very important. We need to transition everyone, the existing family as well as the new child, into that home. And it could start out with being something differently - actually, a lot, such as visits and overnights. TONY COX, host : Are there some family situations, Linda, in terms of kids that should just be avoided, plain and simple? Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : Well, everyone isn't that cut out to parent; we need to face that. And that's why we ask people to please be in touch with their motivation. Put the child first, you know, past your own personal desires and so forth. Put the child first that's going to come into that home. Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : I teach prospective foster and adoptive parents and I tell them, know your family, know yourself. And we work really hard on getting them to look inside of themselves about maybe loss in support that they've had in their life, then, maybe they haven't dealt with it yet. And that needs to happen prior to a child coming in. TONY COX, host : As we bring our conversation to a close, tell us a little bit more about the training. What specifically is the regiment like? I understand it's 33 hours\u2026 Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : Thirty-three hours, yes. It's broken up in 10 modules. And the Los Angeles County insists on anyone interested in their children, whether foster or adopt, they must go through this training with certified trainers. And that goes to every aspect before the child arrives - what to do once the child's in your home, and so forth. And it helps them to have - that way they blend this child into their family without as much difficulty. We want it to be a happy experience for them as well as the child, you know - not to come into chaos. TONY COX, host : Can you tell right away when a parent comes into one of your classes that, oh, they'll be fit or they won't be fit? Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : Almost. Almost we can. And fortunately, for us, they usually weed themselves out because it is a very strict regiment and they cannot be absent for any reason. They must maintain working with us for six weeks. So with that said - and then way we put them through a very intense training, we make them really get in touch with their own feelings which they don't expect. They expect to come in there and get maybe a few parenting courses, and they don't think they're going to have to deal with themselves first. TONY COX, host : Really? Our time is really up, but I have this one quick question. I don't know if you can answer it quickly, but I hope you can. Are children involved in the training because you're talking about parenting? It seems that you would need to have children. Ms. LINDA HAWES (Foster and Adoptive Parents Trainer) : They are not. But what we do is we do case studies of real cases. And we introduced eight children to them that are not actually there. And we even take them into some role-playing. What would they do when this situation if that happened in their home? \n\n ###",

Here's part of it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : (Reading) The reports of my comments do not, in any way, accurately reflect my career of devotion to enforcing federal laws designed to assure fair and equal access to the ballot. I am honored to have the opportunity to do this work and I am honored to serve with the dedicated employees of the voting section who, day-in and day-out, work hard to protect the rights of all Americans under the Voting Rights Act. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We now have a guest who supports Tanner's role at the Justice Department. Joe L. Reed is chairman of the Alabama Democratic Conference. He's also associate executive secretary of the Alabama Education Association, and a longtime friend of John Tanner's. Thanks for coming on. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Thanks for having me. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you were listening to Congressman Davis' remarks. Do those reflect the man that you know? Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : No, they do not. And let me say we have a very fine congressman from Alabama. Congressman Davis is an able congressman. He's doing well and he's going to go places. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Having said that, I've known John Tanner really longer than I've known nearly Congressman Davis. John Tanner has a good record on civil rights. He's been an aggressive monitor of civil rights in the state of Alabama. He has made Alabama - made the racist element in Alabama behave. He has been on the cutting edge, he's been there for us when we needed him even if he made the - these comments he made. You know, I don't find them so offensive that, I think, that they - that he needs to be fired. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Let's take a look at another situation that he was talking about. He came under some scrutiny in a 2005 memo to the Franklin County Civil Division in Columbus, Ohio. And Ohio was a real make-or-break state in the last presidential election. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So he addressed the possibility of voter disenfranchisement during the 2004 presidential election. And he wrote: The reality is the allocation of voting machines actually favored black voters because more whites were voting on each voting machine than black voters. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : He basically was saying that white people were at a disadvantage. Do you find as an African-American man that that cut on the situation when many people argued quite the opposite that people in urban areas, many African-Americans were in long lines - how do you make sense of that? Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Well, first of all, I think, we ought to increase the voting machines wherever they are needed whether they are in Alabama or in Ohio. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : I go back then. You have judge a man, the whole man, not just one statement -and one isolated statement in the one case. He worked with us in Alabama to get more black polling officials. Alabama has more black polling officials per capita than any other state of the nation. Alabama has more black elected officials than any state in the nation per capita. The Alabama legislature is the only legislature in our - in this country. That pretty much reflects the racial population of the state by none. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : John Tanner was in the middle of that. I drew real reapportion plans for myself. John Tanner - he would done it the days of Brad Ramos(ph). And he was very instrumental in getting Brad Ramos to sustain his decision and to sustain our position. So we've increased our numbers in Alabama legislature. And our goal has been and we are pretty much arrived at them in Alabama. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : We don't have any chambers of the government, in this state or blacks of over 10 to 15 percent without having us black representation at the local, the district and state levels. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Mr. Reed, let me just - one last thing. Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Yeah. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : When you think about the way that the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department has been in the news, all of the controversies over whether it is pursuing a voting rights and civil rights agenda, how does John Tanner fit into that? Do you believe that he has a commitment to upholding and even forwarding voting rights? Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Yes. Based on the evidence, based on his record, based on his comments and based on the things he has done in Alabama over the years, John Tanner deserves to just stay on with the Justice Department where he is. And I would hope that we keep one thing in mind, if you get rid of John Tanner, who are you going to replace him with? Because I can tell you, I don't believe that you're going to find any person around there who's going to be any more committed to protecting the rights of individuals than John Tanner, blacks included. And I know because I've been there; I'm there every day. I've been on the frontline of some 40 nearly 50 years and long before John Tanner came on. So John Tanner has a record. If he needs to be reprimanded, I assume somebody will reprimand him. I think the hearing is going to help him ultimately. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Mr. Reed, thank you so much\u2026 Dr. JOE REED (Chairman, Alabama Democratic Conference; Associate Executive Secretary, Alabama Education Association) : Yes. \n\n ###",

Hey, it's just 39 days. ANTHONY MACKIE : (as Sergeant J.T. Sanborn) Thirty-eight if we survive today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Then in \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" Mackie played a mysterious agent who challenged Matt Damon's perceptions of fate and free will. MATT DAMON : (as David Norris) You freeze people. You froze my friend. ANTHONY MACKIE : (as Harry Mitchell) We need special authorization to do. MATT DAMON : (as David Norris) You poke around in people's brain to make them think whatever you want. ANTHONY MACKIE : (as Harry Mitchell) Be quite, David. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : Can I get you something? MATT DAMON : (as David Norris) Just some water, please. ANTHONY MACKIE : (as Harry Mitchell) We can't talk here. Meet me on the 4 p.m. boat and I'll answer what I can. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you can catch Anthony Mackie right now at your local Megaplex as a cop caught up in the midst of a diamond heist in \"Man on a Ledge.\" And Anthony Mackie joins us now from a studio in New Orleans. Nice to have you with us today. ANTHONY MACKIE : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I think in something of a coincidence, didn't you star in a film about Langston Hughes? ANTHONY MACKIE : I did. I starred in a film called \"Brother to Brother,\" which was about a young poet trying to find his way and his voice through literature, and Langston Hughes was one of the variety of actors we used to help him understand what it meant to be a Harlem Renaissance poet. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And following up on our question, so you're familiar with the poet. What do you think - what did you take away from that experience? \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. ANTHONY MACKIE : Well, doing \"Brother to Brother\" was kind of magical because living in Harlem at the time, I learned so much about culture and history that I didn't learn in school. I think being an actor, I'm blessed with the opportunity to look at different facets of life in a completely different way. I'm able to be voyeuristic in a very supported, nurtured environment when it comes to different aspects of culture. So I learned so much about myself and really about where I come from. And I think it garnered a certain amount of pride when it comes to, you know, my history and my culture, specifically being from New Orleans and all the great artists that have come before me and put me in the plate, given me the ability to be where I am. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll talk more about that in just a minute. I wanted to talk a little bit, though, about your film, \"Man on a Ledge.\" You get to play one of the bad guys. ANTHONY MACKIE : Yeah. ANTHONY MACKIE : Not necessary. Everybody is a little bit of a bad guy. I get to play Mike Ackerman, and basically, I think he's a good guy. His best friend on the police force, Nick Cassidy, who is played by Sam Worthington, was pinched for a off-duty detail and given 25 years in prison. So, Nick goes up on a ledge to proclaim his innocence, and my job as his friend, his old friend and old partner, is to help him out find clues and, you know, basically drive the plot along to help the audience figure out why the hell would somebody get on a ledge. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Two years ago, you were waiting for \"Hurt Locker,\" which at that point had been nominated for best picture. Last year, you were in \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" which got some very good reviews, too. You go opened the paper to read reviews of \"Man on a Ledge,\" not so good. ANTHONY MACKIE : You know what, this is a hit-or-miss business. I think every project you do, it's, you know, six one way, half a dozen the next. I actually enjoyed the movie. I feel like we've gotten away from what good movies used to be. I think it's a action/suspense/thriller. And the last time I saw a, quote, unquote, \"suspenseful movie,\" I was so confused by the end of it, I had to idea what was going on. ANTHONY MACKIE : And I feel like this is a movie that actually gives you what you go to the movies for. You know, you get a Slurpee. You get some popcorn. You sit down, and you can actually enjoy a movie and follow it to the end. And I think for every one bad review, you have three very good, very positive reviews. And I counted it, so I can definitely say that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We can go to Rotten Tomatoes and check you out. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I wanted to ask you, there was a quote you once said that - I think it was after \"Night Catches Us,\" where you impressed so many people.  You said you get offered so many scripts to do exactly what you had done before, and you constantly look for new things to do. You have been the star in some smaller films. You are a supporting player in some of these bigger productions in Hollywood. You're sort of on that cusp. How much choice do you have? ANTHONY MACKIE : I have all the choice. I'm at a - I think as actors we're all at a great place to where we have the ability to say no. I say no, you know, 10 times more than I say yes. And I think I'm fortunate in a way where, you know, I choose projects for a specific reason. This project I chose because I wanted to be a plot device. I wanted to work on that type of character that drives the plot all the way to the end of the film. I've never really played that before, and I wanted to see if I could hold that on my shoulders - allow the audience to be interested in me as a character throughout the course of a film. And I feel like I did that in this film. I'm very proud of it. I'm very proud of the work that I was able to do with Sam. You know, he's a \"Avatar.\" So... ANTHONY MACKIE : So I really enjoyed it. And I think the movie is really good and it's fun. And by the time you get to the end of it, you definitely are fulfilled. It's a ride. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Anthony Mackie is with us. \"Man on a Ledge\" is the movie. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And I have to also ask you about some controversy that you stirred up, talking about how the African-Americans in the movie business, you feel, have not done enough to tell their stories. ANTHONY MACKIE : Mm-hmm. Well, I think that statement was blown completely out of proportion because of one phrase I used in particular. And that was a bad choice of words by me. But I do think that if you look at some of the pioneers in this business, you know, you know, God rest his soul, Don Cornelius started \"Soul Train,\" you know, with what, $200? If you look at Robert Townsend, he started his career by producing and directing a film on a credit card. If you look at what Bill Cosby was able to do with his career. ANTHONY MACKIE : If you look at all of these people from the analogs of African-American history in entertainment, they gave us a blueprint on how to make money, and how to make it work. And I feel like, you know, you get out in the L.A. life. You're laying in the sun. You're being invited to parties. You're having a good time. You have girlfriends, boyfriends. You have expensive cars. You forget the idea of hustle. And I think right now, our hustle game is way behind. ANTHONY MACKIE : I think if you look at what Judd Apatow has done, what Seth Rogen has done, if you look at, you know, what Latino film stars have done with, you know, their five major Latino networks right now. I think we have to work harder towards our own demographic and telling our own stories. I think it's preposterous that we have to look back to George Lucas to tell the story of some of the greatest American - figures in history with the film \"Red Tails.\" You know, I think if we want that story to be told, that's something that we can tell and something that we can do. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I know you've read your critics and your critics say, where is the Anthony Mackie movie? Where is the film he's going to make? ANTHONY MACKIE : Yeah. I read that all the time, and I'm asked that question all the time. And, you know, I have projects that I'm working on and things I want to get done. You know, but at the end of the day, this is a business, and I don't want to put myself out there until I'm ready to be put out there. You know, now it's a slow burn. You know, Morgan Freeman didn't pop in this business until he was well over 40. You know, if you look at Sam Jackson, Sam Jackson didn't pop in this business until he was, you know, damn near 40. ANTHONY MACKIE : So I'm in a position now where I'm allowing myself to grow. I don't want to jump out and then do something that people don't appreciate or don't like, and that I'm a one-hit wonder that you'll never hear from again. You have to allow yourself that aspect of nurturing and growing until you're ready to pop out there on the scene. And that's why I try to diversify my portfolio of roles. So when it's time for me to do that, I can bring a modicum of ideas and cultural references to a role to have people interested and have people want to see more of me. I think that's why Denzel is where he is. I think that's why Will Smith is where he is. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Romney recovers to romp back to the front of the pack while Newt succumbs to a barrage of negative ads. It's Wednesday and time for a... NEWT GINGRICH : Carpet bomb... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Edition of the Political Junkie. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN : There you go again. VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE : When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: Where's the beef? SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER : Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. SENATOR LLOYD BENTSON : Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy. PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON : You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore. SARAH PALIN : Lipstick. GOVERNOR RICK PERRY : Oops GOVERNOR RICK PERRY : PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: But I'm the decider. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Every Wednesday, political junkie Ken Rudin joins us to recap the week in politics. The Florida fallout leads, for sure, but Democrats celebrate a special election. Indiana Republican Dan Burton will retire from the House. Democratic Governor Bev Perdue will not run again in North Carolina. We'll look ahead to this weekend's caucuses in Maine and Nevada. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joe Biden admits he advised against the bin Laden raid. Later in the program, Governor Christine Gregoire on the debate over gay marriage in Washington state, plus a special guest star. But first political junkie Ken Rudin joins us back in Studio 3A this week, after our visit to Orlando. And we begin, as always, with a trivia question. Hey, Ken. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Hi, Neal, and again thank you WMFP for hosting us in Orlando. That was lovely. We had a great time there. OK, trivia question, another convoluted trivia question. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh no. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah, I'm sorry. OK, the thought of Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich being together on the presidential ticket does seem far-fetched, although we have seen people who battled each other for the nomination before, and they've run together in the general election. So that's not new. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But if it turned out to be Romney and Gingrich, it would pit someone who served as governor with someone who served as a member of the House. OK, ready for the convoluted part? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes, I (unintelligible). KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : OK, are you sitting? You are, you're right in front of me. When was the last time such a ticket, compromised of someone who served as governor and someone who served as a House member, lost? And we're talking about a major-party ticket.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : So that's the opposite. So the last time someone who was a governor and someone who was a member of Congress... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Of the House. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The House - ran on the same ticket and lost. So give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And of course the winner gets a fabulous Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And for the record, this is somebody who either the current governor or former governor, current House member, former House member, just to make it even less clear. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Even less clear than it was before. And speaking of clear, Ken, hard to believe a week ago, we thought the Florida primary was going to be a toss-up. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, not only that, I thought - and I think we talked about it last week in Orlando - I thought that Newt Gingrich having a big victory in South Carolina had the momentum, had the great debate performances to go into Florida and perhaps win it. And yet we saw the Romney - new focus of Romney, better debate performances, a weak, I thought, performance, by Gingrich in the debates. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : As Newt Gingrich said in the beginning of this show, carpet bombing, and Mitt Romney won, you know - all that momentum of South Carolina eroded, and Romney won a very comfortable 14-point victory, yesterday, in Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You mentioned one of the factors in the debate, and one of the factors in Gingrich's big win the week before in South Carolina, was the revelations about the - about the - excuse me, the revelations about the income tax and Bain and losing jobs and that sort of thing. You mentioned Mitt Romney doing a much better job in the Florida debate. MITT ROMNEY : But have you checked your own investments? You also have investments through mutual funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Newt Gingrich, not as sprightly, not as adept, not as agile as he was in the South Carolina debate. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Absolutely not, and the look on - I mean, the thing we just heard about Mitt Romney, it came following Newt Gingrich attacking him on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you know, that's the illegitimate child. And yet Romney with opposition research just came back at Gingrich, and Gingrich was just confounded, had no response, looked like he just lost his mojo, and really, for the rest of the debate, he just seemed more on the defensive. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And the talk about moon colonies and things like that, he seemed to lose his way in Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And 99.99 percent of the ads that were run by the Romney campaign and by the super PAC supporting him were negative. There was one ad, I think, in Spanish on the radio, that was positive for Romney. But other than that, it was a barrage of negative ads. And as you say, Newt Gingrich, well, sounded very defensive. NEWT GINGRICH : Lincoln once said if a man won't agree that two plus two equals four, you'll never win the argument because facts don't matter. Romney's the first candidate I've seen who fits the Lincoln description. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And whining about your opponent outspending you five to one, well, that was the fact, but you're not going to win a lot of elections that way. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : True, but money doesn't always win elections, as President Phil Gramm would say or, you know, the people who have poured in tons and tons of money. So just to blame it on money is not a sufficient answer for why Gingrich lost so badly. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And, you know, Gingrich, to say that Romney's a liar, and, you know, facts are facts, and he's distorting the facts, but look, Newt Gingrich did have investments in Freddie and Fannie, he did resign from the speakership in somewhat of a disgrace. So all the things that Romney said - many of the things Romney said about Gingrich were absolutely true. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And they will go on to Nevada and Maine and then on elsewhere. We'll be focusing on that later. Meantime, there still are two other Republicans in the race, and essentially Rick Santorum and Ron Paul decided hey, let's skip it. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, why not because Florida - violating party rules, Florida was a winner-take-all primary. So in other words, unlike most of the other early states, like we saw in New Hampshire, like we saw in South Carolina, you win a percentage of the vote, you get a percentage of the delegates. In Florida, it was winner-take-all. All 50 delegates go the winner. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll see how they do in caucus states, which divide their delegates proportionally, when we get to this weekend and talk more about that. In the meantime, Mitt Romney has sometimes been, well, criticized for being out of touch, the $10,000 bet, that sort of thing. This morning on CNN, he did not do himself any favors in an interview with Soledad O'Brien. MITT ROMNEY : I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich. They're doing just fine. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And of course he meant to say he's fighting for the middle class, but - I'm not concerned about the very poor?

Anyway, somebody mentioned there's a political result, I think, in the state of Oregon. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : There is. I'm glad we talked about that. This is the first congressional district. This is the one that David Wu resigned last August because of a sexual assault charge. The - this has been a Democratic district. The last Republican to win it was 1972. So they should have won it, and they did win it big. But they were nervous about the Anthony Weiner result in New York, where similar circumstances \u2013 well, not similar circumstances but the fact that the Democrats lost a safe Democratic district. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : They won - Suzanne Bonamici won the seat pretty handily. Democrats put a lot of money tying the Republican nominee, pretty fairly, to the Tea Party. And so the Democratic seat stays Democratic. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, we also mentioned Bev Perdue, elected governor of North Carolina, decided not to run again. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Her numbers were abysmal. She had 32 percent approval ratings. The Republicans were really on the ascendancy in North Carolina. They won control of the House and Senate in North Carolina for the first time - in 2010 - for the first time since 1870. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : The Republican's nominee is going to be Pat McCrory, the former mayor of Charlotte, who narrowly lost to Bev Perdue four years ago. Democrats insist that the party is better off without Perdue. Obama's chances of carrying the state are better with Perdue gone, and lot of the Democrats are looking at Erskine Bowles, among others, as a possible Democratic nominee. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Former bigwig in the Clinton... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Who ran for the Senate twice and lost. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And in the meantime, we have Dan Burton, the longtime congressman from the state of Indiana, to retire. But we can't leave the segment without remembering the former mayor of Boston, Kevin White. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Kevin White was 82 years old. He died last Friday. He was the mayor of Boston for four terms. He also ran for governor, and his running mate was a guy named Michael Dukakis, by the way. Anyway, he was the mayor of Boston during the 1970s racial upheaval with bussing, a really tough time for the city of Boston and for Kevin White in the 1970s. \n\n ###",

He joins us from the Maine Statehouse Bureau in Augusta. Nice to have you on the program with us. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : Hey guys. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And if there's a state Ron Paul can win, is it Maine? JAY FIELD, BYLINE : A lot of people seem to think it is Maine. You know, four years ago, Mitt Romney won 52 percent of the vote here, he won the caucus. John McCain came in second. But Ron Paul only finished, you know, a little over 150 votes behind John McCain. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : And ever since then he's really tried to make some inroads in the state, and he was up here over the weekend, at five events Friday, Saturday, and I covered the first of those events at a church in Bangor, Maine. And it was just packed with people, I mean barely a place to stand. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : And that was the story pretty much through his entire time in the state - large overflow rallies of these kinds of voters, these independent-minded Republicans up here who really like what he has to say on a whole variety of issues. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Jay, well, Maine has elected two independent governors the last couple of years. So maybe that appeals to the kind of electorate there. But I have a question about the Maine caucuses. Most of these events are one-day affairs. Maine's caucuses last a full week. Explain that to me. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : Yeah, they go on February 4th through the 11th, and in fact some towns even got going before the fourth. So - and it's, yeah, it's a rolling caucus. And, you know, four years ago, actually, that window there was even larger, and I believe the caucus ended up, finished up in March. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : But, you know, it's a quirky process in the sense that there's sort of a beauty contest, sort of a straw poll vote at each caucus site that gives sort of a snapshot - and that's what we'll I think learn on Saturday, who is the likely winner of the Maine caucus. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : But the delegates, the delegates do not get awarded until the state convention in May. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So a little like Iowa, where we don't find out the real result for another month. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : Yeah, something like that, right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, has anybody else been campaigning in Maine? JAY FIELD, BYLINE : No, no. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have taken a pass on the state. Mitt Romney has an office here. He has a presence here. You know, he has signs here and there, and he's certainly, I think, the favorite in the primary due to his tremendous, you know, resources, his organization. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : But a lot of political observers around the state who follow elections closely here really do think that this time around Ron Paul has a real good chance to win. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It's interesting, Ken, the signs at Gingrich headquarters yesterday said 46 states left to go. We've had, in other words, just four contests, three different winners and could end up a fourth one in Maine. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, and 46 to go, but since Newt Gingrich is not on the ballot in Missouri or... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Virginia. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : ...Virginia, that's really 44 states to go. But right, if Ron Paul wins Maine, he'll have his victory, and as Maine goes, well... \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jay Field, thanks very much for your time today, have a good time. JAY FIELD, BYLINE : My pleasure, thanks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jay Field, a reporter with Maine Public Broadcasting, with us today from their statehouse bureau in Augusta. Now we turn to Steve Sebelius, who writes the Splash Politics blog for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and nice to have you with us today. STEVE SEBELIUS : Well, it's great to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And he's with us by phone from Las Vegas. Like Maine and like Iowa, Nevada is a caucus state. That's really all they have in common, though, isn't it? STEVE SEBELIUS : Yes, unfortunately we have no coastline, no lobsters, no - no L.L. Bean. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So as we look ahead, a lot of people say the - Mitt Romney should have a big advantage in Nevada because there is a significant Mormon community there. STEVE SEBELIUS : Well, as it turns out, the Mormon population is very small by percentage, it's only about seven percent of the population, but the turnout among the Mormon community is very, very high. It's estimated that fully a quarter of the 44,000 caucus-goers in 2008 were Mormons, and so with that type of political involvement and turnout, they're definitely going to be a factor. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as we look at the remainder of the field, again, Ron Paul has been very active there. STEVE SEBELIUS : Yes, very active. In fact, I just concluded an interview with him here in East Las Vegas. He's been campaigning to really raucous crowds. He's somebody who goes around talking about monetary policy, who's older than the average voter; he turns out young people who it's like they're at a concert or something - really excites people. STEVE SEBELIUS : He did very well here. He came in second to Mitt Romney in 2008 and is looking to try to up those numbers. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email we have from Tyler(ph) in Nevada: I live in the state, and it seems like the economy is getting better here. I've only seen one ad for Mitt Romney and nothing else. I think Gingrich or Paul could do well here because while the state went blue in 2008, the red part is very red, also very rural outside the metro areas of Reno and Las Vegas. Would you agree with that, Steve? STEVE SEBELIUS : Yeah, actually there's - people have talked about the two Nevadas. There's really kind of three. There's Las Vegas, where the majority of people live, that's the southern part of the state down here in Clark County. There's Washoe County, which has rural and urban in the same county, and then there's the rest, which is the vast rural parts of the state, which are very red. STEVE SEBELIUS : Ron Paul is going to campaign up there, as some of the other candidates. So there's really kind of three Nevadas. But I think the emailer is right. The economy is starting to show signs of recovery. It's just very slow and very painful, and compared to the boom years prior to the recession, I don't think Nevada will ever see that kind of just absolutely mindboggling economic boom ever again. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Steve, we're talking a lot about horserace, and who's up and who's down. But Nevada is one of the states most seriously suffering from home foreclosures. Are the candidates even addressing this issue? STEVE SEBELIUS : Yeah, they are. It's interesting because Nevada, as you mentioned, is the number one place in the nation for foreclosures. It's also number one in unemployment. But the Republican  solution to that, on the front page of our newspaper we had a comparative analysis of the four candidates on Sunday. STEVE SEBELIUS : Each of them said some version of the same thing, which is that tax cuts, lessening government regulation, is the way to go. I just asked Ron Paul specifically about our foreclosure crisis, and he said, look, we can't prop this up, we can't - you know, these programs are well-intentioned, but they don't achieve the results that they want to achieve. What we have to do is let the free market work. STEVE SEBELIUS : That's essentially what Mitt Romney said. No one criticized him for that. It's one of the few things his competitors have not criticized him for, because I think  essentially they all agree with that. \n\n ###",

He's been out here talking about other programs to kind of keep people in their homes. Republicans are definitely divided and take the opposite view. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we get a caller in. This is Lee, and Lee's on the line with us from Reno. LEE : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, please. LEE : You know, I'm actually just leaving Reno via a vehicle, but I'm not the driver. I have been living in Lion County, which is part of that great rural, I believe the red section of Nevada, but I don't know that it's really so red as it is more libertarian. And I think Ron Paul's going to do pretty well in the rural areas because Nevada's a state where people don't want to be told what to think, don't want to be told what to do, and some of the Republican interference in personal lives doesn't wash too well here. Overall, I think a lot of the people who pushed Nevada into the blue in the election four years ago, many of them have left. And I was working in a library in Lyon County, and my husband and I, we lost our home to foreclosure. Our business closed. And I had to leave my job at the library. LEE : And the time I was working there I just saw people - I mean, the burden on social services in the rural parts of Nevada has just gone up, up, up, and the funding has gotten cut, cut, cut. And people are pretty angry. And, you know, I wouldn't be surprised to see Ron Paul do pretty well here. (Unintelligible)... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, Steve Sebelius... LEE : ...I'm voting for Obama. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Lee, thanks very much. She's raised a couple of interesting points, Steve Sebelius, one about the - Ron Paul's prospects in the caucuses but then in - what's changed with the electorate as we look ahead to November? STEVE SEBELIUS : Yeah. Absolutely. The rural parts of Nevada are very libertarian. Nevada is a very libertarian state. That's why a candidate such as Ron Paul is going to do fairly well. A candidate such as Rick Santorum whose appeal is with social conservatives or religious conservatives probably not going to find as much purchase in Nevada as someone such as Ron Paul will. But it is a very different state than it was four years ago. I mean, four years ago, Democrats had 100,000 voters advantage over Republicans. STEVE SEBELIUS : That has dropped to 50,000, roughly half, of what it was. President Obama now has this economy and four years or three years of this economy to deal with. Recovery is slow. People are not finding jobs as much as they want. And so it's going to be a much more competitive state than it was four years ago where Obama won by 12 percent. I still give him a slight advantage, but certainly it's going to be a much closer race than it was four years ago because of those factors. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : You know, I agree, and I'm just wondering also the - we also have a Latino governor in Nevada. What's the Latino vote looking like, and are they involved in Republican politics there? STEVE SEBELIUS : Yes, they are. As a matter of fact, they have made a lot of efforts to reach out to Republicans. The only trouble is the issue of immigration. I attended a breakfast in which our senator, Dean Heller, who's a Republican running for election this year, was present. He outlined his economic ideas. He said there's so much we have in common - Republicans and Hispanics - with regard to faith, family, entrepreneurship, small business. But when it came to the issue of the DREAM Act specifically, he said, look, I'm against it. STEVE SEBELIUS : And every Republican candidate is against it to - with varying degrees of intensity. And when it comes to that issue, that's a real problem in the Hispanic community. There was a Republican person there who stood up and said, look, I agree with you on every other issue you talked about. When it gets to this, I just can't agree with you. And what's the future of the Republican Party with our race, our people if we stumble on this one issue? So I think that's going to be a real stumbling block for Republicans trying to reach Hispanic voters here in this state. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Steve Sebelius, thanks very much for your time. STEVE SEBELIUS : Thank you very much for having me. I appreciate it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Steve Sebelius writes the SlashPolitics column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal and joined us today by phone from Las Vegas. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And amid these primaries, we focused a lot on the Republican presidential field for obvious reasons. Last month, President Obama laid out some of the themes of his reelection campaign in the State of the Union, which he bookended with references to the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. \n\n ###",

I'm Tony Cox. TONY COX, host : All month long, we'll be exploring the dynamics of the family. Black families, like many American families, are changing in part because they're choosing more and more to adopt children from other countries. TONY COX, host : The Department of Homeland Security reports that Americans adopted more than 20,000 children from overseas last year. White celebrities have gotten lots of attention for looking outside the U.S. to expand their families. TONY COX, host : But what do black families look for when they choose to adopt abroad? And what's in store for a foreign child when he or she comes into a black American home? TONY COX, host : Sherry Redwood is a Baltimore area entrepreneur and a black mother in the process of adopting a 15-month-old boy from Ethiopia. She joins us. And also joining us today is Thomas Atwood. He is president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption. Welcome, both of you. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : Thank you. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Thank you. TONY COX, host : Tom, let me begin with you. The State Department reports that intercountry adoptions are on the rise in the United States. Why do you think so many people are looking outside of this country to adopt especially, especially when there are still a lot of American children who need homes and families, and especially among that group, black children? Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Well, Tony, there are both some myths and some realities that cause people to turn towards - internationally for adoption. If you think about adopting an infant domestically, well, there are many more couples seeking to adopt babies and there are babies to be adopted. That's a reality. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : But the - but when you look at adopting out of foster care, there's a myth there, and that is that the child is going to cause problems for the family. And that's not really, generally, the case. I mean, all of the children can be challenging to parents. But the - when you adopt a child out of foster care, you're going to know what you're getting into usually. So it's - that kind of reason for going abroad is based on a myth. TONY COX, host : So there people that think, basically, that it will be easier to deal with the system as well as the child if you get one from another country. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : There is a reality, too, Tony, to adopting out of foster care and that is that you foster parent a child for a few years and still not be able to adopt him or her. In the meantime, you've fallen in love with the child, and the - but the child may be returned. When you're adopting internationally, it has its own challenges, but it - in some ways, it's a little bit more predictable than adopting domestically. TONY COX, host : In what way would it be more predictable? Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Well, an agency can tell you when in any given a country how much time we're talking about, what the process is with some predictability. Now, there are some surprises in the international adoption, too, though. There can be some reactions, some nationalistic reaction within countries opposed to international adoption that can cause a country to shut down or slow down. TONY COX, host : Let's talk to Sherry for a moment about her particular experiences. Sherry, you and your husband have a kid in college and two teenagers, is that right? Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : Yes. TONY COX, host : Now, you're adding to your family by adopting a child from Ethiopia. So question number one is this: Why did you look outside to U.S. to adopt to begin with? And secondly, why Ethiopia in particular? Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : We looked outside the U.S. We really enjoy raising children and we feel like we have a lot to offer as a family. But we wanted to try to make the best impact that we could in terms of humanitarian gesture and humanitarian effort. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : When you look at the situation in the pre-emerging and developing countries and you find that there - for instance, there's one doctor for every 35,000 people, and you find that only 11 percent of a population has access to safe water. And you see that there are children there who need a good home and who could benefit from the potential here in America. That made it an easy choice. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : Ethiopia, specifically, we chose - we were definitely looking for an African country because we are African-American and we want the child to be comfortable in America, you know, racially and also socially. Ethiopia, in particular, because it's one of the countries that has a cooperative stance, and the agency that we're working with is already there with non-governmental programs to assist the country as well as to do the adoption. \n\n ###",

And secondly, has the process with Ethiopia gone as you would have expected, because Tom just said that on occasion, international adoption can go - he didn't say more smoothly, but that was sort of the implication. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : I - we have not had a relationship with a - with domestic adoption, although, we would not rule out foster care and I can comment on that later. When we decided to go with an international adoption, my husband and I - and we explained to our family it's a tenuous process, although, you know, you do what you can. It is arduous and it is tenuous and you always have to remember that, although, we have been - we have had a child referred to us, something could happen politically or just within the government agency that administers the adoption process and they could call us tomorrow and say it's all off. TONY COX, host : Mm-hmm. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : And you - I think you have to go into it with that expectation. TONY COX, host : Tom, I want to talk a little bit about what Sherry made reference to with regard to Ethiopia and a sort of political/social consciousness that she and her husband had with regard to where they wanted to adopt and why. TONY COX, host : Ethiopia was ranked number five on the list of countries where Americans adopt children. Haiti ranked number 11. Why are those countries particularly attractive do you think? Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : The biggest factor in a country being open to international adoption is simply the policy of the government. If the government is open to this child welfare program, then adoptions will proceed. If they're not, they won't. Because adoption agencies are eager to serve the children. This is what brings adoption agencies into this line of work. It's desiring to help children, and they will go where they have a cooperative government. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : We are delighted to see the growth in the number of African adoptions. There are - there are still many - it's still, you know, very small amount compared to the orphan challenge in Africa. And for that matter, that's true of any country of origin for international adoption. But Ethiopia has been a country that has grown in its commitment to this child welfare program. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : But as she said, this can be - this can change in a moment. Fortunately, every country of origin is - has a double-mindedness towards international adoption because the natural instinct of a country to want to be able to take care of their children themselves. And to a certain extent, we would - you can respect that. However, we really have to look at it from the perspective of the child. TONY COX, host : Mm-hmm. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : The child has a greater interest in having a family than growing up in a country in which he or she happens to have been born, while domestic adoption is certainly the preferable option and a great option for a child. If it's not happening, then we shouldn't let national boundaries and national pride prevent children from having families. TONY COX, host : I want to talk to Sherry some more, specifically about her adoption, but I have one more question for you, Tom, and it's this. We mentioned that Ethiopia was number five on the list, Haiti at number 11. What country, just curiously, is number one on the list of countries that Americans most adopt from internationally? Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : China, then Guatemala, Russia, Korea and those countries have been the highest ranking for quite sometime. TONY COX, host : For a long time. Mm-hmm. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Sherry is right, by the way, I want to just make sure we're clear on this, that adoptions - all type of adoptions are challenging and have their process idiosyncrasies that are going to be challenging and emotional for parents to deal with, but international adoption is a good option. And basically, people have to explore them all. Adoption is a calling. TONY COX, host : Well, let me just stop you there, only because I want to\u2026 Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Yeah. TONY COX, host : \u2026first of all, let people know what we're talking about and who we are. TONY COX, host : You're listening to NPR's NEWS & NOTES. And I'm Tony Cox. TONY COX, host : If you're just tuning it, we are talking about blacks adopting children overseas with Thomas Atwood whom you just heard, who is president and CEO of the National Council for Adoption, as well as Sherry Redwood, who is a mother and entrepreneur in the Baltimore area, and she is in the process of adopting a child from Ethiopia. \n\n ###",

In this country, the United States, there's a premium for adopting black boys. They are harder to place. Adoption agencies will tell you both privately as well as out of foster care, as well as out of county adoption agencies around the country. Number one, why did you select a boy? Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : We have two boys and we have a girl - one girl and two boys. And we have thoroughly enjoyed all three. However, we live in Baltimore, Maryland, and the climate on the East Coast, especially in Baltimore, Maryland, as across the country, for black males is not great. But we feel like we kind of figured it out a little bit on how to raise black males successfully. Baltimore has a female mayor who's African-American and the head of the city council is African-American. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : You look at statistics across the country about African-American females - and they have had very good results and then very successful. So since we had a choice, we felt like, you know, what can we do - what can we do to make an impact and, you know, we chose the gender that we felt is having trouble, but we feel like we would be able to support this child and bring out his potential so that he would be successful. TONY COX, host : One of the challenges facing adoptive parents is to blend the adopted child into the family where there are already birth children. You not only have that challenge faced - that you are facing with your new adopted child, but you also have the additional burden of bringing in a person from another culture and another country and also blending that experience into being here culturally. How are you going to do that and explain who he is to him? Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : Well, we had - most people who are adopting internationally have to take classes in adopting and the challenges and the emotions and how to bring a child into the family. And so you learn certain things. And one of the things they stress is that from early on - as early as you can, you incorporate the idea that this child is from a different culture and we will have pictures - we're very fortunate that we do have pictures of him when he was young and through stories and just keeping that in front of him, and also, of course, education in Baltimore is very close to Washington, D.C., which I think is probably the largest concentration of Ethiopians outside of Ethiopia. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : So we have tremendous access to the Ethiopian culture, which we, as a family - I'm from the American South and I have always incorporated my experiences there with my children. And my husband's from Jamaica and we have certainly incorporated that. And so that's a very, very big part of bringing him into the family as educating the children, our biological children, as well as family members and everybody. Ms. SHERRY REDWOOD (Entrepreneur, Baltimore) : Ethiopia, in particular, is a very ancient society and culture. It's the cradle of civilization. It's where it's all started. So it's very important. And we really honor and are glad to have the opportunity to sustain that culture in our child. TONY COX, host : One more thing more for you. Do you all look alike in - or is that going to be an issue in terms of your adopted child from Ethiopia standing out from the rest of the family? TONY COX, host : MS. REDWOOD: Well, that's - and you know what, that will be very important for him. And, you know, we would never go to Asia or somewhere like that. And I think that is important because he does, he will blend in. I - my children kind of run the gamut, but people have said that I resemble the people of Ethiopia, and he looks like one of my children when they were young. TONY COX, host : Okay. And he is one of your children. TONY COX, host : MS. REDWOOD: He is one of my children. TONY COX, host : Yes, he is. TONY COX, host : MS. REDWOOD: He looks like, yeah, he's related to us. TONY COX, host : Tom, here's a question as we're coming down toward the end of the interview. We've seen some controversy over adoption in Africa particularly several French aide workers who were arrested in Chad for allegedly trying to take more than a hundred orphans to Europe for adoption. Chadian officials are saying that it was an attempted kidnapping. TONY COX, host : What are - for people that might be considering this who are listening, what are the red flags to be careful of when dealing with international adoption agencies? Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : Well, you want to work with an accredited adoption agency. You want to work with some agency that has a clear track record. This group in Chad was - by all reports, was violating the law. And you do not want - you need to - you don't want to violate the law here. It's not necessary. You can succeed in adoption, and it's very important that people comply. And when they don't, as far as we're concerned, the agency should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law because it harms other adoptions. It harms the reputation of adoptions when something like that - what has happened in Chad occurs. Mr. THOMAS ATWOOD (President and CEO, National Council for Adoption) : So people just basically need to look at the adoption agency they're working with, compare, shop like you would with any other choice you're making and be sure of that agency. And you can check references and you can check the National Council for Adoption Web site. TONY COX, host : What are the things, Sherry, this is the last question. It'll be for you. We've got a little over a minute or so to talk about it.

And once the adoption has happened, then they begin to find a way to make it work.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The good news, even in the recession, came from American manufacturing. Output is up one-third over the past decade. But over just about that same period of time, six million manufacturing jobs disappeared. About as many people work in manufacturing now as did at the end of the Depression, though our population has more than doubled. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In a piece for The Atlantic and reports here on NPR, Adam Davidson of Planet Money focused on the education and skills American workers need to out-perform their competitors in China and just how difficult it's going to be for people disadvantaged in some way to get any kind of manufacturing job at all. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you work in manufacturing, or used to, what's changed? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, the stories to follow as you watch the Super Bowl. Mike Pesca will join us from Indianapolis. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But first, NPR's Adam Davidson, who wrote \"Making it In America,\" the cover story for the current issue of The Atlantic and joins us now from our bureau in New York. Adam, nice to have you back. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Hey Neal, great to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you tell the story of Matty Parlear(ph), who got the kind of unskilled factory job once common in Greenville, South Carolina, but unlike old-time factory jobs there, there is little chance for promotion and every chance that she's going to be replaced by a robot. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Yeah, I think one of the key things that I learned during this story, I chose Greenville, South Carolina, because up until - right through the '90s, there was this huge textile economy. I mean, for basically 100 years, any - well, any white person to be fair, there was a lot of segregation - but any white person who showed up at a textile mill was all but guaranteed a job. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : It didn't matter if they had gone to school or if they had a third-grade education. They were going to get a job. There was that much demand. And some of those people were able on the job to acquire more and more skill. So they might start off, you know, in the '10s and '20s they might have started off at seven years old. Later they might have started off at 16 or 18 years old. But some of them would acquire skills. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And many textile workers were able to own their homes, own a car or a truck, maybe a boat, take their family on vacation, you know, have something approaching a middle-class life. And that is gone, and it's been replaced in Greenville by much more of what America has become: advanced manufacturing. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : So there's the new BMW plant, Michelin plant, all sorts of high-tech plants where they do still employ some lower-skill workers, but clearly you want to be a highly skilled worker. Those are the only people who are likely to have work for many years to come. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You asked an interesting question in the story, and that is: Why would anybody make anything in America? ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Exactly. I mean, that - you know, we hear so much oh, manufacturing is dead in America, and that is not true. As you said, the statistics are pretty clear that manufacturing, as a financial concern, is doing quite well. But manufacturing, as a source of jobs, is doing very, very badly. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And basically in part because of global trade and China and in part just because of technological advances, U.S. manufacturers do best when they can reduce what they call the labor component of a price of a good. So in any old manufacturing economy in the U.S. in the '50s and '60s, in China today, labor can be a significant part of the price of a good. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : But now a U.S. manufacturer is going to try to have the labor component down to four, five, six, seven percent of the price of the good, and what - the way they do that is far more advanced machinery is doing a lot of the work of making the product, and the worker is just there to either program the machines, fix them when they break, you know, make - troubleshoot them, but the bending of metal and the extruding of plastic and the shaping of products, that's - you know, that's being done more and more by advanced machines. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You contrast Matty with another co-worker by the name of Luke Hutchins(ph), who's had college, he's had years of technical training. He had years in another job. And, well, he's got something of a, you know, innate genius for being able to visualize what the inside of these very precise machines are doing. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : I mean, this, for me, you know, I have a college degree, I consider myself educated, and I realize I don't have the skills, and I probably can't acquire the skills to be an advanced manufacturing worker because of that sort of combination of both book smarts - you know, a guy like Luke Hutchins, 27-year-old, really bright guy, he understands advanced calculus, he understands the metallurgy of complex metals. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : He has, at least a decent grounding in pneumatics and electronics, and computer programming. But then he has this magic skill, which I certainly don't have. You know, inside an advanced machine - the machine he works on operates on between seven and nine axes. I mean, you almost feel like you're talking about string theory. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Like, you're in a nine-dimensional universe where you have to picture one part rotating one way, where a cutting tool is coming in at some oblique angle and spinning in a different way, and you have to sort of have a sense of how these two, how the cutting tool and the particular alloy of metal are going to interact. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : It's - it takes - it's a real intellectual pursuit. And this guy Luke and one of his colleagues Ralph(ph), young, they - much like you and I, I have to say, in the jobs we've chosen - they are on a lifelong intellectual journey. They're learning more and more about metallurgy, the cutting properties of different instruments, physics, and that's how they see their jobs, as a constant learning and investigation of how to make physical things more cheaply, more efficiently, more accurately. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And that's what it takes. You need to have that kind of intellectual agility, that excitement about acquiring new knowledge, I think, to be a truly successful factory worker today. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, we want to hear from those of you who work, or used to, in manufacturing and how that has changed. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. We'll start with Aaron(ph), Aaron's with us from Detroit. AARON : Good afternoon, and thank you so much for having me on the phone. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure, go ahead, please. AARON : Yeah, I just wanted to call up and make the comment, I've been working - I'm from Detroit, I've been working in advanced manufacturing for about 11 years now. It's a small company, modular aluminum technology. We make conveyors and guarding and end-of-arm tools for robots and everything else. AARON : And I just wanted to point out that, through my eyes, I've seen two things happen over the past decade. The first would be that we don't necessarily make things in America, anymore, especially in Michigan - such as toasters or cars or refrigerators - but we make the things that make those things, and we make them better than anybody else in North America. AARON : And I would also add that there's been a giant shift in the last 10 years with the downfall of the domestic auto industry. Whereas, you know, the tool that we used to build to put in a windshield, you know, is now picking up solar panels or pieces of drywall or forest products. And really, today's advanced manufacturing, with robotics and all these other machines, really transcend any one product. AARON : And now it's almost like if you're going to make an assembly line, you kind of play the cup game with some established machinery, and they you just connect them all with some robots or ancillary equipment. And yeah, you can make anything, it's incredible. That's it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, thanks very much for the call, Aaron. Let's bring another voice into the conversation, Tim Aeppel, Wall Street Journal bureau chief for economics, who writes on a range of economic issues, including manufacturing. He's also with us from our bureau in New York. Nice to have you with us. TIM AEPPEL : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I wonder what you make of Aaron's analogy, that we no longer make so many things but rather things that make things. TIM AEPPEL : Well, there's an element of truth to that, but I think there's also a wide range of things that are produced that simply don't make sense to produce anywhere else, and they maybe aren't as visible. I mean, the auto industry, we talk about the demise of the U.S. auto industry, but frankly the auto industry has just changed and become - there are quite a few foreign manufacturers that have set up shop here. TIM AEPPEL : And we produce cars on a scale, and after the problems in Detroit, that has been quite a snap-back in that industry, and that's been one of the strengths of manufacturing in the Midwest: auto parts, transporting auto parts, goods that are used to transport, things related to transportation. TIM AEPPEL : So I think that there is a bigger picture, definitely true that we - we're excellent at manufacturing machinery, and that's one of our global strengths, one of our largest manufacturing exports is machinery. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as you've read, I'm sure, Adam's piece in Atlantic, and Aaron, thanks very much for the phone call, but Tim Aeppel, as you read that piece, I mean, he was describing the precision of the fuel injector that was being assembled and constructed at that plant in South Carolina. I think that's one of the things you're talking about. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But those kinds of precise jobs, the value added by not just the machinery but the education of the workers involved in manufacturing that, that's what makes those jobs still viable in America and the reason they're not in Mexico or Malaysia or China. TIM AEPPEL : Yes, and I think what that piece captured very well is the barbell that's emerged in manufacturing jobs. You have really these high-end jobs that are - that require a lot of skill and training, and the other jobs increasingly are ones that it doesn't make sense or doesn't make economic sense, certainly, to automate. These are people moving goods at the end of the line. TIM AEPPEL : One of the things that's been very slow to automate, for instance, is quality control. I was in a glass factory once, and people looking at very specialized glass products are much better at perceiving faults in glass, at least at that time, and I actually asked the factory floor managers about that. TIM AEPPEL : And they said they had tested all kinds of, you know, quality control systems to check glass, and it simply wasn't possible to get the kind of quality you can get from somebody who just knows how to look for flaws. NEAL CONAN, HOST : On the other hand, you wrote recently about, I think, a Sunny Delight factory where the people who drive the forklifts that move the stuff around the warehouse are quickly going to be replaced by automated machines, and as the manager of that plant said, and those forklift drivers are going to have to get jobs elsewhere in the plant, of course many of them will not. \n\n ###",

I mean, I think the goal of a lot of manufacturers today, as I understand it, is to develop the kind of production system that keeps them competitive for the day when demand does grow. And one of the problems right now in the larger economy is slow growth. And I think manufacturers feel that very acutely. TIM AEPPEL : When they automate and become more productive, they produce more with less. If the demand isn't there, they're producing the same with less, and that just results, in some cases, in job losses. But the goal for those companies is obviously to eventually be able to produce more and hire more. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Eventually, we've been waiting for eventually a long time. We'll find out maybe when it'll come along. We're talking about modern manufacturing in the U.S. with NPR's Adam Davidson, and you just heard Tim Aeppel from the Wall Street Journal. If you work in a factory or used to, what's changed? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. Companies starting a new product line must consider what NPR's Adam Davidson calls the continual off-shoring calculus. To do that, they must decide what should be made in the U.S. and what might be better made overseas, somewhere where labor's cheaper, like Mexico or China. It might seem like the answer is obvious : Do it overseas, save money. But money is not always the only factor. Sometimes doing things here in the U.S. makes the most sense, in terms of quality control and delivery speed. Davidson's report on manufacturing, \"Making it In America,\" appears in the current issue of The Atlantic. You can find a link to that and to related stories he did for NPR at our website, npr.org. Just click on TALK OF THE NATION. It might seem like the answer is obvious : He's with us from our bureau in New York, as is Tim Aeppel, the Wall Street Journal's bureau chief for economics. We want to hear from you. If you work in a factory or used to, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. What has changed on the floor and upstairs? You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. It might seem like the answer is obvious : And let's go next to Carl(ph), and Carl joins us from Wichita. CARL : Hi, Neal, thanks for taking my call. I work for an aircraft manufacturer here in Wichita, Kansas, and what we've seen, oh, over the past at least 10 years if not longer, is continual relentless drive towards leaner manufacturing, as well as more cost-effective manufacturing. CARL : Aircraft manufacture, by its nature, does not lend itself well to automation. So there's a definite need for the human component. And what we're seeing more and more is the actual assembly of the air frames, larger and larger pieces are going offshore to China, to Mexico, places like that because the labor is cheaper. CARL : And as a result, there have been quality control issues. So I definitely agree with that. I've been very fortunate. I didn't come up through the manufacturing ranks but more on the service end of things, and I've been able to work my way up from turning a wrench to actually now being a technical support representative. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I wonder: Do you still see that avenue that was open to you, is it open to somebody who's starting out today? CARL : To a much lesser degree, Neal. What we're really seeing, it used to be here in Wichita, a person could get out of high school, with a high school diploma, and get into an assembly job at my company with a very, very good wage. And those jobs are disappearing rapidly. There's still a significant workforce at my company that does the final assembly here. But to a greater degree, and we've seen our company almost halved in the last five years, as more and more of this stuff goes offshore and of course with the economy and aircraft sales, things like that. CARL : But yeah, more and more of it's just going offshore. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And there's competition from within the country, as well. Wichita got some bad news recently. CARL : Yeah, yeah, we've been taking some hits here in this town. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, thanks very much for the call, Carl, appreciate it. CARL : Thanks for having me, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Adam Davidson, again starting out with the wrench, it reminds the story of Matty Parlear. And I think one of the things that really points - that really took from your piece was that somebody who starts out with a disadvantage, like she did as a young, single mother, somebody who's got other disadvantages, who didn't get the chance to go to school for whatever reason or another, those people are going to be on the outside, I think forever, you say. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Well, so I think this is the thing to worry about. I mean, there's - I mean, sometimes I think manufacturing is talked about almost in mystical terms, as if it's the only thing that truly adds value to an economy, and everything else is just nonsense and middlemen, and I don't think that's true. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : I think that, you know, manufacturing is a crude term. It just means a business whose primary job is to physically make something and/or transform one material into another material, whereas services is not just, you know, Wal-Mart jobs. I mean, we're doing a service right now, doctors provide services. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : The service sector is much more than just, you know, really lousy fast-food jobs or something like that, and there's no inherent reason why an economy couldn't be almost entirely services and much less manufacturing. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : So I think we can over-romanticize manufacturing jobs, but I think the key issue right now, at this moment, is that for all of American history, you know, we started as an agrarian nation, and then we industrialized, and then we, you know, radically urbanized and then suburbanized. And with every one of these major transformations, there were - there was a lot of creative destruction, there was a lot of old ways of making a living disappearing - we don't have blacksmiths and buggy repairmen anymore. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : But there was something that came along that provided even more opportunity to the - to everybody, including the low-skilled. And that part is not happening now. So, you know, we'd hear so much about the 99 percent versus the one percent, but this is much more of a 50-50, 60-40, 40-60 cut type of situation. That we have - the service sector is very good for people like you and me, the ever intellectually curious... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Midday yodelers, yes. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : The midday yodelers, who are able to - you know, we generally make more money when, you know, when you have a college degree, leaving manufacturing, you have a good shot at making more money. But for the Matty Parlears, for people who just have a high school degree, you generally make less money and have less opportunity when you leave manufacturing. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And it's not - you know, people say oh, well, that's fine because we used to have blacksmiths, and now we don't, and we have better jobs. But it's just at this moment, it is - nobody knows, I've yet to find anybody who can tell me what is coming next for the low-skilled manufacturing worker that really can provide upward mobility, a long-term, you know, career-long economic opportunity? ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And it's not to say it's impossible that that way one day come, that we'll figure that one out, but it's pretty hard to see where that would come from. So I don't fear for the overall health of the U.S. economy as much as other people do. I think GDP will go back to healthy growth at some point. I think there will be wealth creation - substantial wealth creation. But I don't know that it'll be as broadly shared, and that is new, and that's I think very alarming. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Tim Aeppel, we got some I think decent economic news today on employment and other things and probably expect some decent unemployment numbers for the month of January, when they come out I think on Friday. But this is still I think fair to characterize as a jobless recovery. TIM AEPPEL : I mean, job growth has been the real disappointment in this recovery, and I mean, manufacturing has stood out, but it's good to keep it in perspective. As Adam says, the - I mean, since the early 2010, we've added about 300,000 manufacturing jobs, and that's excellent relative to manufacturing. But relative to the number of jobs that were wiped out in the recession and that have yet to come back, it's still very small. TIM AEPPEL : And I think manufacturing, some of the sort of mystical nature of manufacturing that we have to also keep in mind here is that the sort of divergence between the kinds of skills on the factory floor also have kind of changed the value of those jobs. So there's a lot of manufacturing jobs, kind of the like the woman that Adam wrote about, that the upward limits of pay are pretty - are pretty limited. TIM AEPPEL : And in the past, you had people who would go into a manufacturing plant out of high school, start driving a forklift, start doing basic things and pick up more and more and basically move up... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah, like our caller from Wichita started as a wrench-turner and now seems to be making a pretty good living, yeah. TIM AEPPEL : Exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And that is - I mean, you can still meet people in their 40s who have that story to tell. I meet very few people in their 30s and almost no people in their 20s who can say yeah, I started here as a low-skilled worker, and on the job I acquired those skills. That's very rare. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Can I mention one other thing is the caller talked about lean manufacturing. That's not just a generic term. That's, you know, sort of a precise term referring generally to the application of what the Toyota production system. And this is really the revolution of the last 20 years or so, or 15 years or whatever it is, in American manufacturing. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Some people say it was - anyway, the dating is controversial, but you really do see factories making higher quality products with half the workforce. That's a typical narrative is lean allows them to, without - even without investing in huge new machines, just by really studying the systems you have in place, figuring out how stuff moves from one person to another, how much inventory you keep on hand, you can find, using this Japanese approach, you can find massive savings on labor. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : And that has, I think, the statistics are fairly clear, that has cost a lot more jobs that outsourcing manufacturing to China. That is really hallowing out this work. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Email exactly to this point from Paul(ph) in Peoria: I've worked at a large Midwest manufacturer of yellow bulldozers for 35 years. In that 35 years, our factory workforce has shrunk by about two-thirds. We now produce three to four times as much product, so productivity has gone through the roof. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also, when I started in the factory - I've long since moved to management - I worked with people who were functionally illiterate. Today we start with something like nine to 10 high school grads to fill one factory job. Many of the people in the factory have at least some college. And I think we can all guess what that yellow tractor company is. \n\n ###",

Alan's with us from Pittsburgh. ALAN : Hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, you're on the air, go ahead, please. ALAN : Hi there, yeah. Actually, I'm trying to - I have a product, a new product. I'm an entrepreneur, product developer, and I desperately want to be able to make my product here in the USA. I've gotten figures from China, and I'm - I've also gotten figures from the USA. And a few things that I'm noticing are I'm 50 to 60 thousand apart. In the U.S. it's more expensive for the tooling. I also know that for my product in particular, which is relatively small, handheld, it's going to cost me about a dollar per unit just to get it here from China to - and that's just to the East Coast or the West Coast. ALAN : Then I've got to do some shipping to get it to, you know, a fulfillment house. Also, it's going to cost me more money for insurance if I make it in China rather than the USA. And the time, it takes about six weeks minimum to get something shipped from China to the U.S. So for many reasons, I desperately want to make this in the USA, and I'm trying to figure out how to do that. You know, I've got good numbers. You know, I'm getting closer, but I'm still maybe $70,000 difference by making it in the USA. So questions are: Are the American people willing and other people willing to pay more for something that's made in the USA? ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : That's an easy one. ALAN : If it costs me $4 - if it costs me $1 per unit just to ship it here, that translates to $4 per unit retail. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Adam, a simple one, I think the answer is no. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Yeah. The answer is absolutely not. I mean, this is something that economists... ALAN : Absolutely not what? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Will Americans... ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Yeah. People will not pay more for made in America. They say they will. Surveys, you know, you can do surveys where people will say I'd pay twice as much for made in America. I always buy made in America. But all you have to do is compare any product that's made in America and costs more to a product that costs less. People, you know, the market, you know, the market, which economists talk about, you know, that's the real poll. That's what - where the rubber hits the road. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : You can't charge a penny more. I mean, it's just not - it's not a true value that the American consumer has in any vast way. I'm sure there are, you know, small discreet little areas where, you know, and some people might choose to buy a lot. This thing I buy because it's made in America. But probably they're buying most of their clothes that wasn't made in America, et cetera, which, by the way, is not a problem. In fact, increased productivity should not be seen as a horrible disaster. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : I mean, we - if you phrase it as factories employ far fewer people, you know, it sounds like, oh my God, those terrible factories. Why would they do such an evil thing? But productivity growth is the only way for a society to get richer, because of productivity growth we're not all hunter-gatherers or subsistence farmers. And this world, you know, this world is filled with subsistence farmers still in very poor countries. We need much more productivity growth all over the world. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : That's not the issue. The issue is, what comes next? I mean, I don't think the solution to America is to somehow make manufacturing less productive or force manufacturers to hire more people than they need. It's not even to force manufacturers to make stuff in the U.S. even if they can make it cheaper overseas. It's figuring out: How do you get the low-skilled worker to have in-demand skills that the market really demands? NEAL CONAN, HOST : So education. So some of the \u2013 solving a lot of the social problems that leave them disadvantaged in the first place and make it difficult for a (unintelligible) to get the education she needs, to get that to second-tier job? ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : Exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE : You know, in the post-war period, we had such broad-based growth that it masked some of those issues because you could have a dysfunctional home, a really lousy education, and you could still go to Detroit or go to Chicago or, you know, go to Greenville, South Carolina, and get a job. That's much less the case now. ALAN : So does this mean that that someone who would like to produce something in America should not? \n\n ###",

Eighteen years old and just out of high school, he saw sunset on the muddy Mississippi from a train and wrote the poem that introduced the world to Langston Hughes, \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers.\" LANGSTON HUGHES : I've known rivers. I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. My soul has grown deep like the rivers. I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it. I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset. LANGSTON HUGHES : I've known rivers. Ancient, dusky rivers. My soul has grown deep like the rivers. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Langston Hughes would have been 110 yesterday; he died in 1967.

Nikky Finney, the winner of the 2011 National Book Award for Poetry, joins us. She's a professor of English at the University of Kentucky, with us from member station WUKY in Lexington. Nice to have you back with us. NIKKY FINNEY : Thank you, Neal, thank you so much. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And when your students first come into class, what do they know about Langston Hughes? NIKKY FINNEY : They usually know the first poems that they might have been taught by a teacher, that kind of thing. They know something about the Harlem Renaissance. They know a little bit, perhaps, about the blues motif that ran throughout so much of his work. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But there is so much more. NIKKY FINNEY : Oh, there's so much more. You asked in your opening comments what should we teach, what should we be talking about in terms of Langston Hughes today, and I would just answer: everything. I would talk about his essays, which for me as a freshman at a small college in Alabama, I had never read \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\" until my great and best teacher, Dr. Gloria Wade Gales(ph), put it in front of me. NIKKY FINNEY : And it was not - it was in that moment that my life changed, that I understood the kind of artist and poet that I could become, that I could mix politics and poetry, the beautiful and the ugly all in the same pot, and I could make something that somebody might lean into and think about what it meant - what it might mean to be human in America in whatever year the poem was heard. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As your students learn more about Langston Hughes, what do you point them to? NIKKY FINNEY : I point them to - you know, in America, I think we look at the short, rather whimsical poems that had a lot packed in them, but you know, just like many other things in America, you know, Dr. King's \"I Have A Dream\" speech, we play it over and over, and when we pull back the covers a little bit, we find so much more that's there. NIKKY FINNEY : And so I love talking about some of the other poems that are longer. I love looking at his fiction, as well as his short poems, to fling my arms wide in some place of the sun, to whirl and to dance 'til the white day is done. That's a traditional classical American poem. And hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly. NIKKY FINNEY : Those poems are like just so important, but there's so many other poems that we don't study by Langston Hughes that I try to make sure they put in front of themselves, and they get a pencil, and they circle all the poetic devices and things going on in those more complicated Langston Hughes poems. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes, and you're a teacher of writing, and they have to study those devices. NIKKY FINNEY : They have to study those devices. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But there is a moment, I'm sure, where you want to just let them sit back and listen to the rush of the words. NIKKY FINNEY : Oh, like the piece you opened the program with, Langston Hughes's voice, thank goodness we have it. Thank goodness we have it to go alongside what he was saying, because the poem that you just played is so beautifully read by him. And it's just - it's important to, I think, hear the poet's voice alongside that mellifluous quality of the poem itself. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from our listeners as well. What should we be teaching a new generation about Langston Hughes? 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. Let's start with Indira(ph), who's calling us from Norman, Oklahoma. \n\n ###",

INDIRA : I myself did a poetry project in seventh grade, about 1973, using Langston Hughes. It was an all-white school, I'm half-Asian and half-white, my children are also African-American, Asian and white. And anyway, I was given an F for the - I was a straight-A student, and I was given an F - and I was told Langston Hughes is not a real poet. INDIRA : And my English teacher gave me an F, and the ironic thing is the way I got exposed to Langston Hughes was reading Jonathan Kozol's book \"Death at An Early Age,\" where he was fired from the Boston public schools, it's about the destruction of the hearts and minds of African-American children in the public schools, where they're not taught about their history or their value or African-American literature. INDIRA : And he taught them about Langston Hughes and was fired for it, and I thought it was really ironic that I got an F on my poetry project. And I think today, when they are trying to destroy ethnic studies programs, making them illegal, defunding them in Texas and Arizona, which operates to further alienate people of color - and I'm talking about everyone, I'm talking about Muslims, I'm talking from whatever country, I'm talking about Latinos - I think that it's a very pernicious path that they're going on. INDIRA : And I think more than ever, Langston Hughes' poetry, like \"America Never Was America To Me,\" which juxtaposes the beauty that the American dream holds for everyone of every color, and the fact that it's not realized and the pain that causes even to this day, I think that's so important for people to be exposed to. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Indira, I think if you've still got a copy of that report, if you send it to Professor Finney, she might recalculate your grade. NIKKY FINNEY : Absolutely. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, we appreciate it. INDIRA : Thank you, bye-bye. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Arnold Rampersad wrote \"The Life of Langston Hughes,\" published in two volumes. He's professor emeritus at Stanford University's English Department and joins us now by phone from Negril in Jamaica. And it's good of you to join us. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Well, thank you very much. I'm happy to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what do you think? Obviously you've spent a great deal of time studying the life and work of Langston Hughes. What do you think, if we could capsulize it, we should be teaching a new generation? ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Well, I think we should be teaching a new generation some of the points raised already on the program, but for me, what Langston Hughes epitomizes above all is a love on the part of the poet for poetry but a love also for African-American culture in all its forms, and a love of the blues and jazz, a refusal to be ashamed of the realities of one's cultural experience. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : But the dedication to poetry is something that we shouldn't avoid at all, talking about Langston Hughes set out from very early in his life, as you pointed out, Neal, to be a poet, and very early on he wrote \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,\" and that became his signature poem for the rest of his life. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : So he was determined from the very beginning to make a living for himself only through writing, only through literature, and especially through poetry, and that dedication to literature, to cultural expression, seeing the importance of it is something I think we should never lose sight of in talking about Langston Hughes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I was reminded of a phrase just today, looking back at some material - in fact some of the material you were writing, and that was the phrase literary sharecropper that he used to describe himself. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes, he talked about himself as being a literary sharecropper. This was in the '50s, in particular, and '60s. Of course he died in '68. In other words, keeping at it religiously, relentlessly, keeping at the business of writing, of trying to reach people, to communicate with them, reading his poems and reading his essays wherever he could to whomever wished to listen to him, that total sense of dedication to art and also to reaching particular bodies of people and especially young children, very important audience to him. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : That was something that was a signal(ph)  side of Langston Hughes, and helping also younger writers. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we associate him, I think, a lot with the Harlem Renaissance, but this is a man with a very long career, a very complicated man. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes, he was a star of the Harlem Renaissance, no doubt about that, along with Countee Cullen, probably the two outstanding younger poets of the Harlem Renaissance. And there's that essay, \"The Negro Speaks of - the Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\" that was a kind of manifesto of the writers of the Harlem Renaissance. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. In 1955, Langston Hughes recorded selections from his volume \"The Dreamkeeper\" for Folkways Records. He wrote that book especially for young readers at the suggestion of Cleveland librarian Effie Lee Powers(ph). Here's Hughes reading one of those poems, \"Homesick Blues.\" LANGSTON HUGHES : The railroad bridge is a sad song in the air. The railroad bridge is a sad song in the air. Every time the trains pass, I wants to go somewhere. I went down to the station, my heart was in my mouth, went down to the station, heart was in my mouth, looking for a boxcar to roll me to the South. LANGSTON HUGHES : Homesick blues is a terrible thing to have. The homesick blues is a terrible thing to have. To keep from crying, I opens my mouth and laughs. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking today about Langston Hughes, who would have turned 110 yesterday. What do you think young people should be taught about the poet? 800-989-8255.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Our guests, poet Nikky Finney, and Arnold Rampersad, author of \"The Life of Langston Hughes.\" Let's see if we go next to another caller. Lynn's(ph) on the line, Lynn with us from Rohnert Park in California. LYNN : Good morning. I think it's really important for young people and all people to know about Langston Hughes, to know that he wrote \"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\" as an 18-year-old traveling on a bus down to Mexico to visit his father, who had left the United States because he didn't feel enough freedom as an African-American man, and that Langston Hughes really lived his life as a public intellectual. LYNN : And that's a thing that I always want to point students to because we live in this popular culture where the intellect is denigrated and, you know, that Hughes is a cool guy. He didn't use dialect, necessarily, but he had all these blues and jazz themes and connected his poetry with music, which is why Dave Brubeck set a lot of Langston Hughes' poetry to choral music. LYNN : I'm a choral conductor, and so I have conducted and recorded some of Brubeck's music that's set to Langston Hughes poetry like \"The Dreamkeeper.\" And this word dream comes up in Langston Hughes' poetry all the time. He says bring me all your dreams, you dreamers. Bring me all of your heart's melodies that I may wrap them in a blue cloud cloth away from the too-rough fingers of the world. LYNN : And he just tells us exactly how he feels a bit about the hurt artist, intellect, but that's striving for a dream of freedom. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nikky Finney, that's certainly among the themes in his work. NIKKY FINNEY : Absolutely. I was thinking, as you were asking the question and as the caller was talking, you know, one of the things that we could do with Hughes's work, I think across the board in terms of American culture, is look at how Hughes stressed his love of himself in all - in so many different ways. NIKKY FINNEY : You know, in the courage, resiliency, the strength of black culture, the humor, and if we could get young writers proud of themselves, proud of - no matter what community they come from, writing with that kind of verve and that kind of spirit, that could be something that the legacy of Langston Hughes could be used for and with. LYNN : Yeah, he was one of the very first Afro-centric writers in the country. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Arnold Rampersad, remind us, he did make an early visit to Africa. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes, he made a very early visit to Africa - excuse me.  He was barely 21 when he decided he wanted to go to Africa, and he would get there by any means. And he joined a ship as working in the kitchen and sailed up and down the west coast of Africa, and it made a huge impression on him, and he wrote some wonderful poems that - out of that experience. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lynn, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we go next to - this is Austin(ph), and Austin's on the line from St. Louis. AUSTIN : Yeah, I wanted to mention the fact that I believe Langston Hughes was also a great humorist. I mean, I was - I'm a huge fan of his Jesse B. Semple series, and there's a lot of - it's a very, it's plainspoken, the way it's written, but there's a lot of - there's a lot in there. It's easily absorbed. AUSTIN : And he's not - Langston Hughes isn't all serious, as far as topics go, but - I mean, there are a lot of deep topics that were covered, but it's just the way it's written, it's very easy to absorb. It gives you an idea of how things were in New York at that time and just the issues that people face. AUSTIN : But it was something that was easily absorbed by people reading it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nikky Finney, Semple is a character who is in a bar in New York and explaining things in his own voice, sort of in the Mark Twain tradition in an odd way. NIKKY FINNEY : I think that I could agree with that, Neal. But the other thing that - coming so specifically out of the African-American culture, and the caller is absolutely right - you're there reading these American, these amazing scenes that Hughes has written. And if you're not careful - and I put my quote, the quotation marks up - you'll find yourself learning a world of things about human nature. NIKKY FINNEY : You're laughing. You're at the bar. He's looking at the woman down from him, and you're also learning about something outside the door, around the corner, in Harlem, in New York, in America. And you put the book down, and you can't believe how much you've learned about who we are as human beings. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Austin. AUSTIN : No problem, sir. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Emery Wimbish, Jr., is former dean of the Langston Hughes Memorial Library at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, Langston Hughes' alma mater. As a young student at Atlanta University, he met Langston Hughes, and he joins us now from his home at Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. Nice to have you with us today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : EMERY WIMBISH, JR.: Yes, I'm very pleased to be with you. I'm excited to be with you. I met Mr. Hughes when he came to Atlanta to teach at the university as a professor of creative writing. He was the first professor to have that title. I later had the privilege of hearing him talk to students. He was a guest lecturer in my English class at Clark College. Dr. Brooks invited him, and he virtually had a symposium. NEAL CONAN, HOST : He came, and he read many of his poems, many of the poems that we have heard today. It was a great pleasure to have that experience. Later I was able to get funds to invite Mr. Hughes to speak at his alma mater, Lincoln University. He did that long before his fraternity invited him, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. NEAL CONAN, HOST : He came, and he gave a public lecture. That lecture was in Mary Dodd Brown Memorial Chapel. And finally, I had the great honor of being a - the temporary guardian of his gift to Lincoln University. He gave a collection of books, manuscripts and other memorabilia, which is housed in Langston Hughes Memorial Library today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It must have been - I've read that in fact he liked to go to the dorms and hang out with the students and tell stories. It must have been extraordinary to have that opportunity. LANGSTON HUGHES : He certainly liked that. He liked the informal meeting with students. And you're quite right: He liked the formal lecture, but he also really liked to just sit around in the lounges in the dormitories and talk with students. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Do you remember anything he may have told you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : JR.: Well, there were things that he told me that I certainly can't recall at this moment. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Your memory, sir, is better than mine. Thank you so much for your time today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : JR.: Thank you very much for the opportunity. \n\n ###",

Email from James: His travel writings were simply fabulous, some of the most insightful and fun to read among travel books. Especially good is his humorous stories of the very religious sisters he lived with in Mexico City, their views on his chosen friends and his amorous experiences in Russia. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Arnold Rampersad, yes, the amorous experiences in Russia, but those visits to Russia would come back to haunt him. They would be amongst the controversial passages of his life. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes. Around 1932, '33, he began writing some of the most radical poems ever penned by an American writer. He stopped writing about blues and jazz, and, recognizing the particular pressures, economic and political pressures of the age, he made himself into a radical poet. And he wrote one poem in particular, \"Goodbye Christ,\" which goes on to say, you know, hello to the worker peasant, me. That came back to haunt him. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : When people on the far right began to go after him very seriously in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and he ended up before Senator McCarthy's famous or infamous subcommittee, he was forced to retreat, in fact, and to declare that poem in particular an aberration of his youth. How much he regretted having written it, I don't know, but he certainly was forced to take it back. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we hear the reverence in Emery Wimbish's voice of the - some members of the African-American community. In the 1960s, that was not always the case. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : I beg your pardon? NEAL CONAN, HOST : There was - there were some elements of the Black Power movement that, well, had some skepticism about Langston Hughes. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes, that's quite true. I mean, other poets got it worse than Langston Hughes, but it's a measure of the slight insanity of the times that Langston Hughes' credentials should have been called into question since he virtually invented the concept of black arts in the 1920s. But, yes, he felt a little bit of the hot breath of that particular brand of radicalism. But, well, he died in 1968, before, I guess, it could become worse than it already had been for him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet, today - due in no small part to your work, but today regarded as one of the major artists of the 20th century. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Yes, that is quite true. And he lived to see his beliefs vindicated, his faith in black people, his extraordinary love of black people and his extraordinary love of America, he lived to see those ideas vindicated by time. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hmm. Interesting. Arnold Rampersad, thank you so much for your time today. We appreciate it. ARNOLD RAMPERSAD : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Arnold Rampersad, professor emeritus at Stanford University's English Department, author of \"The Life of Langston Hughes,\" which was published in two volumes, and joined us today on the phone from Negril in Jamaica. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Nikky Finney is still with us from WUKY in Kentucky. And, Nikky, I know we've asked you to read one of Langston Hughes' poems. NIKKY FINNEY : Yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Would you go ahead? NIKKY FINNEY : Absolutely. \"Let America be America Again,\" by Langston Hughes. NIKKY FINNEY : (Reading) Let America be America again. Let it be the dream it used to be. Let it be the pioneer on the plain, seeking a home where he himself is free. America never was America to me. Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed. Let it be that great, strong land of love where never kings connive, nor tyrants scheme, that any man be crushed by one above. It never was America to me. NIKKY FINNEY : (Reading) Oh, let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no false patriotic wreath, but opportunity is real and life is free, equality is in the air we breathe. There's never been equality for me, nor freedom in this homeland of the free. NIKKY FINNEY : (Reading) Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark? And who are you that draws your veil across the stars? I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart. I am the negro bearing slavery scars. I am the red man driven from the land. I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek, and finding only the same old, stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So I understand that the future of black CEOs has become a hot topic. Last week, Stan O'Neal stepped down from Merrill Lynch, and this week, Time Warner announces CEO Dick Parsons will be replaced. What are people saying online? BENNETT : Well, on our blog, the conversation focused on whether the departure of those black CEOs was a matter of race or if it was just an issue performance in business politics. One reader, Tambae Obenson(ph), he cut it down the middle. He wrote : I wonder what the presence of Parsons and O'Neal really meant to their individual companies. If they were no different than their predecessors, then it's all rather moot. The question here is whether we expect them as black CEOs to be more attentive to the voices of black America. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we've also been covering the writers' strike. The late-night talk shows are in reruns, the primetime shows could go into reruns in a few weeks.

BENNETT : Well, folks are really mourning the loss of their favorite TV shows. People like Lolita who wrote, now, I have to watch the real Bill O'Reilly rather than the Stephen Colbert spoof. Terrifying, she writes. BENNETT : And others are dreading that some of the realty TV that's about to pop up because, you know, reality TV hasn't always portrayed black folks in the best light, shows like \"Flavor Of Love\" come to mind. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah. We also had been talking about \"Dog the Bounty Hunter.\" BENNETT : Yeah, sure. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And people weighed in on that. BENNETT : Exactly.

Obviously, the passing of Don Cornelius has a personal effect on me and I'm sure millions and millions of other people. He was a great influencer, and I've been calling him the street dancer's emancipator and the soul provider... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hmm. Street dancer's... ADOLFO QUINONES : ...that allows for all of us to be something. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Street dancer's emancipator. What do you mean by that? ADOLFO QUINONES : He gave us the right to be free. He put us on the world stage and said, hey, show the people who you are. Be free. Let it go. Let loose. And in that way, our dancing that was at one time just being, you know, performed in social environments, in people's living rooms across the United State during holidays mostly, and some, you know, small dance clubs, we actually had a television forum. So in that way he emancipated us. He gave us the freedom to be free dancers and to express ourselves in ways that we hadn't enjoyed before. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The moves that you did on the show as Shabba Doo, were those the same moves you did in your bedroom, in your house and on the street? ADOLFO QUINONES : Essentially, yes. There was a number of signature moves that went on to become professional gold standards for the street dance and hip-hop culture like locking, for instance. That was basically birthed on \"Soul Train\" but was impregnated, if you will, in the street clubs in and around Los Angeles area. But yes, for the most part, the dances that we were doing, we were doing in each other's, you know, homes and house parties. NEAL CONAN, HOST : What was Don Cornelius' influence on you? ADOLFO QUINONES : His influence on me was looking at him, being the spiffy dresser that he was, I mean, the guy was the epitome of cool, you know? I used to look at him and think, God, you know, I want to be like him. I want to be like that. I want to wear clothes like that. He was just so cool, and he had swagger then before people knew it was swagger, you know, and so it had an influence on me as an artist, later on as a professional dancer. ADOLFO QUINONES : If you've ever taken note of my career, you would see that I wore a lot of suits and things, and I tend to dress up. So there was a handful of people that I aspire to be when I grew up and that was - one was Cab Calloway. James Brown, we always want to be James Brown. And then Don Cornelius. You know, being a young black kid, you know, you want to be like that. You want to be like the man. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You described him as a quiet man when you were on the show a couple of years ago. ADOLFO QUINONES : Yeah. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Did he take an active part in saying, do this, don't do that? ADOLFO QUINONES : Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Don Cornelius is - was very hands-on with respect to the show. But, you know, he was smart enough to allow us to be who were, you know, and he just created an environment. But every now and again, he'd say, hey, you, you know, kid. Come over here. Do that thing you were doing, that crazy thing. Or he was standing back of the \"Soul Train\" backdrop there that looked like the back of the train, and he'd say, you know, during the breaks or whatever, he'd say, (unintelligible). You still acting crazy? Or... ADOLFO QUINONES : ...he would shout to different people. So he knew us, and he would talk to us. And every now and again, the early - especially in the early days, he would come down the \"Soul Train\" line. So that was a big treat, you know? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email we have from Matt in Portland, Oregon: As a kid growing up in suburban Washington, D.C. in the 1970s, I remember sitting in front of the TV with my bowl of SpaghettiOs hose to watch \"Soul Train.\" I recall being mesmerized by the show and all of the cool dancers. The opening animation and the theme song hooked me instantly. The deep voice of Mr. Cornelius just dripped in hot buttered soul. I don't think I would have been introduced to funk, soul, R&B, gospel or early hip-hop without it. I'm now passing on my love of that music to my five-year-old. We have are own \"Soul Train\" dance parties in the living room. The kid has got some funky moves. RIP, Don Cornelius. That's it from... ADOLFO QUINONES : Wow. \n\n ###",

Let's go to Shawn, Shawn with us from Oakland. Shawn, are you there? SHAWN : Oh, yes, I am. Hi. How are you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good. You're on the air. SHAWN : Hi. Thank you. What I love from Don Cornelius was that there was an entirely new type of way to be black. There was a black world that was both part-African, part-American, but wholly unique in that it was a different world than the blight and the crime shown about black folks in the 1970s. And so growing up and seeing that, it empowered me in such a way that no book could, no music could. But just watching us be that way, positive and respectful and talented, was such a huge boost for a kid growing up in the 1970s. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Shabba Doo, that had to be your story, too. You grew up in Cabrini-Green, one of the most notorious projects in Chicago. ADOLFO QUINONES : Oh, yes. You know, I wanted to say, you know, one doesn't grow up Cabrini-Green. One survives Cabrini-Green. But growing up - I grew up after I left. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Shawn, thanks very much for the phone call. Appreciate it. SHAWN : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Shabba Doo, you - talk to us about what he was like as a - you got the chance, as you grew up on the program, to see what he was like as a producer, not just the creator and host of the show, which, I guess, we all got to see on TV. But as producer, can you talk to us about that a little bit? ADOLFO QUINONES : Don Cornelius, you know, later on in my career after leaving the show, being part of The Lockers and having my run with that crew, I then went solo. I had an opportunity to come back to the show now as a full-grown man and kind of collaborate with Don on my appearance on the show as a guest star. And my impression was he was the consummate professional. And, you know, people really didn't know that he was really funny, as well. He had a kind of a dry humor, but he was a funny guy. He liked to tell jokes, you know? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Can you give us an example? ADOLFO QUINONES : Well, you know, like, you know, just - if you watched the interview he gave The Lockers, post our performance on the show, it kind of gives you an example. He would come to each one of us, and he knew us, and he would make little jokes, like he would say, you know, hey, Shabba Doo. How are you doing? How are you and your crazy sister are doing? Stuff like that. But he was kind of inside joke, you know. Or he'd say, hey, watch out. They always do that move. Watch that kick, you know, or I think he's going to take you down or something - all these kinds of references to the wild sort of dancing we were doing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : People forget your sister was also a performer on the show, one of the Butterfly Girls. ADOLFO QUINONES : Yes, yes, yes. Fawn, Fawn Quinones was one of - and she went on after the show to marry one of the original Lockers, Fluky Luke, and they have a son together. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Kevin in Jacksonville: To this day, I cannot look at those little plastic magnetic letters that you place on your refrigerator without thinking about the \"Soul Train\" Scramble Board. Besides Don Cornelius' classic love, peace and soul at the end of the show, the scramble board was my favorite part. It always made you wonder why they did it, because the puzzle was always so easy, but it's a classic. RIP, Don. Love, peace and soul. The scramble board, was that something that you paid any attention to? ADOLFO QUINONES : Oh, yes, of course. That was the highlight of the show. There was a couple of highlights, but a main highlight was the \"Soul Train\" Scramble Board. Me and my sister actually did that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You did that? ADOLFO QUINONES : Won that one. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, tell us what - for those who don't remember, tell us what it was. ADOLFO QUINONES : You know, I can't remember what the name of the artist was. I think it was Tina Turner, I think, but I do remember what we won. I - my sister won a red eight-track player, and I won a yellow one. \n\n ###",

You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Ray, and Ray's with us from Eagle River in Wisconsin. RAY : Yes. I would like to say that Don and \"Soul Train\" - I was brought up on the north side of Milwaukee. I'm a white person, and I'll tell you, it helped bridge the gap between the black and white community immensely. It was a good time, and Milwaukee was one of the best cities to live in, in between Motown coming through and Don Cornelius and everything. And the inner city had employment. We all got along. We used to talk about \"Soul Train\" all the time. I'm telling you, it was a magnificent part for the black culture, breakthrough in the media that show people another side of positiveness of them and how we can get all get along through dance and being creative. It was wonderful. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Shabba Doo, that's an important point to make. Back when that program went national, 1971, there was a lot of racial tension in this country, and this program had its part in breaking that down a little bit. ADOLFO QUINONES : Yes, it did. Yes, it did. \"Soul Train\" did what most - what the United Nations, in some respect, failed to do: bring people together and communities in different countries together in a way that no other institution or government has ever been able to successfully do over a long period of time. We've been able to do it in short spurs, but not a long - over a long period of time. \"Soul Train\" was a catalyst for respect and love for each other through music and dance. It was that type of big, kind of, thinking show. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ray, thanks very much for the call. Here's an email from Eric in Birmingham, Alabama: I learned as a kid in the 1970s that not every program that starts with a cartoon is a cartoon. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And interesting, this one from Trey in St. Louis: I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons. When \"Soul Train\" came on TV, I knew TV time was over. My mom would dash to the TV and run us out of the house to play. Twenty-five years later, I now go online to see all the culture I missed out on. And, Shabba Doo, as a grownup, you mentioned returning to the show as a guest star. But did you keep in touch with Don Cornelius? ADOLFO QUINONES : You know, I mentioned that in my Universal Truth: Honoring and Preserving Street-Dance Culture page on Facebook. No, I didn't as much as I should have, and I regret that. The last time I saw Don was some years back after a Whispers concert. It was - we were just hanging out backstage and talking and stuff. But, you know, I just - you know, you get caught up in making a living. You get caught up in doing your work and - that you forget what's most important in this world are people... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we go... ADOLFO QUINONES : ...and what they mean to you, you know? You get caught up. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. The civil rights movement established segregation as a social sin, but progress has been slow in the decades since. Now a report released this week by the Manhattan Institute finds a widespread decline. Metropolitan areas are more integrated now than they have been since 1910. All-white neighborhoods are nearly extinct. Gentrification and immigration have helped shrivel inner-city ghettos, and many African-Americans have moved to the Sun Belt, the most-integrated communities in the country. Critics note the numbers, but argue there's still a long way to go. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Tell us the story of how your neighborhood has changed. Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program : What did you learn from Don Cornelius and \"Soul Train\"? You can send us an email now. The address, again, is talk@npr.org. But first, Jacob Vigdor joins us from the studios on the campus at Duke University, where he's an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He coauthored the report \"The End of the Segregated Century: Racial Separation in America's Neighborhood, 1890-2010.\" Later in the program : And nice to have you with us today. JACOB VIGDOR : Well, thanks, Neal. It's great to be here. Thanks for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the end of the segregated century? JACOB VIGDOR : Well, the segregated century is a term of art that I kind of made up to refer to the period between 1910 and 2010, because I think that when historians write the history of this period long in the future, they'll see 1910 and 2010 as sort of bookends of a period where segregation rose dramatically, and then segregation reversed. And integration happened to the extent that all those increases disappeared. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, what has happened - you're obviously working off the census figures from 2010. Correct? JACOB VIGDOR : That's correct. That's correct. So this is an extension of a project that Professor Glaeser at Harvard - my coauthor, Edward Glaeser - and I have been working on since the mid-'90s to track segregation metro area by metro area in the United States since 1890. The 2010 census figures enable us to continue this time series forward. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you say - one of the conclusions is, for example, the all-white neighborhood is virtually extinct. JACOB VIGDOR : That's right. If you go back to 1960, it's about 20 percent of all neighborhoods that the census counted had exactly zero African-American residents. And today, that is down to one in 200. Or that's one half of 1 percent. So there are still a few out there, but you have to search pretty hard to find them. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And also that inner-city ghettos are shriveling, yet clearly, they still exist. JACOB VIGDOR : That's one of the interesting things about this report. There are still segregated neighborhoods out there. If you talk about the South Side of Chicago, if you talk about Detroit, the key to remember is that these cities have been declining in population. So there are segregated places, but fewer and fewer segregated people. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the - one of the big changes has clearly been suburbanization. JACOB VIGDOR : That's correct. And that's a big part of the story. And the two facts that you brought up - the near-disappearance of all-white neighborhoods and the movement out of segregated inner-city neighborhoods - suburbanization by African-Americans is what explains both the phenomena. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Where 60, 70 years ago, a - one black family moving into a white neighborhood had the effect of triggering the phenomenon we called white flight. Has that phenomenon disappeared? JACOB VIGDOR : The phenomenon of white flight, you have to understand, is a phenomenon that's really rooted in an era where black migration from the rural South to cities was rampant. That era came to an end around 1965. Since that era, this phenomenon of tipping and blockbusting that you hear talked about in discussions of the pre-civil rights era, it's much less common. The - I'm sorry. The integration that we're seeing in suburban neighborhoods looks much more stable than patterns that we would have seen a half-century ago. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we're talking about African-Americans and white Americans. But clearly, Asian-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are part of this conversation, too. JACOB VIGDOR : That's something that's changed dramatically over the period that we've been looking at, 1890 to the present. The United States is not a biracial country anymore. And what's interesting is that the new ethnic groups - Latinos, Asians - you find them in - moving into neighborhoods that had been white. You find them moving into neighborhoods that had been black. And so that's really diversifying all parts of the country. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we want to get callers in on the conversation. We also have another guest, Sheryll Cashin, a professor of law at Georgetown University. We want to get her into the conversation, too. But I have to ask you: What happened - your study from 1890 to 2010. What happened between 1890 and 1910? What was the advent of this segregation that you're talking about? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### JACOB VIGDOR : Well, if you think back a century ago, the African-American population was still concentrated in the rural South. So there were just not very many back residents of many of these cities. And those blacks that lived in the cities were actually kind of integrated. Sometimes they were living with Italian immigrants or other ethnic groups like that. It's really the - what historians would call the Great Migration, that started around 1920, that brought African-Americans out of the rural South and into cities that created the birth of what we would call the ghetto. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what happened, do you think, in the last 30, 40, 50 years, to see this precipitous decline? JACOB VIGDOR : Well, if you look at where the turning point was, the turning point was right around 1970. We had the Fair Housing Act in 1968. We had other legislative and policy changes that really made housing market discrimination illegal and stopped discriminatory practices. And so I think we are seeing the legacy of those changes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As we mentioned, Sheryll Cashin is with us, a professor of law at Georgetown University, author of \"The Failures of Integration: How Race and Class are Undermining the American Dream.\" She's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for coming in. SHERYLL CASHIN : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I assume you've seen the same figures that Jacob Vigdor has. SHERYLL CASHIN : Yes. I read the study very carefully. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what's your conclusion? SHERYLL CASHIN : I don't disagree with the data. I disagree with the interpretation of the data. The language of the end of segregation or the end the segregated century, I think, is highly misleading. What the data shows is we've gone from being an extremely segregated country, where mid-century, eight out of 10 blacks would have to move to be integrated, to now only five out of 10 blacks would have to be moved. I think the numbers show that we are - have gone from being very segregated to segregated, or moderately segregated. You know, half of black people, mid-century, lived in ghettos. Now one in five do. SHERYLL CASHIN : But there's still a lot of segregation in American society. I would still say it's a segregated society, and segregation continues to structure opportunity in this country, and it continues affect race relations. One of the things that I think the study does not account for is the lives of children. Children live more segregated - live more segregated than adults do, and particularly children in public schools. While we've had this - you know, laudatory, modest decline every decade in segregation in neighborhoods since 1970, since 1980, our schools have been increasing in segregation. And now children in public schools are more segregated than they have been in a very long time. SHERYLL CASHIN : I looked at a study today from three researchers at Northeastern University. They looked at school districts in the top 100 metropolitan areas. And the picture they paint is one of separate, but equal - unequal. A black and Latino child in public school today, their average existence is one where a majority of peers are minority and many of their peers are poor. Forty-three percent of black and Latino children go to schools where 80 percent of their peers are poor, compared to only 4 percent of whites. So we still have a lot of segregation in society. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jacob Vigdor, is this a question of glass half full or glass half empty? JACOB VIGDOR : As a matter of fact, I didn't hear any statements there that I really disagree with. There's something important that you have to think about in regards to schools. I think segregation in schools is an important issue. At the same time neighborhoods are integrating, school districts have reduced their effort in terms of busing for integration, and they've been spurred on in large part by the courts. JACOB VIGDOR : You may recall from a few years ago, the Supreme Court issued rulings with regard to the school districts in Louisville, Kentucky and Seattle, Washington, basically forbidding them for busing to achieve racial balance. And so you see this increase in neighborhood segregation that's not matched - I'm sorry, an increase in neighborhood integration that's not accompanied by an increase in school integration, and it's because of these countervailing movements that are driven by court decisions. JACOB VIGDOR : And, you know, there are a lot of problems with high-poverty schools. And, you know, I've done some work on this myself with Jens Ludwig at the University of Chicago and where - you know, I think that those are the - these are all important things to keep in mind. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But we should not - I'm sorry, go ahead, Sheryll Cashin. SHERYLL CASHIN : Well, I'd also say there's still a lot of problems with high poverty in highly segregated neighborhoods. You admit in your study that the number of census tracks that you would characterize as a ghetto hasn't changed that much. It's just that they've been depopulated, but still one in five black people live in what you would describe as ghetto neighborhoods. SHERYLL CASHIN : And I'd venture to say that to live in a ghetto today, in 2012, is very different than what it was like in 1970. These are alternative universes where the prison system plays a more dominate life - role in the life of young black men. Some neighborhoods, four out of five young black boys can expect to be caught up in the prison system. SHERYLL CASHIN : These are places where anybody who can leave have left, and frankly, the persistence of the ghetto, I think this is one of the last vestiges of Jim Crow, the persistence of the ghetto and the system of mass black incarceration that's grown up - I mean, since 1970 we have created this system of mass incarceration. That's a form of segregation in itself. SHERYLL CASHIN : It heavily colors race relations. I mean, if we're honest about it, we all carry stereotypes in our heads, and there are psychology studies that show it, where, you know, we heavily associate black with crime, particularly black boys and men, and this is part of the reason why it becomes very difficult to get political will to support the kind of policies that will create more inclusion in neighborhoods and schools. \n\n ###",

JACOB VIGDOR : That's true. You know, I got into this business of studying segregation in part because I was motivated by this concern that being segregated into neighborhoods affects your life chances in some way that goes beyond schools. JACOB VIGDOR : But what really opened my eyes quite a bit was some research that's come out of a number of universities since the mid-1990s concerning an experiment that the Department of Housing and Urban Development did in the 1990s called the Moving to Opportunity experiment where they gave a randomly selected group of residents of high-poverty housing projects vouchers to move into low-poverty neighborhoods. JACOB VIGDOR : What the evaluations of these programs have shown over and over again is that when you move these residents out of the ghetto, their outcomes don't necessarily change. And so that changed my mind about this issue. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jacob Vigdor of the Manhattan Institute, Sheryll Cashin, author of \"The Failures of Integration,\" are our guests.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. Social scientist Robert Putnam, well-known for his research on civic engagement and communities, the \"Bowling Alone\" author, found Americans tend to bond with people very much like themselves in terms of age, race, religion and more, which can be bad news in diverse neighborhoods. ROBERT PUTNAM : What we discovered in this research, somewhat to our surprise, was that in the short run, the more ethnically diverse the neighborhood you live in, the more you, all of us, tend to hunker down, to pull in. The more diverse - and when I saw all of us, I mean all of us, I mean blacks and whites and Asians and Latinos, all of us, - the more diverse the group around us, ethnically, our neighborhood, the less we trust anybody, including people who look like us. ROBERT PUTNAM : Whites trust whites less. Blacks trust blacks less in more diverse settings. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And now a new report from the Manhattan Institute, working on analysis of 2010 census data, says diverse neighborhoods are more and more the norm in the U.S. So we want to hear from you.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jacob Vigdor, one of the authors of the report from the Manhattan Institute, is with us from Duke University. Also with us here in Studio 3A, Georgetown law professor Sheryll Cashin. And let's see if we can get a caller on the line, and we'll start with Jay, and Jay's on the line with us from Jacksonville. JAY : Good afternoon. I've seen my neighborhood change. It was predominately African-American when I moved in and more whites and other races have moved in over the last about decade or so. And some things have improved, and some things have remained the same. JAY : I would say overall that you can't just look at where people live as an indication of the effects of integration, that most of the statistics about African-Americans lagging behind in education, wealth and social mobility have remained unchanged and are in fact even becoming worse at this point. JAY : So the goal of integration wasn't to make a society where you can live anywhere, predominately. The real goal was to create a society in which all people can achieve their goals, and we haven't gotten there yet. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, I'd say that was one of the goals, but equal opportunity, of course, the overarching goal, as well. But I wanted to ask you about that, Jacob Vigdor. We keep seeing statistics on the - amidst this housing crisis, the gap between black homeownership and white homeownership growing ever, ever larger. JACOB VIGDOR : Well, I think that it's important to think a lot about racial inequality. I wrote a book chapter a few years ago called \"The Perplexing Persistence of Race.\" And the point of it was to illustrate how we made what we thought were a lot of advances in the civil rights era, the Fair Housing Act, equal employment legislation, and yet somehow in the wake of all those good movements in the 1960s, black-white disparities - now, it's not just homeownership, but it's unemployment rates, it's income, it's wealth - they have persisted. JACOB VIGDOR : And I think that one of the things that comes out very clearly is that - the caller is absolutely right that it's not about segregation. So we can make segregation go away to some extent, but you can't expect that to just sort of magically make all forms of racial inequality go away. The inequality is still there. It is a more complicated problem than we might have thought it was back when we were passing this legislation. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jay, would you say your neighborhood had changed as a result of the process we sometimes call gentrification? I think Jay has left us, and we thank him for his phone call. And that has been, Sheryll Cashin, one of the engines that is driving change in many African-American communities where they're becoming integrated because, well, to some degree blacks would say they are being driven out. SHERYLL CASHIN : Well, I'm not sure about that. I'd actually like to take up Jay's point about whether policies to support desegregation matter or not or whether segregation matters. I think one of the hopeful things that comes out of this study is that policy choices do matter. The study acknowledges that decades of intentional segregative policies created segregation, and reforms to undo that helped to bring segregation down. SHERYLL CASHIN : And I would beg to differ. I think the phalanx of policies we got from the civil rights movement, including the Fair Housing Act, created a lot of freedom and mobility, mobility that my parents didn't have, and it helped to create the black middle class. SHERYLL CASHIN : In 1950, 72 percent of African-Americans lived below the poverty line. The Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act helped create a black middle class. Yes, there's persistence in inequality, but I can point to a number of policies that continue to have discriminatory effects, including racially targeting of predatory lending that helped create or exacerbate the wealth gap between blacks and Latinos. \n\n ###",

MICHAEL : Yes, when I was young, we were the first African-American family on our street, and I guess we experienced white flight. Whites moved out, and more African-Americans moved into the neighborhood until it was very diverse. And then some of the whites that were in the neighborhood never moved out and are still, in fact, in the neighborhood, some very elderly people. MICHAEL : But I think that one of the thing that is being missed in this argument concerning the benefits of desegregation is the fact that the cultural atmosphere has changed so broadly in the United States and has been a helpful impetus to what was going on in civil rights in the courts. MICHAEL : Give you an example, well, first of all, I think it was Thurgood Marshall who originally said, well, we lost as much with integration as we gained. But later on, what happened was as we moved further and further away from white male-dominated society, and I'm not trying to disrespect anybody when I say that, but the fact is that young white males said, hey, we're not following this government just because you say we need to go to Vietnam. MICHAEL : White females say you know what? I'm going to burn my bra because I'm not going to be anybody's subject. African-Americans, of course we know what was going on there. So we had this cultural upheaval against all of those things that really helped to enforce segregation in the society, and as those things have slowly begun to slip away, we've seen a more integrated society. MICHAEL : Now of course there's still more work to be done, and in this regard, you know, I still haven't heard a politician say that what we need to do is lower all the tax rates in all the ghettos so that we can encourage more businesses to start moving in there and employing people, so - which would probably be a great impetus to help the wage, you know, the... NEAL CONAN, HOST : I actually remember Jack Kemp talking about that, enterprise zones. That was quite some time ago. But it's interesting, Jacob Vigdor, you find that communities like San Antonio, a city that is exploding in population, that those Sunbelt cities are in fact the most integrated communities in our society. JACOB VIGDOR : San Antonio is one of the 10 largest cities in the United States. I've just recently looked up that information, and I was kind of surprised, but it's really true. And this phenomenon that Michael in San Antonio describes, of black families moving in but then the neighborhood not quite tipping all the way, I think that's something that we really saw in large measure starting with data in the 1970s and going forward. JACOB VIGDOR : And what Michael was talking about in terms of this cultural shift, that's a big part of it, that racial animosity, it's not gone. It's certainly not gone. But it's not the same as it was 50 years ago, and that's a big part of it. You know, the general social survey has been collecting information from adults for a very long time, asking them questions such as would you have a person of a different race over to dinner. JACOB VIGDOR : And you can see the change in attitudes that way and the trends in that over time. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sheryll Cashin? SHERYLL CASHIN : I would agree with that. I mean, one of the most hopeful things I take from this study and what's new and really interesting is the decline of all-white spaces. The Latino population grew at 40 times the rate of growth of the white population in the last decade. It is increasingly difficult for anybody to avoid having encounters with people who are different racially or ethnically. SHERYLL CASHIN : And what's happening, I think, in a lot of metropolitan areas and what I hope will continue to happen is a rise in what I call cultural dexterity, the comfort of people being around people who are different. And my hope is that as this rise in cultural dexterity continues, we will be able to create a multiracial coalition to support saner public policies that give everybody, particularly struggling middle-class people, more choices in housing and schooling. SHERYLL CASHIN : And I think integration will help with that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Ellen, Ellen on the line with us from Milwaukee. ELLEN : Well, I'm sorry to tell you that it's really bad here. I've been living here for 70 years, and, well, the only reason I didn't live in Milwaukee for a while was because I lived in a little place called Town of Lake, which was annexed and became the city of Milwaukee. So I've been in this neighborhood all of my life, and we do have a terrible inner-city problem. And I think the last recording was that 50 percent of black men in the city of Milwaukee are unemployed. ELLEN : Manufacturing has left the inner city. There's - these young black men are being targeted, I'm positive, by our police force. I'm sure that they're doing as much - white kids in the suburbs are doing as many drugs as the black kids in Milwaukee, but the black kids in Milwaukee are the ones that are going to jail. And we have - even have a governor now that is trying to put into place the fact that people with a - black men with a felony - or any man with a felony, I guess, but they are mostly black - can't even be hired into the government. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Into a government job is, I think, what you're talking about. ELLEN : Exactly. Exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And - but following up on her point, Jacob... \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jacob Vigdor, the places that have changed least, you found, were in the North, places, well, I guess, like Milwaukee. JACOB VIGDOR : Yeah. It's very interesting. We've had three callers so far, two from the Sun Belt - Jacksonville, San Antonio - and Milwaukee. I'll tell you, Milwaukee is a place I spent a lot of time. My mom lives there. I have a 91-year-old grandmother who lives in West Allis. And that's a place where I was a kid growing up where I sort of learned about segregation because it is one of the most segregated cities in the United States. JACOB VIGDOR : And the fact that segregation hasn't changed much there, one thing that we've learned is that the places where segregation is happening are places that have undergone a lot of population growth. Milwaukee has not really experienced that. It is in the new neighborhoods, the neighborhoods that are rising out of the fields, on the outskirts of Sun Belt cities - where you see integration happening the most. The neighborhoods that don't have a history behind them, that's where you see an integrated group of residents coming in and creating a new history. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Ellen. ELLEN : You're welcome. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Jacob Vigdor of the Manhattan Institute, co-author of a new report titled \"The End of the Segregated Century: Racial Separation in America's Neighborhood, 1890-2010.\" Also with us, Sheryll Cashin, professor of law at Georgetown University, author of \"The Failures of Integration: How Race and Class Are Undermining the American Dream.\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And here's an email from Tom in Charlotte: At my church, which is an intentionally integrated church led by a black and white pastor, we've been wrestling with this. But the church, in trying to take the long view, recently the pastor said, maybe we're building the church our sons will someday lead. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Sheryll Cashin, it's been described as the most segregated hour in America, that Sunday morning. SHERYLL CASHIN : Yeah, well, I go to a black Baptist church in Washington, D.C. But where people choose to worship God, I think, is less important than whether or not we are going to pursue public policies that encourage rather than discourage race and class inclusion. And this becomes extremely important as we rapidly diversify. SHERYLL CASHIN : To go back to one of the things that the previous caller from Milwaukee said, the reality she describes about what it's like to be a black male in a high-poverty inner-city neighborhood is not related solely to Milwaukee. Wherever ghetto census tracts exist and they continue to persist, you have this alternative reality I talked about. SHERYLL CASHIN : And the thing she describes are described very well in this book, \"The New Jim Crow\" by Michelle Alexander. While it is wonderful that in American society there's a lot more freedom and markets to live where you want to if you can afford it, we still have created this alternative universe of mass incarceration. And the people who are left behind in a relatively small percentage of ghetto census tracts do face incredible difficulty in terms of participating in the American mainstream. SHERYLL CASHIN : And if your callers hear nothing else I say. I want to underscore that segregation in American society harms everybody, not just ghetto residents. It harms everybody. The vast majority of struggling middle-class white people are trying to figure out where to live. It's only the 7 percent of Americans who can buy their way into what I call gold standard, high-opportunity neighborhoods that happen to be overwhelmingly white. SHERYLL CASHIN : They're the only ones who are truly living the American dream, where they get high-quality public schools, very little poverty, low taxes, low crime. Everybody else gets a different deal. And if we pursued policies like inclusionary zoning and... NEAL CONAN, HOST : I just wanted to give... SHERYLL CASHIN : Right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...Jacob Vigdor a chance to respond. SHERYLL CASHIN : OK. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As you look ahead to the future, do you see this kind of rapid progress that would shrivel those pockets of ghetto neighborhoods and inner cities down to, well, much smaller than they are now? JACOB VIGDOR : Yeah. You know, one of the things that you learn when you look over this much history of segregation in the United States is that history matters. And we've seen it all over the country where we've analyzed the data. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Ever wonder where your pet poodle or your Labrador came from, who her ancestors were and when she evolved from wolf to dog? A 33,000-year-old fossil, discovered in a Siberian cave, may help shed some light on those questions. Researchers report that features of the ancient skull, including its overall size and teeth, indicate it might have belonged to a wolf on the way to becoming a dog. They say the skull tells a story that may make us question everything we thought we knew about dog ancestry and domestication. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Susan Crockford is an evolutionary biologist and adjunct professor at the University of Victoria. She co-authored the study on the skull published in the Public Library of Science. She joins us from British Columbia in Canada. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DR. SUSAN CROCKFORD: Hello. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's a pretty big claim to question everything we know about dog ancestry and domestication. CROCKFORD : I'm not sure that that's exactly what we said... CROCKFORD : ...but it certainly does shed some new light on some of what we've been thinking about what's been going on. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Tell us about - give us a little nutshell description of what you found. CROCKFORD : Well, it's a complete skull with both of the lower jaws. Most of the teeth are there. The skull was found in a cave in Siberia, in the Altai Mountains, in about 1975. The Altai Mountains are in, sort of, southern Siberia. If you look on a map, it's where the confluence of Mongolia, Siberia and Afghanistan, just to sort of place it. CROCKFORD : And the original archaeologist who found the specimen thought that it really didn't look like a typical wolf, and so he pulled it out for some re-analysis. And that's what we've been doing now, is going back and doing - did some radiocarbon dating to put it in proper chronological context, and also looked at measuring it and that sort of thing to see how it compared to both more recent dogs and also to wolves of that time period. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, what would be the key differences and the key similarities to make it look like it was transitioning from a wolf to a dog? CROCKFORD : Well, the really key outstanding feature is its size. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. CROCKFORD : It's about the size of a large Samoyed dog, so really quite small for a wolf. However, the teeth are still wolf size. So it's this combination of dog and wolf features that makes it different. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So you've pushed this fossil back over 30,000 years. Where would the - what was the last fossil estimate of that timeline? CROCKFORD : Well, in around 12 to 14,000. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow, that's a big difference. CROCKFORD : Yeah, it is a big difference. And one of the things that really is critical, we think, is that one of the things that happened in between that, of course, was the ice age. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Oh. CROCKFORD : And so a lot of places where some of the other fossils have been found in Europe actually were covered in glaciers during that ice age period. \n\n ###",

CROCKFORD : So it's a really important blockage... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. CROCKFORD : ...of things going on in Europe. And one of the things that we noticed was that while this specimen was found before the ice age, there are no specimens similar to it that continue on through the ice age period or after in that same area of Siberia. That area of Siberia actually wasn't covered by glaciers, and so people still live there. And even still, there are no similar specimens that carry on through time. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And so is there still this big gap between 12,000 and 33,000 years of knowledge of what happened there? CROCKFORD : Yes. There are several more specimens similar to this one that we found that were found in Belgium, the Czech Republic and around the Caucasus in Southern Europe and - that are similar to this and about the same - from the same time period. But still this big gap. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. You know, we all - we've been told over the years that the common belief about how dogs were domesticated is that ancient people tamed wolf pups. They tamed them and created them, brought them in, and they morphed into dogs, so to speak. Does this back that up, or is there a better theory? CROCKFORD : Well, I would say not. One of the things that has come to light is that - that idea that taming actually leads to the changes we see between wolves and dogs really has no evidence to back it up. It doesn't mean that it couldn't have happened. It just means that, really, there are - is no evidence to suppose that that's true. So what anthropologists and biologists have been looking at is what kind of process might be a better explanation for how that transition would have occurred. CROCKFORD : And what we're coming up with is the idea that actually the wolves domesticated themselves, that when people settled down into permanent villages that some wolves chose to come and live with those people, and as a result of that colonization of the new habitat, that they naturally became this new species that we call a dog. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now why would it have to become a new species? Why can't a wolf just, you know, learn to live with people if that's what it did? CROCKFORD : Well, partly because of its own natural inclination to stay away from dangerous predators. And, of course, you have to remember that that's what people were at that point in time. They were hunters, and they were hunting big game animals like mammoths and horses and bison. And they were actually in direct competition with the wolves of that time period. And wolves, almost certainly, would have challenged people, try to come and claim a carcass of a mammoth for themselves, and people would have - had to drive them off. And they would have killed them, I'm sure, if they could have. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So to live peacefully with people, the wolf would have to become more peaceful is what you're saying. CROCKFORD : Well, I mean, peaceful is one way to put it. And the other - some of the other aspects that need to change in terms of behavior are the fearfulness, the - and the stress response. They need to not run from people when they get close because it's actually - getting close to people means that they can go in an scavenge some of the waste that is laying around. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And as far as the skull getting smaller... CROCKFORD : Well, what we know from experimental evidence is that some of these kinds of changes are the result of growth rates shifting between the wolf and the dog, and that almost certainly happens while the puppies are still embryos. So while they're still inside the mother, they're being exposed or they're growing at a slightly different rate than the wolf ancestor is. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. So we find evidence that they have evolved before the last ice age. We have this big ice age, this giant gap in history. And now, do they have to then be domesticated all over again? CROCKFORD : Well - and that's what it looks like, is that this - whatever the process that's going on, is it - was happening from Western Europe, all the way across to Siberia before the ice age. The ice age put an end to that because people had to move away and start doing different things. After the ice age ended people settled down again, and the process started up. So it means that whatever this specimen was, it was maybe in the first few generations on the way to becoming a dog, it didn't make it all the way, and it certainly is not an ancestor of modern dogs. IRA FLATOW, HOST : It's not. CROCKFORD : No. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Can we get any DNA samples out of these things? \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. CROCKFORD : That's one of the areas of further research that we're going to try and get into. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And where would you look for more fossils that would be the, you know, those missing ears here? CROCKFORD : Well, we would need to look in an area of Eurasia that wasn't covered in glaciers during the ice age. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And are there people... CROCKFORD : And so that pretty much puts us into, say, southern - or most of Siberia, actually, and China. China's a very fertile area actually, possibly specimens showing up there. There hasn't been a lot of work done, and there's a very good chance that there could be some quite old early dogs showing up in China. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. If wolves were evolving to become more domestic, were there other animal relationships evolving with humans at the same time? CROCKFORD : At the same time as dogs? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yes. CROCKFORD : No, not really. It really seems to have been pretty much sequential. It - especially in those early days. And so, the next one after the dog, a little bit of contention there, but it looks like perhaps the pig. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Uh-huh. CROCKFORD : And then goats and sheep. IRA FLATOW, HOST : When did the housecat come into? CROCKFORD : Oh, it's quite late. It's - it doesn't come in until around the Egyptian period, maybe, you know, four to five thousand years ago. So - and it - again, if you think about even the way cats were used or the way that they were living even 50 years ago in rural areas that they were being attracted by the rodents that were living off the stored grain. And so that brought cats in from the wild. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Were they - did they look different than they would have today? CROCKFORD : Not very much. Cats actually haven't changed as much from their wild ancestors have - as dogs have, and that has to do with this business of how the growth rate changes and how it changes the length of the snout. A wolf has a much larger snout than a cat does, so there's more room for change. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Very interesting. Let's go to the phones. Elle(ph) in Los Gatos, California. Hi, Elle. ELLE : Hi, yes. I feel that wolves - it's all through food and need in the dead of winter when food is scarce. The wolves need food, and the people thousands of years ago were more in tune with nature and would put food out for them. And little by little, they became more gentle and docile because they trusted. There was a mutual trust. And I've seen this in today with friends who have put cat food out for wild skunks and wild raccoons. And over the years, with many generations, these animals have become quite domesticated and quite happy in their homes. So it's always a need. It's a mutual need that I feel really is how it comes about. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, Elle, and thank you for calling. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Paywall skeptic Clay Shirky long maintained that barriers to newspaper websites were counterproductive and self-defeating, that online readers accustomed to getting the news for free would find another way or another source of news. NEAL CONAN, HOST : After a largely unsuccessful attempt at a paywall a few years ago, the New York Times introduced a revamped pay model in 2011. Signs are it might be working. Clay Shirky argues that's in part because some highly motivated subscribers are willing to pay and in part because advertisers seem to want access to those well-read minds. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's not just national newspapers like the Times and the Wall Street Journal. Local papers recognize that dwindling circulation means they're going to need online revenue if they want to keep covering city council, the zoning board and high school football. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So what about where you live? How do paywalls change things? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, an Israeli attack on Iran on The Opinion Page this week. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But first, newspaper paywalls. Clay Shirky, an associate professor at NYU, joins us from our bureau in New York. Nice to have you back on the program. CLAY SHIRKY : Thanks so much, Neal. Thanks for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you wrote a piece on - called \"The Year of the Paywall,\" which said 2012 might just be the year in which newspapers abandon the idea that all readers are customers. CLAY SHIRKY : Right. I think the thing to understand about the model that's being tried now by the New York Times, by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, by the Chicago Sun Times, finally gives up on the idea that every reader online can be treated as if they were someone who is purchasing the paper, the kind of online equivalent of someone who's purchasing the paper when it was just a physical product. CLAY SHIRKY : In fact, what all three of the papers are doing, and I think an increasing number of papers are copying them, is saying we will never get a majority or even a sizable minority of our readers to pay us directly, but we can design a system in which some of our most passionate, engaged readers pay us directly, and the rest of the readers, the casual readers, we can keep around for the advertising revenue. CLAY SHIRKY : And squaring that circle has been the hard conversation for the last really 15 years of paywalls. It looks like now maybe that we've got a solution that deals with both halves of that equation, both the user fees and the advertising. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you suspect that will change things in a number of interesting ways. We'll get to that in just a moment. But first, you - your conclusion is that most people who use the newspaper aren't necessarily reading the coverage of the Florida primary; they're checking the sports and the horoscopes. CLAY SHIRKY : Right, I mean, you know, newspapers have always been a bundle, right? They have sections for a reason, and it's not to maximize the chance that a Mets fan is going to see news from the Honduras, right? There are people who go to the sports section first. There are people who go to the business section first. There are people who read only those things. CLAY SHIRKY : As long as the newspaper was a bundle, no one ever had to care that people were buying it for radically different reasons. But once you go online, and people can unbundle things, where you can traffic directly to a story without going through the home page or any of the rest of it, suddenly what it - the individual choices made by individual readers come to matter a lot. CLAY SHIRKY : And so online it became impossible, really impossible, to get the casual readers to behave like committed readers who would read every section or every story or what have you. In fact, if you graph what people are reading on any given newspaper, the absolute commonest pattern is the user who reads one article in a month. CLAY SHIRKY : And that's the bulk of the head count. If you raise even a small threshold, all of those people go away, you get a core of more loyal readers, but you lose a lot of people to advertise to. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So if you raise the bar, say you can have 20 articles a month for free, you're going to get most of your readers still and the advertising that is directed to them. That'll still sell, but that's not going to pay a lot of your costs. You can, though, charge those motivated subscribers a fee, and it looks like they're going to be willing to pay for it. CLAY SHIRKY : That's right, and it certainly - I mean, what we're seeing now - again with the Times, the Star-Tribune, the Sun Times - is that a small core of readers will come forward and support the paper. And this is I think a really interesting change because it isn't just, hey, we got a new source of money, which is always welcome in the newspaper world, but also because psychologically it moves the Times, the New York Times business model closer to NPR's, where a majority of listeners don't donate in any given year, but those of us who do sign up, become, you know, members, in my case WNYC, become members of their local station give money, are supporting the enterprise for the rest of the population. CLAY SHIRKY : So now the Times has this similar group of very committed users who are disproportionately supporting the paper for the rest of us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It's interesting. You wrote about that in this article: Lest NPR seem like small ball, it's worth noting, you write, that the Times has convinced something like one out of every 100 of its online readers to pay, while NPR affiliates' success rate is something like one in 12. CLAY SHIRKY : Right. \n\n ###",

CLAY SHIRKY : Practice, practice makes perfect, yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So nevertheless, that changes if you're appealing to core listeners and core readers. That changes your business. CLAY SHIRKY : That does change your business because suddenly you care about the difference between the user who just happens to glance at an article and the user who's actually committed to the longevity of your institution. CLAY SHIRKY : Now, when you go to advertisers, typically in the open market, when it was just, you know, here's our Web traffic, an eyeball was an eyeball is an eyeball, as the phrase is in the online marketing world. But when you are actually deriving some of your revenues from users signing up to give you, in the Times' case five bucks a week, what that - what makes that user base loyal and what makes that user base recruit more users to become loyal suddenly becomes a business imperative. CLAY SHIRKY : That means you've got this small subset, as NPR has a core of users that support it, you've got now in these newspapers a small subset of their users who aren't just customers but are approaching a condition like members. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, joining us now from a studio at the New York Times, where she's chief advertising officer, is Denise Warren; she's also general manager at NYTimes.com. Nice to have you with us today. DENISE WARREN : Thanks for having me on the program, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I'm not sure you accept Clay Shirky's analogy, but if you get into the tote bag business, we're going to have a problem. DENISE WARREN : We sure will. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Is this a reasonable analogy, that in fact you're getting a core audience who's willing to - I think Clay Shirky referred to it as the God forbid audience, the people who say God forbid the New York Times should go away. DENISE WARREN : I think Clay has outlined it exactly right. I mean, this model was not designed to get everybody who comes to our website to pay. Clay is absolutely right in terms of the distribution of the audience, and I think this is true for most publishers. The vast majority of people come and turn one article or two articles. DENISE WARREN : But there is a very loyal minority of folks who told us through rounds and rounds of research that they value the New York Times content, they'd be willing to pay to support the New York Times content. And so the key for us in this model was threading that needle - remaining open to the Web, enabling those who are coming to us for that one article or two article, et cetera, to still enjoy the content but at the same time enable those who are very loyal to have some kind of a different experience with us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And threading the needle in terms of how many stories you can access for free per month and the price point. DENISE WARREN : Yes, that's right. We did a tremendous amount of research in the lead-up to the launch of the pay model. And I want to just actually throw something out here, as well. We keep talking about the quote-unquote paywall, but I think it's important for your audience to understand that this was a holistic strategy, and it's across all of our digital platforms. DENISE WARREN : So it includes not only our website, but it includes our mobile devices, as well, and that is - you know, I think everybody knows is becoming increasingly an important way for folks to access content. And we're seeing some very interesting user behaviors as it relates to that. So it's important just to understand those distinctions. DENISE WARREN : But price became very important, understanding how our users were using the website, how many articles they were accessing; really setting the meter on the website at the exact right place really was the trick to the success that we've seen. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email we have from Victoria: I love the New York Times and often thought I would pay for the information they were giving away for free. One day, while I was reading it online for free, I opened up an offer in the mail to pay for the delivered subscription and wondered why I would do that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But now that they want me to pay for the online version, I'm hesitant. I've used up my 20 free articles this month. I'm waiting for February. I think they're charging too much(ph) , maybe $4.99 per month. After all, they don't incur any of the costs of printing and delivery. DENISE WARREN : I think the New York Times journalism is extremely expensive, and it's very, very, very valuable. And again, our research suggests that users are willing to pay for that. We're giving users a number of different options in terms of how they'd like to pay for it. There's several different approaches. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### DENISE WARREN : One is the home delivery bundle, so to speak, which includes access to all of our content across all digital platforms. There is also, going to the other end of the spectrum, the opportunity to access our content just on the website and your smartphone device. That is a much lower cost than the home delivery. And then there's a variety of options in between. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And then there's geezers like me who still get a newspaper on my driveway every morning. Clay Shirky, though, I wonder, she's talking about all the mobile apps. I wonder how much the smartphone and the tablet have changed this equation because they are so much more like the newspaper experience. CLAY SHIRKY : Well, they've changed the equation less, I think, than you'd imagine. And in fact, I think one of the Times - one of the things the Times said in launching this, in launching their system - I don't like to call it a paywall because something that lets out most of the content, the wall isn't the right metaphor for it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Maybe a membrane then. CLAY SHIRKY : Exactly, fair enough, right, semi-permeable membrane - that consumers are increasingly converging on their expected behaviors. And in fact the difference between the phone and the tablet and the computer are shrinking as the tablets and the phones get more capable. CLAY SHIRKY : So there was this thought originally that the tablet would be this kind of ideal walled garden, but unfortunately Apple also shipped it with a browser, and so the Web is still present and in fact more present in the mobile phone ecosystem than it has ever been before. CLAY SHIRKY : And so I think increasingly publishers are saying if we're printing something and then putting it on a truck and putting it in your driveway, as you said, Neal, then that is essentially one form of delivery, and digital is a different form of delivery. CLAY SHIRKY : Most of the kind of pure iPad plays have worked out only if they're newsletters, which is to say for a small, relatively tightly organized group of readers. But once it's really a newspaper, once it means to be a general, you know, an omnibus publication for a large group of readers, digital content goes to the various devices users want it to, and if you add too many distinctions in there, the user frustration goes through the roof, and it stops being worth the segmentation in the first place. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Clay Shirky, an associate professor in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, author most recently of an article called \"The Year of the Newspaper Paywall.\" Denise Warren is also with us, senior vice president and chief advertising officer at the New York Times Media Group, general manager for NYTimes.com. We'd like to hear from you. Where you live, how are paywalls at newspapers changing things? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. Paywalls for news content still a matter for significant debate in the online world and indeed in newsrooms too. Meghan Peters from the social media and digital culture news blog Mashable recently called 2011 the year the paywall worked. Others push back, arguing paywalls only work in very specific situations for certain kinds of readers. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That may not be a bad thing on the national level at organizations like the New York Times and for local publications like the Honolulu Civil Beat. We want to know what it's like where you live. How have paywalls changed things? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Our guest is Clay Shirky, he's an associate professor at NYU; and Denise Warren, general manager of NYTimes.com. Let's go to Robert, and Robert's on the line with us from Fairfax, California. ROBERT : Yes, hello. I've been a lifelong newspaper reader, and I used to - of course, I live in the Bay Area, so I used to get the Chronicle. And I love reading the New York Times online, and I did so for several years for free. And then when the New York Times started charging for it, I think I held out for a month or two, but I can go through 20 articles very quickly. ROBERT : So I finally decided to pay, and I get the Sunday Times, the printed newspaper, and I pay for the digital content, and I'm happy to do so because when you think about it, I mean, most people, at least if you're over a certain age, you used to pay for newspapers all the time. You just took it for granted. ROBERT : And certainly for the quality of the New York Times, I think it's well worth it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I wonder, do you think, though, as a digital subscriber, you should be forced to see all the ads that everybody else sees? ROBERT : Well, I'd like to see fewer ads. I do notice, because I was going to mention, too, that obviously people can get Yahoo! News and Google News, which are good news sources, but the ads on those sites just seem more obnoxious. So I don't know if the Times is trying to have a certain aesthetic standard for their ads, but yeah, fewer ads for people who are subscribing would make sense to me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Denise Warren? DENISE WARREN : Actually, Robert, first let me thank you for being a loyal, long-term paying customer of the New York Times. We do appreciate your support. Yes, in fact, the New York Times does take its ad quality very, very seriously. We actually have an ad acceptability department that monitors the quality of advertising across all of our platforms. DENISE WARREN : We do take great measure to make sure that there's a balance between the advertising and its quote-unquote intrusiveness, or I think obnoxiousness might have been the word that you used, Robert, and we really are very careful about that because it is the entire user experience that really does matter to our customers. So that is very important to us, and I'm glad you've noticed it. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : But if there are digital subscribers like Robert, who is paying the five bucks a week or whatever it is, shouldn't he be maybe screened off from more ads? DENISE WARREN : I think the real answer to your question, Neal, is the economics, as I said earlier, of producing the quality content that the New York Times produces. It's such that it demands both an advertising and a subscription revenue stream. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, Robert, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it. ROBERT : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Clay Shirky, you speculate, though, in your article that motivated readers like Robert are going to come eventually to want maybe different things than the 90 percent who will never subscribe. CLAY SHIRKY : Right, there's actually been a very interesting conversation kicked off after I'd put out that piece, in which the New York Times public editor, Arthur Brisbane, who I should say does not speak for the New York Times directly, he's in an ombudsman role, but he asked about fact-checking. He asked should the Times become truth vigilantes, as he memorably put it. CLAY SHIRKY : And the pushback that he got on that idea of essentially how hard should we push politicians not to either bend the truth or sort of use weasel words to get around these issues, he had a kind of a sophisticated conversation about how, you know, how much leeway should we give them. CLAY SHIRKY : And the universal that came back from politically committed readers was none; we rely on you to go after the politicians and not allow them to essentially get away with distorted political speech. And when you see that kind of uprising - and it happened several times in a row because Brisbane went on to explain his point of view several times in a row, when you see that kind of uprising, you think there is unmet demand here in what those users want from the paper relative to what at least Brisbane's conception of the job is. CLAY SHIRKY : And when you get a paper that has an increasing integration of its social functions - the Times recently moved the comments directly onto the page with the articles, they've made the comments section more conversational, so user-to-user conversation is simply going to be more important and more engaged on that platform in 2012 than it was in 2011. CLAY SHIRKY : At the same time there is this small group of users for whom their commitment to the paper is significant enough that they're going to be handing over five bucks a week. And I'm speculating that when those two forces come together, you're going to see that group of people start to ask for things that are different from what the people just showing up to read the occasional business article or the occasional celebrity article are going to ask for. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Denise Warren, is that part of the conversation at the Times? Yeah, go ahead, please. DENISE WARREN : Yeah. As a matter of fact, we're not waiting for them to ask. We're starting to give products and services to our paying subscribers. So for example, last year we launched two apps. One was a politics app on the iPhone, and another was called the collection app, it's a fashion app on the iPad. DENISE WARREN : These apps will be no charge to our paying customers on those platforms. And you cannot access that content unless you are a paying subscriber. So you're starting to see us experiment with this as well. There's also subscriber newsletters that we are giving to our paying customers that help them understand the back-story behind some of the more significant news pieces that we are reporting on. DENISE WARREN : Again, this is only something that is going to our paying customers. So we're starting to do this already and experiment with that approach. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We should also point out, I think your publisher said that in the event of a horrible event like 9/11, maybe that instead of 20 articles a month, that could be moved considerably upwards as people wanted to access stories on a situation like that. So this is flexible. But I wanted to read this email from Russ in Berkeley : Unlike the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times is available on Google. Just go to the New York Times site, see a story you want to read, paste the headline into Google, and there's the full story for free. You can do this as many times as you'd like. But I wanted to read this email from Russ in Berkeley : It's more hassle than subscribing, but not a lot. A friend of mine who works at the Times told me the paper is fine with people who do this because it ups the page views and hence increases the amount they can charge for ads. Denise Warren, is that true? DENISE WARREN : Yeah, so when we originally were constructing the model, it was very, very important to us to do a number of things. One was certainly - obviously the business objective was to create a new revenue stream while maintaining a very robust and growing advertising revenue stream. DENISE WARREN : But equally as important was our mission, and it was incredibly important to us that we remained open to the Web. We had, as you noted earlier, an experience with Times Select, where this was many years ago, it generated over $10 million in revenue, so it was a successful model, but what we learned form that experiment was that a certain number of our very important voices, mostly our opinion journalists, were quote-unquote walled off from the rest of the Web. DENISE WARREN : And we did not think that moving in that direction really made a lot of sense for the New York Times. So one of the core principles for executing this model was to remain open to the Web. So we were very generous with the number of articles that users can access, as well as remaining open to search and social and all the referral points back to the New York Times. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### DENISE WARREN : When we first launched, there was a lot of discussion and debate about this approach, and we took a lot of criticism for it, and there was a lot of quote-unquote gaming of the system. But nine months later, I can tell you that we really haven't seen a lot of people manipulating URLs or cutting and pasting. We haven't seen a very big difference, you know, in terms of that now versus prior to launching. DENISE WARREN : I think, you know, the basic headline here is that most of our users are honest, most of them are going to sort of abide by the rules that we've laid out, and they don't really want to work that hard, if they really want to read an article, to go back to Google and, you know, continue to operate that way. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Denise Warren, thank you very much for your time today, we appreciate it. DENISE WARREN : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Denise Warren, senior vice president and chief advertising officer at the New York Times Media Group and general manager for NYTimes.com. And as we mentioned, Clay Shirky, it's not just the Times, it's not just the Wall Street Journal. The Journal and the Financial Times always seen in a special category, business news, time urgent, they had proprietary information people were always willing to pay for. But it is more now - fairly large regional papers. CLAY SHIRKY : Right, well, so - and this is I think the thing that finally - the newspaper industry moves in a pack because in a way they've all had the same business model for so long. They've all looked for some kind of synchronized solution to the current economic problem. CLAY SHIRKY : And so when an individual paper would have an individual experiment, it would be regarded as interesting but not evidence of anything. Now that you've got the Sun Times in Chicago and the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis and so forth experimenting with this model, you - I think we're starting to see real movement away from the classic paywall of you pay me or you don't read it to this kind of metered threshold where if you're a casual reader, we're going to treat you as useful for the advertising base. CLAY SHIRKY : But if you're a passionate reader, past a certain point we're going to ask you to support the mission of the paper as a whole, and this is exactly the same surprise as when Radiohead puts up an album for free and asks people to pay, or Louis C.K., the comic, puts up a show for free and asks people to pay, is that people actually do it. They actually pay for it because they think it's the right thing to do - not in a completely bloodless I'm-calculating-an-economic-transaction way, but because they care about the person or the institution on the other side of the browser page. CLAY SHIRKY : And that, I think, is - that - this is going to be, now, a big sorting out for American papers, between those papers for whom readers have, as you said in the article, what I call the God forbid reaction, right? God forbid, the Chicago Sun Times go out of existence. The people who feel that way are going to be disproportionately likely to support the Chicago Sun Times, not just because they think I'm buying content and that's what I used to do when it was on paper, but because they think of themselves as supporters, as people who care about the institution as a whole. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And now you're - we're getting into sort of McLuhan territory here, but... CLAY SHIRKY : Oh, yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah, yeah. Radio, a hot medium. People subscribe to National Public Radio because they think Scott Simon is terrific, or Robert Siegel is terrific, or Renee Montagne is terrific, all those people. There's this emotional bond with this medium. Newspapers, a cool medium. CLAY SHIRKY : Well, so this then gets into the big open question, which is the hollowing out of the American metropolitan newspaper between 1980 and now, where a majority of the content for the kind of mid-sized metro daily papers for towns of 100, 200,000 people. They're not so small that they're just doing community news, but they're not so large that they can cover everything the way The New York Times famously can. And those papers are often a - made up of a majority of wire service content and, you know, Sudoku and astrology. Sudoku and astrology are not categories that anybody has a local monopoly on. NEAL CONAN, HOST : No. And they're - they are available for free. CLAY SHIRKY : Right. And so we're going to start to see newspapers sorted on this kind of hot-to-cold spectrum that McLuhan first introduced. People who have a passionate relationship with a particular paper or - are going to be the people disproportionately likely to support it. But if you turn that around, papers that are good at not just delivering a product that users were willing to pay for when it was printed, but papers that are good at actually getting people in their town or city to say, I like this institution, I'm committed to it in a hot way. Those papers are going to be disproportionately better positioned to survive this transition than the people who've just been bundling the AP newswire and a bunch of comics from, you know, a syndicated service and wrapping it inside a thin veneer of local news. Those papers are going to suffer. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking, of course, about Marshall McLuhan, the media theorist of the 20th century who - I guess his best-known book was \"The Medium is the Massage.\" You can hear the pun in there. Clay Shirky is our guest on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's go to Rod. Rod is on the line with us from Denver. ROD : Hi. Love your show, Neal. It's fantastic. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thank you. ROD : Unfortunately, a lot of the pay scale started to happen during the worst economic downturn. I feel that I have become less informed because of my inability to pay for The New York Times. And I love The Times. I love it. But my statement is this, that because I've become less informed by The Times and not being able to read as much, the Denver Post here in my area has picked up the slack a little bit in the fact that it's put more Facebook posts out there, and I'm able to access it better that way, and I feel more informed that way. That utilizing social media and maybe apps, you know, is one of the things that The New York Times needs to, you know, maybe look into more. And I'll take my comment or my answer off the air. \n\n ###",

There was an explosion on the surface of the sun, a solar flare, and because we at SCIENCE FRIDAY want to know how everything works and why, we're calling in a couple of experts to explain the ABCs of a solar storm and actually how the sun works. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How good are we at predicting these solar explosions? What effects can they have on the Earth? Are there still some unsolved mysteries about the sun and how it works? Let me introduce my guests. David Hathaway is a solar astronomer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Hathaway. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DAVID H. HATHAWAY: Thank you, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're welcome. Doug Biesecker is a physicist at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder. He joins us from radio station KGNU in Boulder. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Biesecker. DOUG BIESECKER : Thanks for having me on the show, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're welcome. David, can you give us a play-by-play of what happened there on the sun this week? HATHAWAY : Yeah, it starts with a flash, a solar flare that we see particularly in X-rays from the sun. The sun gets 100 to 1,000 times brighter than normal in X-rays from the sunspot region. With that - we saw that, of course, in the time it takes light to get from the sun, so eight and a half minutes or so. HATHAWAY : Within an hour we saw radiation from it. This is energetic, subatomic particles, electrons and protons and so forth, and that built up pretty steadily and stayed high for days. That whole explosion, it's a magnetic explosion on the sun, launched what we called a coronal mass ejection. HATHAWAY : This is literally a billion tons of matter moving at a million miles an hour, streaming through the solar system, and it was aimed pretty much right at us. That hit us a couple days later and produced some spectacular auroral arrays. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And is it going on still? Is there still activity going on? HATHAWAY : Well, it's interesting you should ask. That one has since calmed down, but we are at this moment in the midst of an even bigger flare as far as X-rays, but it's off the edge of the sun, so we're not going to get the dramatic fireworks here on Earth from it. But we are at this moment in the midst of an X-ray flare that's even more powerful than the one from a few days ago. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. DOUG BIESECKER : Ira, in addition to that, I just want to point out that the radiation storm is - from that is also in progress. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So we called you at the right time. HATHAWAY : Indeed. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, we're going to - we have a whole bunch of time to talk about it. So 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're going to talk about this new solar flare that's happening as we speak and bigger than the one that happened earlier this week. You can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, and you can also go to our Facebook page and our website. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So we'll be back talking more about solar flares with David Hathaway and Doug Biesecker. Our number again, 1-800-989-8255. We're in the middle of a big one, and we'll talk about it some more. Stay with us. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about solar astronomy this hour with David Hathaway of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Doug Biesecker at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. Our number, 1-800-989-8255, and we called them up originally to talk about this week's earlier solar flare. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But we find out right now, as we speak, there's an even bigger one happening, although not the one that's pointed at us. It's not going to be hitting the Earth. Is that correct, Doug? DOUG BIESECKER : Right, so the active region, these regions of intense magnetic field that produce flares and give us the coronal mass ejections, the same region that gave us the activity earlier in the week has rotated in the five-day sense to where it's now seen at the edge of the sun. \n\n ###",

But even in spite of that, we see the direct X-rays and ultraviolet from the flare, and any radiation being accelerated by the coronal mass ejection can still make its way to Earth, and we're seeing both of those effects in progress. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And what effect would it have on Earth here? HATHAWAY : Well, the flare, the main effect is an atmospheric one. And the way you might be concerned about that \u2013 well, really, you probably wouldn't be - but if you're somebody who uses high-frequency radio to communicate \u2013 say, a ham operator, or you're in a ship at sea, or you're even in a plane flying, you know, across the Pacific Ocean right now, you'd find your high-frequency radio probably isn't working because of this solar flare. HATHAWAY : The way that works is the signal has to bounce off a layer in the atmosphere known as the ionosphere, and right now the ionosphere is very different from its normal state. And that bounce of the radio signal doesn't happen; it in fact gets absorbed by the atmosphere. DOUG BIESECKER : So HF users - high-frequency users in the Pacific right now are feeling the effects of this solar flare. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Were they warned about this one? DOUG BIESECKER : Well, predicting a solar flare would have happened today at 1:37 Eastern Time. We're not there yet. What we do is we look at these regions of intense magnetic field, the sun spots, how many of them are there, how complex is the magnetic field contained within, how big is it. DOUG BIESECKER : And from that we can compute our probability. So much like you might hear 40 percent chance of rain tomorrow, we can also say, you know, 60 percent chance of solar flares tomorrow. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So people in that area that you're saying, pilots, whatever, who are flying, they may be having trouble and not knowing why but probably predicting, uh-oh, another solar flare. DOUG BIESECKER : That's exactly right. But they have a workaround. As long as they can see those communication satellites that sit over the equator in geostationary orbit, 22,000 miles above the surface of the Earth, they can switch to that sat-com and still get the signal through. IRA FLATOW, HOST : David Hathaway, what is it on the sun that causes this thing to happen? What's going on in the internal workings of the sun? HATHAWAY : It's magnetism, pure and simple, that - it's magnetic fields involved in all of this. It's magnetic fields that make the sunspots themselves, that within the sun the flow of these ionized, electrically charged gases produces intense magnetic fields, and in some spots it gets to be, you know, thousands of times stronger than the Earth's own magnetic field, strong enough that in fact it chokes off the flow of heat from inside the sun, which is why sunspots appear dark. HATHAWAY : But those magnetic fields can get twisted out of shape and basically short-circuit by reconnecting, and all that magnetic energy gets released explosively. And so that's where it ultimately comes from, is magnetism ultimately produced inside the sun that we see manifest at the surface in sunspots and above the surface in coronal features, these loops where the gases in the sun's hot corona are confined, move along these magnetic loops above the surface. HATHAWAY : And so we can see the presence of the magnetic fields there. But it's - again, magnetism's the key to it all. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Speaking of magnetism, does our Earth's magnetic field that surrounds it, does it protect us from any of these things? HATHAWAY : Very much so, yeah, that the Earth's own magnetic field would normally look like a bar magnet's magnetic field, what we call a dipole field, going into the North, coming out of the South. But because it's also subjected to the solar wind that blows off of the sun at a million miles an hour, that solar wind drapes the Earth's magnetic field into a comet-like structure, a tail. HATHAWAY : So it pushes the magnetic field on the day side closer to the Earth, and it stretches it out on the night side into a long tail in back of the Earth. So that magnetic field does protect us from charged particles, but it's - it can also get disrupted by the magnetic fields in these coronal mass ejections that when this magnetic explosion goes off, the coronal mass ejection that's produced has magnetic field, is a key part of it, and that magnetic field, once it hits the Earth, if it's directed in the opposite way, if it's directed from north to south instead of south to north, it can produce reconnections in the Earth's magnetic field that ultimately lead to energetic particles, electrons and protons, streaming back along the Earth's magnetic field line into the atmosphere and producing the aurora. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow, that's terrific. Doug, did you want to jump in there? DOUG BIESECKER : Well, I was going to say in addition to the aurora, when the coronal mass ejection slams into the Earth's magnetic field, that magnetic field that does protect us from the radiation storm, that changing magnetic field causes problems for customers. DOUG BIESECKER : That's why the Space Weather Prediction Center is monitoring the sun 24 hours a day to provide forecasts and get out those official watches, warnings and alerts to customers, because when that coronal mass ejection hits the Earth, currents are being induced into the power grid. \n\n ###",

So it's something industry can respond to. They just need to have the watches, warnings and alerts to make sure they're able to. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, this one, if I heard you correctly, started less than an hour ago, and... DOUG BIESECKER : That's right, and... IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so you weren't really able to get out - your prediction is at what stage, compared to, let's say, weather forecasting? What stage are you at at predicting? DOUG BIESECKER : Well, I think the canonical thing people use is we're about 30 to 50 years behind weather forecasting. There are certain things where we're much better than that. With a coronal mass ejection we can observe them back at the sun, and then we can predict with in fact a numerical model that we introduced on the Weather Service supercomputer just a couple of months ago, we can use that to predict when this coronal mass ejection would arrive at Earth. DOUG BIESECKER : And the storm that erupted on Sunday, January 22, erupting at 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, slammed into the Earth at 10:00 a.m. Tuesday, within an hour of when it was predicted. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And the one that's predicted less than - it started an hour ago, when is that going to slam into the Earth? DOUG BIESECKER : Well, that's - the early indications are that, in fact, it won't. Because the active region has rotated away from an unfavorable position, that coronal mass ejection is going to fly harmlessly off into space, maybe hitting a science satellite or two on the way. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I think a lot of people don't realize that the sun actually rotates. DOUG BIESECKER : Yeah, the sun... IRA FLATOW, HOST : It spins on its own axis, yeah. DOUG BIESECKER : Every 27 days on average, and because of that rotation - and I'm going to give Dave the opportunity to jump in here and talk about why that's significant - lots of very - that's one of the reasons why the sun is so interesting, and we have a solar cycle. HATHAWAY : Yeah, part of it is that it - because it's a ball of gas, it doesn't have to rotate like a solid ball. In fact, it doesn't. At the equator, it rotates once in about 24 days. If you get near the poles, it takes about 35 days. And so that produces a sheering motion that things get stretched out and wrapped around the sun because of it, things like magnetic fields in particular, and that's in fact a key part of how the magnetic fields are generated and maintained within the sun, is - this is what we call differential rotation, the fact that the equator is rotating faster than the poles. HATHAWAY : There's a sheer layer near the surface that as you start at the surface and move inward, it - the rotation speeds up, then stays constant through, you know, 100,000 miles or so and then changes again at a layer about a quarter of the way into the sun. HATHAWAY : So that rotation, in fact, is key to producing the magnetic fields. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Virginia in Flint, Michigan. Hi, Virginia. VIRGINIA : Hi. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi there. VIRGINIA : Fascinating stuff. We've had really warm weather here in Michigan. Is this going to impact weather patterns, like, are we going to have a really hot summer now? Or another question is, is this going to melt the solar - excuse me - melt the icepacks and ozone and all that kind of stuff? I don't know if I've missed some of the answers already. But I'd be interested in how much it's going to melt, you know, the ice that's already melting so fast. IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK, Virginia, thanks for calling. We'll see what we can do. \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Uh-huh. HATHAWAY : Yeah. Those are great questions. The sun does influence climate to some respect, but probably not weather as far as the day-to-day, that even though the sun got 100 times brighter in X-rays, it hardly got brighter at all when you add up all the energy that the sun puts out and the Earth receives. That's a tiny amount, even over the course of a complete sunspot cycle, when you go from no sunspots to, you know, 100 sunspots on the sun and all of that activity; the sun's only about a 10th of percent, one part in 1,000 brighter. And so it's a small change. It has - again, in the long run has a bit of an effect on climate but day-to-day weather probably not. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Here's some questions, a few questions, different questions basically the same theme coming from the Internet, and people want to know how this would affect - a flare like this might affect people in space, either the space station or people - astronauts on their way to Mars or maybe on the moon, things like that. DOUG BIESECKER : Sure. Well, there certainly can be impacts. The astronauts on the International Space Station right now have to be concerned, but in general do they need to be concerned from the activity that's happening right now? Not really. Their action - they would react at very, very large levels of radiation. There's a certain risk that they're willing to accept, a few extra - or a slightly higher risk of cancer as they age. But the systems that they're using can be impacted by a radiation storm. DOUG BIESECKER : So you know, with the shuttle, for example, the robot arm couldn't be used when a radiation storm exceeded a certain level. So there are certain impacts they do have to be aware of. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Tell us about this huge solar storm of - the storm of 1859, Doug. DOUG BIESECKER : Well, 1859 was - it's kind of our perfect storm in solar physics. So the day was Thursday, September 1, and Sir Richard Carrington was in his house, at his observatory, watching the sun like he did every day, and he projected this image of the sun with his telescope till it was about 11 inches across. And each day he would draw the sunspots. And this particular day he'd finished drawing the sunspots and he was just about to start measuring the locations on the sun when all of a sudden two bright lights appeared in the middle of one of these magnetic regions he'd measured. DOUG BIESECKER : And he'd never seen this before. And he thought, oh, there's something wrong with my equipment, and he checked it out and quickly realized, no, it's not my equipment. And the careful observer that he is, he wrote down the time, 11:20 a.m. He was so shocked by this, he ran off to find somebody to help verify what he was seeing. He couldn't find anybody, came back, and it was already fading. It lasted all of five minutes. By 11:25 a.m., it was done. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let me just interrupt to say this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking with Doug Biesecker, spinning a yarn about the solar flare of 1859. Keep going. DOUG BIESECKER : So now he knew something special had happened. And what makes this really remarkable is at a magnetic observatory, again, when you shake the Earth's magnetic field, you know, if you and I had a compass, you know, it would point to solar north. But if you made a compass that was sensitive enough, you would be able to see that that magnetic field was shaking during one of these geomagnetic storms. And in fact, at 4:00 a.m. on September 2nd at the magnetic observatory at Kew Garden, there was a great magnetic storm. DOUG BIESECKER : And Carrington said, you know, a swallow doesn't make a summer, but there seems to be a connection here. So in just 17 hours after he saw a flare on the sun, we had a huge, in fact the largest ever recorded, magnetic storm on the surface of the Earth. It was so strong, every magnetic observatory in the world saturated, except for one that we know in India, and all measurements of that storm are now based on that one. Impacts... IRA FLATOW, HOST : And what did - yeah. What did it... DOUG BIESECKER : Right. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Telegraphs and things like that? DOUG BIESECKER : Right. So the technology of the day was telegraphs. So that's really where most of the impacts were. You know, in Pittsburgh the telegraph machines got so hot, the operators couldn't touch them. In Philadelphia, a telegraph operator received a shock from his equipment. In Boston, there was a flame of fire. You know, in telegraph stations up and down the East Coast the wood got scorched, paper burned. What did the average person see? Well, aurora. In Indianapolis the aurora was so bright and so strong, you didn't have to look north to see the aurora. DOUG BIESECKER : You could look at your southern horizon and still see the aurora. In Jamaica, it was described as like the light of a fire. It's believed that - well, in fact, it's been recorded that sailors saw it just 12 degrees north of the equator and that if weather conditions had been favorable it would have been seen even at the equator. So the entire globe was able to see the aurora on September 2, 1859. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. Do we know why that happened in such a spectacular fashion? What... DOUG BIESECKER : Well, this particular event was really just the extreme of exactly what happened just this past Sunday. Associated with that solar flare was one of these coronal mass ejections. The speed of the coronal mass ejection doesn't tell you exactly how strong the storm will be. That - for that you need to know the magnetic field in the CME, but it's a pretty good indicator. And that transit of 17 hours is the fastest ever recorded. And the impulse, you know, the amount of energy that got dumped into the Earth's magnetic field was just incredible. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Do we have a number you can put on even a solar flare that just happened this week, how big explosion goes on? \n\n ###",

I don't have a number. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dave, you got it? HATHAWAY : Yeah. DOUG BIESECKER : Yeah. HATHAWAY : The typical flare, if you look at the radiant energy from it, is the equivalent of a million megatons of TNT. So that's the energy equivalent of 10 million Hiroshima bombs. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. All right. We're going to let that sink in for a little bit, take a break. We'll come back more and talk with Doug Biesecker and David Hathaway about the sun and solar events. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us, @scifri. Stay with us. We'll be right back. IRA FLATOW, HOST : This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about solar flares and the sun with David Hathaway of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, and Doug Biesecker of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder. And we're going to talk a little - a few more minutes, because I want to recap. If you've just tuned in, there is a big solar flare happening right now in the sun, and maybe we can recap it. David, you want to take a shot at it? Or Doug? Who would like to tell us what's going on there now? HATHAWAY : Doug is probably better at that. He's on top of it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK. Doug, what... DOUG BIESECKER : Sure. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Bring us up to date. DOUG BIESECKER : Right. Well, I was on top of it until I walked into the studio, but what we had on a scale of one to five, we measure space weather, and the solar flare we had last Sunday we measured at two on our solar flare scale, or an R2. The flare we just had is even larger, at the R3 level. Within 20 minutes of that solar flare erupting, we started to see radiation particles at very high energies that are starting to hit the Earth. They - the Space Weather Prediction Center, in our role, of course, put out a warning as soon as the flare began and in fact put out warnings for the radiation storm before the particles even began to arrive. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And that happened today? DOUG BIESECKER : So that's happening right now. So the flare itself is probably practically over. HATHAWAY : Yeah. DOUG BIESECKER : The radiation storm will continue. It's hard for me to estimate without having seen the data recently how long that will continue. But what that would cause, you know, potential impacts to that - when the radiation levels reach sufficient levels, those same particles that David talked about coming down and hitting the polar regions, causing the aurora, that also causes the high frequency communications outages in the polar regions. And so any airplane flying over there loses their high-frequency radio. DOUG BIESECKER : The problem there is they can't see those satellite - communication satellites sitting over the equator, so in fact they have absolutely no way to communicate if they're in the polar regions during one of these storms, which is why it's important that they get the information as quickly as possible, because if they have to divert one of those routes, it's not very cost effective. IRA FLATOW, HOST : David, you want to add anything? HATHAWAY : No. It's just - I wanted to mention, I am in my office so I can see the data, and the X-rays are well on their way going down, but the energetic particles, protons in particular, are rising rapidly.

I'm Jennifer Ludden in Washington. Neal Conan is away. The Great Recession forced many families to tighten their belts: cutting off the cable, cutting back on groceries, eating out less. But more and more Americans are making even bigger changes, pooling resources by moving in with relatives. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And while the downturn has accelerated this growth in multigenerational households, the trend actually started long before the economy turned south. Joining me now is a member of one such family. Christopher Collings lives in Hacienda Heights, California, and he's with us now by phone from Brea, California. Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Hello Jennifer, glad you could have me on, thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So tell us, who lives in your house? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : It's myself, my wife, we have three daughters, we have a fourth child on the way, and we have mother- and father-in-law, my wife's parents there, as well as occasionally, about two or three weekends a month, my brother- and sister-in-law come down from Bakersfield, California, with their two kids, and my other brother-in-law, who is living in New York, where he models, he usually stays with us maybe a grand total about a month out of each year, usually a few days here and a few days there. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : That's a bustling house. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : It is, yes indeed. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And why did you and your wife decide to move in with her parents? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Well, it was a couple different things. We had already had a home of our own about 20 miles away, and my mother- and father-in-law had recently purchased a newer home here in Hacienda Heights and were selling theirs. It's quite a large home and we thought, you know, my wife at the time was driving 20 or 30 miles. It was a longer commute, and it just made sense to us for several different reasons, both economics of being able to just share the costs of a single household plus probably more importantly for me was that I come from a small military family, and we traveled the world, but there was never a lot of family around when I was growing up. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : And once I met and married my wife, I sort of latched on to her extended family, which I always thought was a boon to be able to have a lot of relatives and family get-togethers that I missed growing up. So the idea of being able to have grandparents, my kids' grandparents, living with us was perfectly acceptable for me, and I thought it was just a wonderful idea. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And that was OK with the grandparents, too? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : They've certainly enjoyed it. You know, having children around, especially three and a fourth on the way, all the time makes the household a lot louder and a lot messier, but, you know, children also bring a lot of life to a household. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : You know, if my mother- and father-in-law, who are in their late 50s now, were living in a home on their own, probably it would be a lot quieter and a lot more empty, though. And they certainly - in fact they just returned from a trip to Taiwan, their native land of birth, and the first thing they said when I picked them up at the airport is how much they missed the grandkids, and they can't wait to see the grandkids, and it's all about the grandkids. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Aw. Now it's obviously working well for you, but were there some adjustments? Were there some challenges there at the beginning? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Oh, certainly, and maybe also I should let you know that I'm a normal, white Caucasian American. My wife is Taiwanese descent, and her family are also Taiwanese. So I am the only Caucasian amongst a sea of Asian faces. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So some cultural differences to figure out there. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : There were indeed, yes. So it's not just generational but cultural. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Like what? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : But, you know, the thing is I think the main point was that we were - our objective was that we love each other, it's a family, and we just make an effort to work through any difficulties. There would be difficulties both because you have - you know, I liken it to the fact that whether you're living with anyone, whether it's a college roommate or like when I was in the military, people I would dorm with or even when you first marry someone and you spend time, there's always a serious amount of adjustment and compromise when you live with somebody who has their own way of doing things and seeing things. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : And we certainly had our fair share of that, but in the end, it was a matter of working through those things and just realizing that, you know, two good words are I'm sorry and trying to find the compromises. So I think in the end, we've been doing it now for nine years, and we just have a lot stronger relationship for it, and pretty much after the first two or three years, it became a lot easier - smoother sailing I should say. \n\n ###",

CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Well, my relationship with my mother- and father-in-law, I just call them mom and dad, is certainly stronger. They treat me like their son. And my wife and I, our relationship obviously is great. There were some difficulties, you know, that even stressed our relationship a little bit, but, you know, we just have a lot of love for each other and grace, and I think it just, you know, worked itself out. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : I - honestly, there wasn't - there's no one great point of drama that I could point out. There was no fighting and yelling and screaming. It's more little things like, you know, the porch light left on because my father-in-law gets up early, and we don't. And so he comes in, and, you know, he wants to turn off the porch light because it's on at 8 o'clock in the morning when it's bright sunlight. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : I know it seems little, but, you know, it's little things like that that we just have to be able to just work things out and accept that we see things a little bit differently, and we work to compromise to make everything run smoothly, and the same for them, too. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And any tips? I mean, is there like a monthly meeting or a list of ground rules? Any tips for how to make it work? CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Yeah, I mean, I'm not a particular list person, and I think that if you try to set objectives like monthly meetings, it would probably go out the door by the second or third month just because it's life. And I think the main thing is to communicate. My in-laws would have a - whenever they had a point of conflict, they would often keep it within themselves and expect me to just know what that might be, and that certainly wasn't the case. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : And once we were able to just communicate those things, and they could see that we were making efforts to accommodate them and vice versa, I think that was the real way. So if I had to make any recommendations, it would just be to communicate and to realize you're really on the same team. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : I mean, living together provides - not only is there economic benefits there, but there's security and there's fellowship, companionship. You know, the house is never really empty. There's - you know, if anybody's injured, or even just as a simple as, you know, oh, the car's having problems, you don't have to worry about the logistics of going to someone's house and picking them up. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : It's all those little things, and I think we sort of miss that in today's life with - you know, we don't know even who our neighbors are most of the time. So I've really enjoyed the opportunities of being able to have a nice big household filled with people, and I have no problem when the four people, my brother- and sister-in-law come down from Bakersfield, and they spend the weekend. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : And the kids get along great, and certainly the children love having their grandparents handy, and the grandparents love having the children. I should also mention my mother-in-law still works. So she's not the typical, around all the time with the grandkids. She actually runs her own business and, you know, would like to eventually be able to spend more time with the grandkids. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, well Christopher Collings, thank you so much for sharing, and thanks for your time. CHRISTOPHER COLLINGS : Certainly, Jennifer. You have a good day.

Or you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Later in the program, we'll talk to crime writer Walter Mosley about his latest Leonid McGill mystery. But first, Katherine Newman joins us. She's the author of \"The Accordion Family: Boomerang Kids, Anxious Parents and the Private Toll of Competition.\" She joins us from our New York bureau. Welcome. KATHERINE NEWMAN : Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So, many people think of this multigenerational household as a new phenomenon with this recession, but it's not really. Is that right? KATHERINE NEWMAN : We had lots of multigenerational households, especially before the second World War and the huge influx of women into the labor market. It was absolutely commonplace for older people to move in with their children before we had nursing homes and when we took responsibility for caring across that generational boundary. KATHERINE NEWMAN : What I think is new, relatively new, is young people moving in with their parents in order to shelter from the economic stresses that did predate the recession, that actually do go back all the way to the restructurings of the 1980s, and to the elongating period of time when young people need to get more education in order to qualify for professional careers. KATHERINE NEWMAN : So what's new is the phenomenon of people in their 20s and early 30s either boomeranging back into their parents' households, or in many countries other than the United States never leaving in the first place. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And you mentioned the restructuring of the 1980s that kind of started driving this. What do you mean? \n\n ###",

We had a period of sort of neoliberal reforms in the labor markets around the world where people who were used to having long-term jobs suddenly found themselves with short-term contracts and part-time work. KATHERINE NEWMAN : That's a kind of new phenomenon of what we sometimes call contingent work, which really made a powerful appearance in labor markets all over Western Europe and Japan and the United States in the early 1980s and has stuck with us ever since. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So this multigenerational household, it's not just an American thing that's happening now? KATHERINE NEWMAN : Oh, not at all. In fact, it's even more pronounced in countries like Italy, Spain, Japan. We're really in the middle. We're not on the extreme end. And we're in the middle in how we feel about it, too, because this phenomenon provokes some very extreme and negative reactions in some countries, and in others, it's, well, what's the problem, why me worry, why did they ever want to leave me anyway, which seems to be the typical reaction in the Italian families that we interviewed for my book. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So what, though, what does it mean? So we have 20-somethings moving back in in large numbers with mom and dad. You know, are they doing this - you mentioned economic reasons but also people are getting married later and later. Are they moving back home because they're not planning on getting married or does moving back home make it more likely that they're not going to get married until much later? KATHERINE NEWMAN : Well, there are a whole bunch of chickens and eggs in your statement, and they're all right, of course. There are economic drivers to the phenomenon I call accordion families. It has become much more difficult for young people to find their footing in the economy. That did precede the recession, but it certainly got worse during this recession. KATHERINE NEWMAN : It takes much longer to complete an education at a level that will qualify you for a professional career, so that's expensive, and you can shelter some of those costs by moving in to the inn of mom and dad. KATHERINE NEWMAN : So there are a lot of economic reasons that have particularly been at work in the lives of younger people entering the labor market. But there are cultural expectations, too. You know, when I was a kid, in my teens, there was a lot of cultural support for living pretty cheap and wearing blue jeans with holes in them, and you didn't care very much whether you lived in a pleasant place. KATHERINE NEWMAN : I think that that was an aberration, that sort of countercultural era. Now I think there's more of a desire for creature comforts but not the capacity to pay for them. So if young people move back in with mom and dad, they might be able to afford a nicer car, they might live in greater comfort than they could afford to pay for on their own. KATHERINE NEWMAN : They may need to save money for the master's degree they'd like to acquire or their experience as an intern where no one's paying them at all in order to get to where they want to go ultimately as professionals. KATHERINE NEWMAN : So all of those things, which are a combination of economic factors and cultural tastes, or generational tastes, play a role in pushing the creation of accordion families. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, and we're going to hear some stories from our listeners after the break. We're talking about households with multiple generations under the same roof. Call us if this is your story, 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. I'm Jennifer Ludden. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden. Moving in with your kids or your parents appears to be a financial lifeline for many people, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center. Adjusted incomes for those families are lower overall, but the poverty rate among people in multigenerational households is significantly lower than in others. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : The economy is just one part of this trend of more extended families living under the same roof. If this is your story, as a member of a multigenerational household, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is npr.org, and you can join the conversation at our website.

She wrote the book \"The Accordion Family: Boomerang Kids, Anxious Parents and the Private Toll of Global Competition.\" And we also have some folks on the line. Amy's(ph) in Sacramento, welcome. AMY : Hi, thank you for taking my call. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Go right ahead. AMY : Oh, OK, well, we - I'm 37, I live with my parents still. No, I know it sounds funny but, you know, it was a decision we made together in '04. My husband and I had lived on our own right outside of Sacramento in Folsom. And my parents, who lived in my grandparents' house, built in the '80s, had - wanted to move, wanted to downsize because it's a house with a mother-in-law quarters in the back, where my grandparents were living. AMY : And, you know, we didn't - the kids, us, we didn't want them to sell the house, and we couldn't afford to purchase it for what they needed to move on, and my parents asked us up one weekend, and we had a discussion about selling our own in Folsom, refinancing to add on. And we agreed. AMY : And my husband's a carpenter. My dad's very handy, and we came up, and we made it one dwelling, and it's two homes basically attached as one dwelling. And so I live there with my grandfather, my parents and now my two kids. \n\n ###",

AMY : Yes. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Your grandparents are still alive. AMY : Yes. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Wow. AMY : My grandmother had passed away a few years back, but... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : I see. And what challenges have come up? AMY : Well, you know, moving in as - you know, I moved in with my parents. So my husband got to move in with his in-laws. And I was working out of the home as a real estate appraiser. My mother was working and she retired, and she ended up working in the home. And the transition from being the child to having my own kids and then living with my mother, who used to, you know, raise me as a child, having to find it's not quite that boundary, but, you know, creating my own boundaries as a mother and becoming my mother's friend and being somebody to work together in a relationship different than the daughter. AMY : You know, and so setting those parameters, and luckily my mother, you know, she's a very easy person to communicate with. There was a few fights because we were - she did end up working with me, and she wanted to change my daughter's bedroom, and she had - she is very strong, A-personality like myself, and we had to have those sit-down conversations of, OK, this is where I'm at, this is what you expect. AMY : But, you know, I'm also a mother, and I want to rear my children. And having - you know, I heard somebody, a previous caller talking about how it actually strengthened their relationship, and we're finding that, too, but it takes willing parties, I'm noticing. It takes... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And a lot of communication. AMY : Yeah, and, you know, there was a few times where my mom threw her hands up and said you know what? I can't do this. I think we need to split up. There was only - it was two times in two years in a row, and the first year, I said, you know, mom, I think this is a relationship just like my husband and I. We have to work on it also. We have to work towards solutions. AMY : And then the next year, we were going through it, and I threw my hands up and said you know, this is just too much. It's too much information. We have to work with, you know, five people instead of just me and my husband. And she said, you know, honey, this is a relationship. She said that back to me. AMY : And I put my hands down and said you're correct. You know, I have enjoyed my parents more now. And - but it takes people that are willing to work hard, that are willing to look towards the common goal. You know, when we refinanced the house, you know, it's to benefit all of us. As someone else said, you know, when a car does break down, we don't - we don't abuse each other, as well. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Well, Amy, thank you so much, appreciate your call. Katherine Newman, a lot of issues at play there, financial among others. KATHERINE NEWMAN : Well, I think the thing we need to understand is that when young people, or even not so young people, move back in with their families, they're not the same person who was there when they were a teenager. And the role relationships aren't the same, either. KATHERINE NEWMAN : What I found on the whole was that it did make things more positive. This is particularly true when we look at people who are in their mid-20s who aren't married yet and don't have their own children moving in with their parents. They come back as young adults, and the parents no longer have the kind of surveillance obligations, you know, is Sally home by midnight, what's she doing with her boyfriend? KATHERINE NEWMAN : They sort of lose those anxieties around their homework or where are they going to go to college. All the many things that makes parenting stressful tend to sort of recede into the background, and what comes into the fore is something closer to an egalitarian friendship. KATHERINE NEWMAN : That can be difficult to negotiate, but it also has many positives associated with it. The other thing that happens is that those parents become, or remain, sociologically younger. They're not any biologically younger, but their roles remain as active parents. And if you define your identity by that activity, then you're not really moving on into that sunset year of the empty nest and the grandparent life. You're really the same person you were when you had your kids in the first place. You're an active parent. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So it's keeping you young. \n\n ###",

So there are many silver linings to all of this. The problems crop up when there are either conflicts over who's doing what and who has what sort of authority. And for the younger person who doesn't appear to be making moves toward that adult metamorphosis. That does generate trouble. KATHERINE NEWMAN : If Johnny's in the basement playing video games, it's very different than Johnny's earning a master's degree... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Or saving for a mortgage or something like that. KATHERINE NEWMAN : Exactly. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Let's take another phone call. Jennifer in Oahu, hi there. JENNIFER : Hi, I was just calling because we also live in a multigenerational home. My - I have a son who has special needs, and I guess our biggest problem is trying to define each person's role, like grandparent and parent. You know, grandma just wants to be grandma and doesn't really want to discipline, but when they live next door, like how we are, we live on the same property, you know, it's hard that he goes whenever he feels like he can escape from mom's discipline and run over to grandma's to a rescue. JENNIFER : But we just - we have a lot to deal with, like, you know, drawing the line of, you know, what she can allow him to do and not allow him to do. She wants to give him the world, but, you know, you can't spoil him that way because he sees them so much, it's kind of a different relationship. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : That's right. She can't do the spoiling all the time if she's there all the time. Interesting. JENNIFER : Exactly. So we've actually gone through therapy. JENNIFER : I know that sounds so - I mean, no, it's good. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : A new field for psychotherapists. JENNIFER : We, we - yeah, somebody actually had to come in and kind of like talk to all of us, and just, you know, we cherish them enough that we wanted it to work. You know, we've got a really good setup where, you know, my son has every playground equipment and therapist you can think of, and they help us with a lot of that stuff. But it's just hard when, you know, he wants to do something like put his feet on people's ears, and she thinks it's the cutest thing in the world, and I'm trying my hardest to stop that. JENNIFER : My son has autism, so he does lots of quirky things that grandma thinks are cute and mommy's trying to stop, you know. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Right. JENNIFER : We've had to kind of set like a rule as far as like after 8 o'clock, you can go over there until bedtime, and I won't be monitoring what you're doing. But if you're outside, and you get to play with grandma, then she needs to follow by mommy's rules. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, well, Jennifer, thank you so much for calling and good luck with making it all work. JENNIFER : Thanks, bye-bye. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Katherine Newman, we're going to let you go, but before we do, can you give us any kind of strategies to help make this work? You've interviewed so many families for your book. Were there tips that stood out? KATHERINE NEWMAN : I think the kind of honesty of communication that your callers have expressed is really quite crucial. Trying to explain what your expectations are, how long is this relationship going to last this way, that is how long are we all going to be living together? Is this a permanent arrangement? Is this temporary? KATHERINE NEWMAN : Are we there to help one another achieve some goal? And what are the benchmarks in moving toward those goals? Like any other relationship, a certain degree of honesty and disclosure certainly helps, but I think that many of the reasons why these relationships work among your callers is that they've got older in the family that are still active, they're still healthy. \n\n ###",

How are those obligations going to be sorted out? What are the financial obligations of the people in the household? Do you expect your children to pay rent or to contribute to the mortgage? KATHERINE NEWMAN : In the Italian families I interviewed, those kids were helping to pay off that family mortgage. So who does that house belong to? Will that help them someday with some sort of asserts? Straightforward disclosure certainly helps. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, I actually maybe said goodbye a bit too early there. I think you can - if you can stay with us, that would be great. KATHERINE NEWMAN : I'm happy to. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : But we're going to be joined, as well, by Greg McGuff. He's a division president for Southern California - in Southern California for Lennar Homes. The company saw this trend toward more family members living under the same roof as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market. Greg McGuff is with us now by phone from his office in Corona, California. Welcome to you. GREG MCGUFF : Hi, Jennifer. Thank you very much for having us. And I love the intro - an otherwise gloomy market. GREG MCGUFF : It is exciting to be doing something exciting in today's housing market. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So what do you see out there? What's this market? GREG MCGUFF : Well, you know, what we see on the multigenerational front is really a market where, you know, you see one in five households currently living multigenerationally, yet you didn't really see a new home building or new housing providing homes for those buyers. GREG MCGUFF : So what we're starting to see, as we brought on what we call our next gen product, the Home Within a Home, is we're starting to see a change in our buyer profile coming to our communities. And we're starting to see the demographics that are so strong, relative to the baby boomers, relative to the boomerang children, and just relative to people who are looking for a different, more flexible way to live... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And does that include a lot of immigrant families? Hispanics and Asians much more likely to live like this. Is that right? GREG MCGUFF : Absolutely. I mean, that's what the demographics tell you, although right now, honestly, we've had, you know, a cross coverage of all the ethnicities - Caucasian, Hispanic, Filipino, Asian - and all for a different reason. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So tell me about your next gen home. What's it like? GREG MCGUFF : Well, the next gen home, it looks like a typical single-family home, you know, that could be 50-foot wide. It's a 3,000 square foot home. But approximately 500 square feet are dedicated to what we call the Home Within a Home. So it has its separate entranceway, which really gives a lot of independence to the person living in the next gen suite. They have their own living room with a kitchenette, so they'll have a refrigerator, a convection microwave oven, a sink. They'll also have their own laundry area, their own bathroom, one or two bedrooms. GREG MCGUFF : And what's also important is to kind of give a dedicated outdoor space so that they can have also an outdoor and indoor living, and it connects to the main home. So what it offers somebody is the flexibility of living independently, but also to be able to interface because these are families that are living together. And it avoids some of the conflicts we heard with, you know, some of your previous callers relative to porch lights being left on and how you operate within the space. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And who's buying these homes? GREG MCGUFF : You know, people are buying it for a lot of different reasons. You certainly have a lot of people who are buying them now and seeing the flexibility in it, that maybe their sister lost their home, and they're going to live with them for two years. And their parents, you know, they're looking ahead and saying, my parents two years from now aren't going to be in a position where they can live on their own. And you see people who are now in a position where their mother is living alone, and they want to live with their mother. And you see their college children coming back into the home. GREG MCGUFF : And you also see people buying it because in California you have a lot of people visiting the state from other parts of the country, or you have people coming over from Asia and have extended stays, and they look at it and say, this is fantastic. My mother-in-law comes for, her parents come for, you know, a month or two months, and they now have their own private space that they can live in and interface with us in a familial way. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Let me just say here, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let's take another caller. Mark is in Detroit, Michigan. Welcome, Mark.

MARK : OK. We were looking for, basically, what the - your new guest is describing. We were looking for a house with the - with an in-law suite because we were trying to maintain - my wife and I were trying to maintain a house, plus help out her dad, who lives close by. And he is, you know, he is about 80 now, and we wanted, you know, something suitable for all of us. And the - we couldn't afford it ourselves, but by selling our house and selling his house, we were able to buy it. We actually - or it's like a partnership. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And you suggested that or he did? MARK : Well, initially, it was my suggestion, but, you know, we all got together on it and bought the house together. And it's - now we don't - we didn't find one with an in-law suite, unfortunately. And so the real issue, for us, has been, you know, space, you know? But it's hard to not be in each other's face all the time. The in-law suite, I think, is just a must. But, you know, you can't always, you know, you can't always that pull it off, so... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, so... MARK : ...at least in our area because those houses are few and far between. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So there's more market out there that needs to be served. How do you manage the tight space with everyone? MARK : Well, it's precarious. You know, there are times when - just for me because he's not my father. You know, there's pros and cons having him there, but that's what I have to do for myself. I have to think, OK, what are the pros again? I think I remind myself often what the pros are. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Well, Mark, thanks for calling. MARK : Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So, Katherine Newman, privacy is a big issue in these arrangements. KATHERINE NEWMAN : Yes, it is especially interesting when you talk to people who are, again, in their mid-20s, who would like to be able to have romantic relationships. How do they do that in the context of their parents' home? You know, all the people who've been calling you have fully-formed partnerships. They're married. They have kids. So they're past through all of those awkward stages of trying to find their life partners. KATHERINE NEWMAN : But when we look at younger people who are boomeranging back into their parents' house, it's a little bit more complicated 'cause in order to navigate that emotional terrain out there, it's difficult to do that if you're inside your parents' home. Even so, I find that baby boom parents are fairly comfortable with a slightly more liberated sense of privacy or sexual behavior for their kids. They're not so uptight about whether or not they bring a boyfriend or a girlfriend home. After all, they were the generation themselves that broke most of those barriers to begin with. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : That's right. KATHERINE NEWMAN : So it would be odd for them to stand on a high horse with this. But it is still difficult for that young person to find their way when the economy is not really making it possible for them to do that autonomously. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Right. We have just a moment left, but, Greg McGuff, are you concerned that once the economy rebounds maybe demand for this kind of home might fall off? GREG MCGUFF : No. We firmly believe that this has staying power. You know, when you look at the flexibility, and because it allows for some of that privacy and independency that the Katherine is referring to, we really believe it will continue. Also, if you just look at the change in ethnicities and the greater increase of, you know, Asian, Hispanic homeowners within our country, and it's also a way, you know, to curb urban sprawl. GREG MCGUFF : So if you're caring for your mother, you don't have to drive five minutes to take her to get her haircut or to take her to (unintelligible) housing. And I also think, with the economy, it isn't going to change the fact that 350,000 Americans are turning age 65 each month in this country. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Greg McGuff, division president for Lennar Homes in Southern California, thank you so much. GREG MCGUFF : Thank you. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Over the weekend, it became clear that the crisis in Syria has entered a dangerous new phase. The presence of monitors from the Arab League failed to restore calm. As violence continues, monitors withdrew on Saturday. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Armed opposition to the government of Bashar al-Assad continues to mount, and in just the past few days, clashes were reported in Damascus and in Aleppo, the two largest cities in the country, which had been mostly quiet. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The Syrian government rejects an Arab League proposal for the president to step down to make way for negotiations on elections, and Russia appears ready to oppose further measures at the United Nations Security Council. So what's next? What do you think the United States should do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, Freddie Mac's conflict of interest on refinancing mortgages. But first Syria. NPR foreign correspondent Kelly McEvers, joins us from Beirut, and Kelly, as always, thanks very much for being with us. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : You're welcome. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what is the latest, especially from Damascus? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : What we're hearing from activists and witnesses inside Syria is that government troops are launching a major offensive in a series of suburbs outside the capital. Government troops are going in with heavy arms and shelling residential areas largely to sort of take back some of the towns that rebels had claimed to control over the weekend. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Now, when they say they controlled these places, they basically had set up checkpoints to protect unarmed protestors in these towns, protestors who are against the government. But now the government troops are coming back in and saying no, you actually don't hold these towns, we do. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we apologize for the slight delay. that's caused by the satellite telephone. But it brings Kelly McEvers to us in high quality. In the meantime, as this conflict continues to spread, is there any doubt any longer that this is on the verge of civil war if not open civil war? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : It's looking more and more like the latter, Neal. You know, it's - for months and months, this was an uprising. This was largely by, you know, unarmed protestors in cities and towns across the country calling for the downfall of this regime. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Over the summer, what we saw were, you know, small numbers of soldiers defecting from the army, taking their guns off of the base and saying they wanted to protect protestors, again like they've been saying in these suburbs. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : But what we're seeing now are just open clashes between these anti-government rebels and pro-government forces. And what we're hearing in the last 24 hours is that the defections are increasing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It had been, also, until very recently, a provincial conflict: mostly in the countryside, mostly in smaller cities. What does it mean now that there has been fighting in and around Damascus and Aleppo? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : What it means is that the regime's narrative - that they have everything under control and that, you know, yes this is largely a concern of folks in the rural areas, this doesn't really concern you people here in Damascus and in Syria's second city, Aleppo - that that narrative is really kind of unraveling. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : That the rebels were even able to get that close and, you know, even if they were just manning some checkpoints for a short period of time, that they were able to do that sends a really strong message to the people inside Syria, to the so-called, you know, silent majority that's been kind of sitting on the fence waiting to see where this is going to go. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : I think now there's a sense that there is a tip - now, does that mean that the regime is on the verge of falling? No. Why? Because the army is still more powerful than this very ragtag rebel group. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And where does this leave diplomacy with the withdrawal of Arab League monitors? The Arab League says it will take its proposal to the United Nations Security Council. But as we noticed, Russia and perhaps China, as well, seem to be ready to oppose it. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : That Arab League initiative does call for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to, you know, eventually abdicate power. It's not an open call for, you know, regime change. It's slightly more diplomatic, let's say, than that. And so by - but by doing that, you know, Russia has said that that's just too much. Even though this new resolution does not call for new sanctions, does not call for any kind of international intervention into Syria, they still say that this notion that somebody else, that outsiders would, you know, would decide when a president should step down, that that's too much for them. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : That's what they're saying publicly. They have indicated that they are willing to negotiate, and we'll see tomorrow, when the U.N. Security Council meets. Russia kind of came up with its own proposal today, saying that - you know, inviting elements from the Syrian regime and the opposition to Moscow for talks. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : The regime, of course, immediately agreed. The opposition, of course, immediately refused, saying there's no way they will hold talks with a regime that is responsible for so much killing. \n\n ###",

We hear more and more of the people in Syria at these demonstrations saying please protect us. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Sure, you know, every - you know, all the way back to the summer, we had, you know, Friday protests. Every time they protest on Friday, they have a title, and one of them was even called No Fly Zone Friday. So it - that's - you've seen that going all the way back several months. But this is still a very fiercely debated topic inside Syria and inside the Syrian opposition. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : I mean, it's the one thing that divides the opposition probably more than anything else. So while we have seen calls from the inside for some kind of help, some kind of intervention, it's not unanimous by any means. I think they're - the Syrian people by and large are very wary of such a move. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from our listeners today. What should the United States do? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. We'll start with Matt(ph), and Matt's on the line with us from San Jose. MATT : Hi, I'm calling about the Christian minority in Syria that's protected by the Assad government. We've seen in Egypt and in Iraq that once the government falls, the government is no more, the Islamists start attacking the Christians. In fact, it's even starting in Syria. MATT : Just on Friday, a priest named Bassilius was shot in the chest while he was taking care of wounded people at one of the demonstrations, shot by the demonstrating side or the rebel side. I'm not saying that Assad's good, he's a horrible tyrant, but at least he's maintaining order or has been maintaining order, I mean, has been keeping people from killing the Christians. MATT : So that's all I wanted to say is that I think we ought to stay out of it and let Assad reassert himself and re-establish order. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Kelly McEvers, the United States has said that President Assad should step aside. It has not taken steps to do that other than sanctions thus far. But what about Matt's point that Christians seem to be being protected by the regime and might be at risk if that regime should fall? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : It's a hugely important point. While I cannot confirm this particular incident that he's talking about, access to journalists is very restricted these days, it is an extremely important point for all minorities, not just Christians. Actually, the Assad regime is in the minority itself. The Assad regime comes from the Alawite sect, which is very much in the minority in Syria. So all other Alawites in Syria are very worried about what would happen should this regime fall. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : We saw what happened in Iraq when the strong man goes. We've now seen what happened in other places when the strong man goes. Who's there to sort of hold the place together? And it's not just about Islamists, it's about minority groups finally having a chance to have their say and all of a sudden thinking that maybe one way to have their say is through violence when there is no order at the top. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : The Christian minority in Syria, therefore, has been very silent throughout all of this and very much on the side of Assad through all of this. But again, as the country begins to unravel, and as the instability spreads, I mean, as people don't have power anymore, as the currency starts to plummet, as it has, they start to wonder is this is the guy who can hold the place together. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : And I think that's the issue. You know, while America can call for Assad to step down, I think this is exactly what's making the U.S. and the rest of its allies very wary of any kind of intervention, it's this very scenario. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Matt, thanks very much for the call. Joining us now is Wissam Tarif, Arab world campaigner with Avaaz, and he's with us from his home in Lebanon. Nice to have you with us today. WISSAM TARIF : Thank you, thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what do Syrians tell you that they want? WISSAM TARIF : Syrians want to live in dignity. They want basic human rights, and they want freedom. They want very much what people in democratic countries, in the U.S., people take for granted. We're talking about a regime that for 40 years has oppressed its people. WISSAM TARIF : There's no - there was no freedom of expression. People were put in jail very easily. There have been systematic torture. There have been killings, shooting on peaceful protestors. What's happening in Syria at this stage, we have to take it to its root, to its origin. WISSAM TARIF : This is an uprising of the people in Syria against a dictator, against a totalitarian regime. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And to - to remove that dictator, as you describe him, do Syrians want the outside world to help? And if so, how? WISSAM TARIF : Well, Syria is in a very strategic location. We have to keep in mind that the Syrian regime and the U.S. had a deep problem during the Bush era while the Syrian regime was accused, repeatedly, even by Obama administration, in the early stage, of sending insurgents to Iraq. \n\n ###",

The Syrian regime has chosen in the past, when it was convenient, for the regime to play the role of the stabilizer. WISSAM TARIF : That's why the international community have constantly embraced this man and this regime. Now the game has changed. This man is not an element of stabilization in the region. This man is a dictator who has been killing his own people. Therefore, yes, we have heard lots of voices coming from inside Syria. WISSAM TARIF : The National Council has called for military intervention very similar to the Libyan scenario. Of course, this is a very difficult topic, and there have been different views coming from inside Syria. But as the oppression and the military campaign and the crackdown expands, also the demand for a buffer zone or for a no-fly zone is getting bigger and louder during the protests from the people in the streets. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A couple of differences with the situation in Libya. For one, many more people have died in Lebanon, thus far, 5,400 according to the United Nations. Thus far there are no areas held by rebel forces inside Syria, as there were in Libya, for an organization to form a provisional government. So that's a big difference, as well. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking about the ongoing crisis in Syria. What should the U.S. do next? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. Activists report heavy shelling rained over homes today, though Syria's official news agency has been silent on those reports. It said that a gas pipeline in that area was blown up by an unidentified terrorist group. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Syrian forces attempted to push back dissidents from suburbs outside Damascus in an effort to regain control of the eastern side of the city. It's unclear that they've been successful. The intensified assault from President Bashar al-Assad's regime comes just a day before the U.N. Security Council takes up a resolution that would demand that President Assad adhere to an Arab League peace plan to make a transition to power to a vice president and permit the creation of a unity government. NEAL CONAN, HOST : NPR foreign correspondent Kelly McEvers is with us from Beirut. Human rights activist, Wissam Tarif, Arab world campaigner with Avaaz, is also with us from Lebanon. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Callers, we want to hear from you. What should the United States do next? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Let's go next to Drew(ph), Drew's on the line in Cincinnati. DREW : Hey there. Well, I would just like to say that while I agree it's great to push economic sanctions, I think that the world community should really limit it to that, because if we look at Afghanistan, you know, we removed, you know, dictators, but you have the Taliban. And, you know, we went so far as to even put boots on the ground. DREW : Now if we were to do that in Syria, you know, well, Afghanistan is still quite unstable, and they're still fighting. So I guess it really shows that it's ultimately up to the people to take care of their - you know, take care of their country and their government and really make their steps to decide what they want as a people. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Drew, I guess the question would have to be: Given the fact that the army remains loyal to the regime, we could see thousands of people, thousands more people, killed. DREW : Yes sir, yes sir. I mean, it's quite unfortunate, but at the same time, do we want those people to be killed, both Syrian civilians and international troops? Or do we just, you know, try and hold out with economic sanctions and eventually try and find a, you know, a diplomatic end to it? NEAL CONAN, HOST : A couple of question there. Kelly McEvers, is there any indication that economic sanctions can be persuasive? We know they're having an effect. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Yes, definitely. Like I mentioned before, I mean, the currency is not doing well. The prices of basic goods and services are going up, you know, heating oil, things that people need this winter. It's getting cold. So I think that, you know, this silent majority that we're talking about is feeling the squeeze of the sanctions. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : And this is exactly what the aim of the sanctions are, right, is to sort of convince the people that the government doesn't, you know, have the strength to hold the place together, and then maybe they'll turn against the government themselves. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : However, I think it's - you know, it's a little bit dangerous. I think, earlier on, you saw a lot of American diplomats who just sort of assumed that this would just take care of itself, you know, that eventually this regime would fall. And I think we're seeing that this regime is very resilient and is not willing to just sort of capitulate. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : So, you know, I think diplomacy is an important tool in the toolbox, as well, and I think we're going to see that, at least that debate begin at the U.N. Security Council tomorrow. I'm not necessarily certain that there will be some unanimous vote, where you've got, you know, a chorus of unanimous voices in the international community in agreement, but it... NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we seem to have just lost the satellite telephone linkage to Kelly McEvers in Beirut. We're going to try to get that back. In the meantime, we'll got to Wissam Tarif, and you spoke just a few moments ago about the creation of buffer zones. They would have to be protected presumably by outside troops. Would they be a positive force, or could they make the situation worse, as our caller suggested? WISSAM TARIF : Well, we have to keep in mind that the Russians have been blocking any resolution coming from the Security Council. The Russians still hold three nos, no for sanctions, no for arm embargo and no for ICC referral. I think it would be only fair to refer this regime, al-Assad, and the regime components to the international criminal courts. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### WISSAM TARIF : Nevertheless, the Russians are not going to allow that tomorrow. What is possible and what is doable, the Arab League have made an initiative or a peace initiative in which they have suggested that al-Assad pass power to his vice president, to Farouk al-Sharaa. WISSAM TARIF : I think that if the United States and the main allies - which is Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with the United States - put enough pressure on Russia, then Russia, because the Russians have been talking continuously about a political solution, well, this is a political solution. If al-Assad surrenders power to the vice president and leaves the country, then that might be the beginning of a political solution, like... But the big question is : Would Russia allow that? And if the Russians get engaged in this process, the big question, would al-Assad accept this and simply surrender power and leave the country? Well, I'm of the view that he will not do so. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So you're of the view that this is going to be a protracted internal conflict, perhaps outside forces being drawn ever more inexorably in, providing weapons. As you mentioned, the Russians are providing weapons to the government, but other people are providing weapons to the opponents, too. WISSAM TARIF : Well, we have seen this uprising for the first six months, when it was very peaceful, people were taking to the streets with bare chests and asking for their freedom, facing tanks and live ammunition from the regime side. WISSAM TARIF : Of course there is a militarized wing of the revolution that has started in the last three months, and it's gaining legitimacy and popularity from the people on the streets because the Free Syrian Army at this stage is protecting people, is protecting the protestors and protecting property. WISSAM TARIF : But we have to be realistic here. The Free Syrian Army, when it comes to the kinds of weapons they are using or the amount of ammunition they have, it's nothing compared to what al-Assad has. Al-Assad have tanks, has helicopters, has missiles, rockets, everything. Al-Assad can take the cities and the suburbs of Damascus by force. Of course he can. But the big question is : Can he afford the political price for that? Because this will come on a huge human cost. We're talking about thousands and thousands of civilians that he has to kill in the process. But the big question is : So imposing order, in effect, means a huge number of casualties from civilians. So of course this is not an acceptable solution for the people in Syria or the international community. But the big question is : One more point here, which I think is of extreme importance. The international community has to assume responsibility. Those dictators did not survive by themselves. Those dictators have had the leverage and the privilege of support of the West, of the United States and of Europe, and of other nations. But the big question is : Now that people here are uprising, they are saying enough is enough, yes the West has interests in this part of the world, but these interests can be achieved and can be obtained by talking and befriending with the people in the Middle East, not with dictators. But the big question is : The era for dictators is over. People want freedom and want dignity. This is the bottom line. And as the West supported dictators, now they have to support the people who are asking for their freedom. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Wissam Tarif, thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate it. WISSAM TARIF : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Wissam Tarif, Arab world campaigner with Avaaz, he joined us from his home in Lebanon. With us now is Anne-Marie Slaughter, former policy planning director under Secretary Clinton. She is currently a politics and international affairs professor at Princeton. She wrote about how the world could and should intervene in Syria for The Atlantic and joins us now from a studio at Princeton University. Nice to have you with us today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : DR. ANNE-MARIE SLAUGHTER: It's my pleasure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And one of the problems you pointed out with intervention: Well, it's very messy. You also pointed out the problems of a lack of intervention could be even more messy. A full-fledged civil war in Syria, you wrote, could quickly become a proxy war between Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and at least some NATO countries on one side against Iran, Russia, Hezbollah and possibly Iraq and Hamas on the other. SLAUGHTER : Yeah, the prospect of a Syrian civil war turning into a larger proxy war is very real. Already, Russia is clearly arming Syria. Iran backs Syria strongly. Hezbollah has been a Syrian ally and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 on the one side. And of course, Iraq has taken the view, thus far, it's stood with the Syrian government. SLAUGHTER : So if it comes down to a rebel army, the protestors - enough defections so really there is a full-fledged army fighting on the opposition side against the Syrian army, you're going to have those countries arming the government, and at some point then the - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, the states that have been supporting the opposition or at least looking for a solution - will have to be on the other side. SLAUGHTER : And we cannot afford a - that kind of a conflict in the heart of the Middle East. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : So how do you avoid it? Is there a role for diplomacy still? SLAUGHTER : I do think there's still a role for diplomacy. Indeed, I think when Steven Cook was raising the idea of intervention and I said at least that's to be thinkable, part of that is to try to make clear that we want a diplomatic solution, and we need to create the incentives to get one. It does depend tremendously in the first instance on the region. The Arab League has been more active than anybody could have imagined in terms of taking a stance, sending in monitors, calling now for Assad to step down. SLAUGHTER : If they can put a lot of pressure on Russia at the Security Council more than I think the standard Western-versus-Russia pressure, that is probably our best hope of a diplomatic solution. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the - of course, the threat to intervene has to be backed up by the willingness to intervene, no? SLAUGHTER : It does. This is important. It's important, too, though, for the credibility of the West as a whole. When the West - when the U.N. authorized intervention in Libya, it authorized intervention under the doctrine of responsibility to protect, which says if a government is failing to protect its people by committing genocide or crimes against humanity or ethnic cleansing, really grave and systematic crimes, then the international community can intervene to protect. SLAUGHTER : We did that in Libya. At this point, as you pointed out, there are many thousands of people who've died in Syria. That's - if that continues, at some point, the credibility of the international community is on the line. I think, though, we can't intervene unless there is a pretty unified request to begin with from the Syrian people. They're the people we would be trying to protect. They have to resolve that debate on their own. And then, it has to go through the region and finally through the regional organization and then finally to the U.N. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And if the Russians, as we have every reason to expect, unless they change their minds, veto, what then? SLAUGHTER : That's the hardest question. In my view, if the - if you had a request from the Arab League backed by the protesters themselves and you had a - perhaps a super majority on the Security Council, meaning nine, 10, 11 out of the 15 vote to support, then I would be willing to countenance action even in the face of a veto as we did in Kosovo. When it comes down to this kind of humanitarian intervention, I think the rules surrounding the veto are more complicated, and there are precedents as in Kosovo for acting even in the face of a veto. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Anne-Marie Slaughter is with us from Princeton University, former director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department. We're back with Kelly McEvers from Beirut. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And, Kelly McEvers, it's fair to say that every next step that we've heard - buffer zones, no-fly zones - is seen by the government as the next step toward removing it from power. It's regime change. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Yes. You know, I think the regime feels like it's got its back against the wall in that regard, but it's up to now as - is confident in the fact that Russia will stand behind it. And so I think that's where it's able to sort of exercise, you know, the - sort of the crackdowns that it has and the power that it has in, you know, attacking civilians, attacking civilian neighborhoods and escalating the violence in the way that it has over the weekend. You know, this - the Syrian regime is very, very aware of its position in the international community and its position in the world. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : This is not Libya. You know, Syria is in the heart of the Arab world. It is bordered by Iraq, you know, Turkey, Lebanon, places that have had their own problems in the past. And the Syrian regime is very acutely aware of the fact that the international community does not want a major quagmire. And so - and that the international community knows that intervention could bring such a quagmire or no intervention could bring such a quagmire. So they're using this stalemate. They're using this sort of indecision as a way to go in and take as much control as possible. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, let's go next to Hannah(ph). Hannah with us from Raleigh, North Carolina. HANNAH : Hi. I just wanted to see the idea of removing Bashar Assad and having Farouk Sharaa take over. I don't think that's going to serve the Syrian people any good because - I mean, as a Syrian myself, I think Bashar Assad is the weakest link in the whole regime. To leave anybody from that regime is a mistake. I think the Syrian people has suffered enough - long enough under all of those people, and this kind of solution, I believe, is only to give Bashar Assad a way out without being harmed and keep the same things, you know, not changed in Syria. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So what is the alternative? HANNAH : I think thousands of us do actually arm the Syrian people and let them get rid of the regime themselves. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Anne-Marie Slaughter, arm the Syrian people, that would presumably be done by various degrees of covert or overt by Turkey. SLAUGHTER : Well, by Turkey and possibly other countries in the region. I do want the Syrian people to be able to determine their own fate. But again, if we can get a political solution, it would be far, far better. Violence begets violence. The more killing there is, the more other groups who are affected want to take revenge. And as we've been talking about the number of people in Syria, the number of minorities who are already worried, who are also Syrian people - the Druze, the Kurds, the Alawites, the Christians. SLAUGHTER : If you arm the Syrian people, you really could get not only civil war but a kind of anarchy. So at this point, I think we want to do everything we can to use the kind of pressure, including a legitimate or a credible threat of intervention to bring the parties to the negotiating table. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hannah, thanks very much for the phone call. Appreciate it. HANNAH : All right. Thank you. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And now the opinion page, but something of a departure from our usual 800-word argument. In the cover story of this weekend's New York Times magazine, Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman says Israel has long posed a three-part test to decide whether it's time to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities. Would such attacks make a severe dent in Iran's program? Can Israel count on international support, particularly from the United States? Have all measures short of war been exhausted? Bergman concludes that Israel's political leadership is convinced that for the first time, the answers to all those questions is yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you have questions about the logic and consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, give us a call. 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. Ronen Bergman is an analyst for the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and author of the \"Secret War with Iran.\" He joins us now, via Skype, from Jerusalem. Nice to have you back on the program. Ronen Bergman, are you there? And we're having difficulties reaching Ronen Bergman, who's the analyst for Yedioth Ahronoth in Jerusalem. He's also the author of the New York Times cover story on its most recent Sunday Times magazine. He's back with us by phone now. Are you with us there? NEAL CONAN, HOST : DR. RONEN BERGMAN: Yeah, I'm here. I'm sorry. Something has gone wrong with the Skype connection. Can you hear me? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes, fine. And things happen from time to time. You sound fine on the phone. We'll stick to that. You've come to the conclusion at the end of your story that Israel will attack Iran in this calendar year. Why now? BERGMAN : Because of a few reasons, and the most important of them is that, according to the latest intelligence estimates from Israel, Iran is just about to enter, what is termed by Minister of Defense Ehud Barak and by Israeli intelligence, as the immunity zone. And that immunity zone is a point in time, on the timeline of the advancement of the Iranian nuclear project, after which the Iranian nuclear facilities are going to be immune, or almost immune, to an Israeli strike. And according to the latest intelligence available to Israel, Iran is about to enter the immunity zone within nine to 12 months. BERGMAN : And the Israeli's are trying to warn that if a decision is not taken during this time, from now until the mid or end of 2012, then it would be too late to take a decision. Or as the Defense Minister Barak has said, he said that after 2012, the issue of a nuclear Iran would be also important. Serious, interesting, but then he says the issue is going to be taken from our hand - the decision making process, the makers of policy, politicians - to your hands, journalists and historians. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's... BERGMAN : Therefore, 2012 is the critical year. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's important to say it's not the conclusion that Iran would have a deliverable nuclear weapon at the end of this calendar year, just that the window for a successful attack would close. BERGMAN : The latest intelligence suggests - and I think this is agreed by most intelligence agencies working on the Iranian issue \u2013 is that once an order is given - and this is according to a promise that the scientist of Iran gave it to the supreme leader. Once the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, gives the order, they are able to produce the first nuclear device within a nine-month period, and then to take another half a year to a year to miniaturize that device to fit the shoulders of a Shahab-3 missile that can hit Israel. And therefore, from the point of view of Israel, Israel seeing an Iranian nuclear bomb as a sort of an existential threat, the threat is imminent or almost imminent. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I'm sure that there will be objections on any number of levels. But one of them is that Israel, the United States and most other intelligence services around the world believed in 2003 that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and they were wrong. BERGMAN : Yeah. The Iraqi lesson is important and should be taught and learned throughout the intelligence services throughout the world, but this is very, very different. In Iraq, there were speculations. There was some dangerous information. In the Iranian case, we are talking about the IAEA, who has just released a very, very clear report accusing Iran of violation of the NPT. And this report is based upon the inspectors of the agency taking whatever inspection they should have taken in - on Iranian (unintelligible) inside the Iranian facility. And the Iranians themselves, you know, they have claimed that they have - they are enriching uranium to the point of 19.7 percent, and they are far beyond closing the nuclear fuel cycle. BERGMAN : The argument is what are the targets of the Iranian leadership in this nuclear project? The Iranians claim that they have only peaceful targets, and the intelligence services worldwide do not believe them. And I can tell you, Neal, that even in all (unintelligible) conversation, even Russian intelligence, the Chinese intelligence official, all of them agree that Iran is aiming at assembling a bomb. And if they were not aiming, then the whole mouse-and-cat game that they are playing with the international community and the IAEA wouldn't have happen because they wouldn't have anything to hide. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Just a clarification of the couple of the acronyms Ronen Bergman used, the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, which was highly skeptical of the claims of a nuclear weapon in Iraq before the war in 2003. Also the NPT, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory and to which binds it to not produce nuclear weapons. And let me just follow up. There are - as you point out in your article, this is hardly a debate that is one-sided. In Israel, former Mossad chief Meir Dagan says an attack would be a serious mistake. It would set Iran back only temporarily, and that Israel then would risk a ferocious counterattack. BERGMAN : The debate is - was heated in Israel following up Meir Dagan's meeting with some journalists. I was among them on his last day in office. And basically he said that the idea to attack here militarily is stupid. That Mossad was able - hinting to covert actions that were attributed to Mossad sabotaging the Iranian nuclear facilities and killing some scientists. These attempts were able to delay the project significantly. He was talking about 215(ph) as the year in which Iran will be able to assemble the first nuclear device. And thus, the sword, he said, is not on our neck, and we should not take a military action that would have an inevitable day-after effect that are going to be horrific to the Israeli population. That is his point of view and his point of view should be heard and taken seriously. BERGMAN : But I would say that after weeks of researching for this New York Times piece that you mentioned, I would sum up and say that most of the leadership of Israel, including Mossad's current assessment, military intelligence and others, all of them agreed that the timeline is very different, that Iran would be able to produce the first device within a year, and that sanctions, the - or the combination between sanctions and covert actions are not significantly effective, and are not holding the Iranian nuclear project. Therefore, unless something happens and the Iranians agree suddenly to all conditions posed by the international community - but unless something unexpected is happening, my assessment is that the leadership of Israel would take the decision knowing that it would lead to a possible problematic outcome. BERGMAN : And we can discuss this maybe later. What are going to be these outcomes? But knowing that it might lead to these outcomes - but when comparing the possible outcomes, including rockets fired at Israel (unintelligible) cities, including terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets overseas, but banishing these as problematic and as tragic as they can be with the possibility of Iran being armed with nuclear arsenal, they would make a choice, they will make a decision to send the bombers. BERGMAN : Israel being a country I would say suffering past traumas, with the mindset to do everything to prevent a second holocaust, and with this comparison being drawn - I think, it's the wrong comparison, but yet it's still there - a comparison between Adolf Hitler and President Ahmadinejad, a comparison that is prompt by Prime Minister Netanyahu - when you put all of this together, you end up with one administration only, and this is to do whatever Israel can to prevent Iran from obtaining this capability.

Interstate traffickers, local dealers and addicts take advantage of loose regulations that allow doctors to establish so-called pill mills. Of course, there are many legitimate doctors and legitimate patients as well. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If prescription drug abuse has hit your family, give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. Amy Pavuk is a crime and courts reporter for the Orlando Sentinel, and she joins us here at member station WMFE in Orlando. Pleasure to have you with us. AMY PAVUK : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also with us is Tom Parkinson, MORNING EDITION host here at WMFE and a reporter at member station covering this issue. Nice to have you with us, Tom. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : Nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Amy, I have to ask, one of the questions that thought my regulate this was a registry that recorded every prescription and every sale. Thirty-five other states have it. Florida's supposed to take effect last October. AMY PAVUK : Florida now has a prescription drug monitoring program. That was something that drew sharp criticism from leaders across the country, including from the White House because it is touted as a tool that is one of the most effective in combating the state and the nation's prescription drug epidemic. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And how effective has it been in the months since it's taken effect? AMY PAVUK : It is a little bit too soon to tell. It hasn't been in effect that long, but law enforcement who I've spoken to have started using it. They use it to track what doctors are prescribing and what citizens are receiving in prescription. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Meanwhile, there are hundreds of these so-called pill mills that says, you know, pain center, pain medication. The purposes are quite legitimate. AMY PAVUK : There are. This is one of the things that law enforcement and legislators made clear, which - our state has plenty of legit pain clinics. It is just this small number of so-called pill mills that are causing the problem. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And these are individual places run by individual doctors who issue a lot of scripts. AMY PAVUK : They do. They are accused of just prescribing a plethora of pills without any true legitimate need. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so these end up in the hands of, well, either local dealers or, in fact, sometimes interstate dealers. AMY PAVUK : They do. There's a term that law enforcement has coined here called the pillbilly. That is referred to as citizens in - from Kentucky, Ohio, you name it, who travel here specifically to get pills. They can get them, and then they return to their home state and fill them. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the markup, as I gather, if you buy an OxyContin pill, for example, from a prescription, it's about $1, maybe $10 then on the street here in Florida, maybe $40 a pill if you're selling that in, just to pick a place, Kentucky. AMY PAVUK : That's true. And we're hearing that the amount is actually going up now that the supply is dwindling. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Tom Parkinson, what kind of an effect is all this having on this community? TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : It's just been devastating, Neal. It's - as one of Amy's sources actually said recently, if there were seven people a day dying from any other disease, authorities would be all over it. This was allowed to continue for far too long. And that's one of the reasons why it became so severe here in Florida because for at least a decade, there was lax to no regulation on these clinics. No pill mill - or pill monitoring database, so doctor shopping was relatively easy to do. And I wanted to go back to your point about the pill mills. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : I recently interviewed Sheriff Jerry Demings, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings about this and asked the sheriff, you know, how can you tell? What's - how can you tell the difference between a legitimate pain management clinic and a so-called pill mill? These places, you have to understand, Neal, they were - look like just storefronts. They would be wedged between a laundromat and a pawnshop or something. A patient would basically show up with any kind of vague complaint of back or neck pain or whatever, receive a perfunctory, if any, physical examination and then be written a scrip for hundreds of doses of these highly addictive pills on a cash-only basis. They're open 24 hours a day, till 3:00 a.m. or something, armed guards, sign saying you're not allowed to sell your drugs to other patients. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : This doesn't describe the picture of when I go to my physician. It's not like that. There are no armed guards there. So clearly, if you have a line of people outside a building at 3:00 a.m. paying cash, something is not right there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Amy Pavuk, is that accurate? These are places that dispense as well as prescribe? AMY PAVUK : Well, technically they can't dispense themselves anymore. That was part of the legislation that was recently enacted. But yes, I've been to these pill mills myself. It is not uncommon to see lines of people standing outside. As Tom mentions, armed security.  It's just - it's not routine. It's not standard, what people would consider general care. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet when law enforcement tries to intervene, the person says here's my prescription and here are my pills. It's perfectly legal. AMY PAVUK : Right. And that's one of the defenses that the patients and the doctors have, particularly the doctors who say, you know, I prescribed this to this patient. I told them to take one pill a day. I did not tell them to take 30 pills at one time, and I certainly didn't tell them to sell them either. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the - and they have a legitimate complaint. This my business and why are you messing with me? AMY PAVUK : Right. And that's what makes these criminal investigations so difficult, is because law enforcement essentially has to hire or get doctors involved to assess these and look at these and say, OK, if this person came in with a back pain, what would you ordinarily do? Would you do this? Would you do that? Would you send them to a specialty doctor? And they really have to assess this on a case-by-case basis, which makes building these cases so tedious and time consuming. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Tom Parkinson, you think a pattern would indicate - well, a pattern - if you're dispensing large numbers of pills to large numbers of people, maybe people should get suspicious. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : Yes. And to their credit, law enforcement is cracking down, and it apparently is having a tremendous impact. They're just getting started on it, but the latest figures I've had is more than 400 clinics have been closed down in the last year. Prosecutors have indicted dozens of pill mill operators. Eighty doctors have lost their licenses. A number of doctors have gone to prison, and we're talking, you know, five, 10, 15-year sentences. So they really are cracking down. It seems to be having an effect. One telling number, I think, is the doctor purchases of oxycodone dropped from 35 million doses in period of 2010 to less than a million, 925,000. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Wow. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : So it obviously is having an effect. But there are a number of unintended consequences, Neal, because these are highly addictive medications, and you don't just wake up - if you're addicted to one of these pills, you don't just wake up one morning and say, oh, it's illegal now or my pill mill is closed, I'm going to quit. These people are going elsewhere, and those are some of the unintended consequences that I talked to Jerry Demings, the sheriff, about. They're seeing a huge spike in illegal street drug sales and also a huge spike in armed robberies of pharmacies, drug cargo heists, all kinds of... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ancillary... TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : Ancillary, yeah, unintended consequences. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll get to the calls in just a minute. But, Amy Pavuk, where do these places get their pills from? AMY PAVUK : Well, it used to be the doctors in Florida could buy their pills directly from the manufacturers, hence why we saw the numbers that we were seeing for years, such as in 2010, 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors in the nation were from Florida. It's a huge number. It's obviously decreasing now. And so now drug addicts and abusers, when they can get their pills from doctors, or if they don't buy them on the street, they are going to have to turn to pharmacies. But with that said, at least one pharmacy chain is implementing some changes.  CVS recently sent a letter to what it deemed high-dispensing doctors, telling them that it was no longer going to fill their prescriptions for pain killers and other scheduled substances. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I assume doctors are saying, wait a minute, how do you get to decide which doctor's prescriptions to fill and which you don't? AMY PAVUK : Exactly. They're calling it discriminatory. One, you know, several people are referring to it as a black list and saying that, you know, look, you're pegging us as criminals when we haven't been arrested. We're not under investigation. But a story that I investigated that ran recently showed that quite a few people on that list actually either have been arrested or under investigation, so there is some correlation between CVS's list and what law enforcement and health department officials are doing. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : That should be pointed out, Neal. These people - we're not talking Dr. Kildare here. People - you uncovered some of the people in your - on that list in your piece, excellent piece that ran on Saturday in the Sentinel. Could you tell us a little, Amy, about who some of these doctors were? I mean, pretty shady characters. AMY PAVUK : Sure. Sure. I looked at the doctors from Central Florida. There is one doctor who was arrested for not just allegedly - again, he hasn't gone to trial, hasn't been convicted - not just for allegedly running a pill mill, but also hosting wild sex and drug parties at his home. He invited... TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : With his patients. \n\n ###",

You have people who range from him to simply doctors who have a lot of fatal overdoses associated with their patients, and law enforcement looks in and says, why is this person having four and five overdoses of their patient base in a year or two? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get a caller in on the conversation. 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. Sam's with us from Merritt Island here in Florida. SAM : Yeah, how are you doing? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good, thanks. SAM : Yeah, I don't know how relevant it is, but I have a sister-in-law who was recently arrested for selling OxyContin, and she would use several people to purchase pills for her, from Miami to Orlando. They would pick doctors from Miami or Orlando that they could get their pills from. And she was arrested, and none of the doctors were prosecuted, as far as I know. But she is back out, and she is doing the same thing again and using the same people. And I was just wondering, you know, if they couldn't possibly put certain people on a list that, I mean these people don't need and shouldn't be prescribed these drugs, you know? I mean, they're using the same mules each time. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Amy Pavuk, any prospect of such a list? AMY PAVUK : Well, two things come to mind: One, what you're referring to about your sister, those are actually what law enforcement in Florida refers to as sponsors. There's a lead person who quote-unquote \"sponsors\" other people to get drugs for them. That's one thing. The other aspect is this database that Florida now has will track that. AMY PAVUK : So if your sister has four people going and getting drugs for her, law enforcement and pharmacists can now track who those people are and what they're buying. They don't have free access to that database. Law enforcement has to prove that they're already investigating the person, but that is what Florida's new database, which really has only been unveiled actually just a matter of weeks, if not just a few months - that's what it's intended to do. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sam, we hope your sister gets out of the trap. SAM : Sorry? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the - we hope your sister gets out of the trap she's in. SAM : Yeah, my sister-in-law, and I sure hope so too. And I was just upset that they had all the prescriptions with the names on them and none of the other people were sought either. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Thanks very much. We're talking about prescription drugs and so-called pill mills here in Florida. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This email from Ashley: I'm pharmacist, newly graduated in May. I currently work for Walgreens, and I have  found that I am more of babysitter against pain and stimulant drug abusers than a health care professional. People abuse these drugs at a ridiculous rate and get angry when I tell them the risks they're putting themselves to by taking too many. In regards to prescribers, I see legitimate and potentially illegitimate prescribing practices. However, I can't prove any illegitimacy, so I'm stuck with dispensing hundreds of pain and stimulant meds to one person at a time. It's extremely frustrating. She's writing from Davenport, Iowa. And I assume, Tom, that's the situation a lot of pharmacists here find themselves in. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : Yeah, it seems to be that way. And as Amy and I have both said, law - there are new laws in place, state laws and county and municipal laws, and they seem to be working. They seem to be taking effect, but it's probably going to take a long time to know if that's really going to work. And Neil,, I think it needs to be said, as this caller pointed out, that many of these people, you know, they didn't set out to become junkies. They were injured in a car accident or some other way and some legitimate physician prescribed these drugs to them, and then they became addicted. TOM PARKINSON, BYLINE : And there's many others, it should be said, that have a legitimate need for these medications and use them responsibly, as prescribed and do not abuse them, just as there are many doctors who legitimately prescribe the drugs. But these new laws, including the prescription drug database, are just riddled with loopholes, all kinds of loopholes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can go next to - this is Fred. Fred with us from Ocala, Florida. FRED : Yeah, I had to laugh when you said about legitimate doctors. My son was in an auto accident and he went and saw a, quote, \"legitimate doctor,\" who due to the pain of the injury gave him prescription for 180 OcyContins. Well, that was about $40,000 out of my bank book ago, and it - we've been fighting(ph)   it for three years. He gives him a script for the OcyContins without even a return visit. So - and this was a respected doctor in the community, supposedly. FRED : But my son, I constantly try to get him off. I get him clean. I even put him in jail for nine months. I get him clean. He goes fine for months, falls back off the wagon. It's a horrible, horrible disease, if you want to call it a disease or an addiction. But his sources - when he goes straight and we talk a lot, trying to get him straight - his main sources - and he tells me they're going for 20 to 40 dollars a pill on the street - are the - he tells me a lot of senior citizens are getting prescriptions. FRED : They're supporting themselves off it because people you would never expect to be drug dealers are, you know, 60, 50, 60 years old getting prescriptions because they don't have a good pension, and they're supporting themselves by reselling their pills. Also, a great deal of the pills he was purchasing were coming from guys who were getting them from the VA. You know... \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The fine art of the pitch can be difficult to master, but all of us take a shot at least from time to time. We try to convince the boss on a great idea, persuade investors to back our invention, sell an editor on a story, a producer on a film or a TV show, an employer on yours truly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Everybody knows you're supposed to keep it short and strong, but like a sharp curveball, a well-intentioned pitch can sometimes wind up in the dirt.

But first, Lori Greiner has been called the queen of QVC, where she hosts the show \"Clever and Unique Creations.\" She's also one of the sharks, the judges on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" and she joins us by phone from Westchester in Pennsylvania. Nice to have you with us today. LORI GREINER : Hi, Neal, nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also with us, Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, a senior vice president at National Geographic Channel, with us here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you with us, too. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Thanks so much for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Lori, let me ask you first. I know you have about 110 patents. So what's the most important lesson you learned about making a pitch over the years? LORI GREINER : Well, I think the most important thing is to have something that will grab the attention of who you're pitching to in one sentence. You've got to get them fast and immediate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So the high concept, as it is. LORI GREINER : Yes, the high content, I think, and doing it with confidence and passion. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So the person pitching is as important. Great ideas don't sell themselves. LORI GREINER : No, great ideas don't sell themselves. I think it's equally as important who's doing the pitch and that they are passionate about what they're pitching and very confident. I think people don't like when you're not confident about what you're pitching, and they don't want to invest in you or get behind you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Now, as one of the sharks, you are the recipient of pitches, and what do you see people - can you give us an example of something somebody did wrong? LORI GREINER : Well, I think a couple things that I noticed people did wrong, one was having a lack of enthusiasm or confidence in what they were pitching. If they don't believe in it, you're not going to. And I think when doing the pitch, missing opportunities. LORI GREINER : So when you see that people are reacting and they're ready to give you an offer, or, you know, they say when you've already gotten, that they're sealing the deal, walk away, say yes and take it, I think many people miss opportunities by continuing to haggle or dicker about little points. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, because you're in the studio here, I could see you nodding when you say missed opportunities. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Yeah, I think that there is an art to listening in the pitch that sometimes people forget. Oftentimes you've got great sales people going in to give the pitch, and they forget I can listen and ask questions and really jump on those opportunities that do come up, get to know the buyer and what it is that they're looking for and learn how to position yourself as the problem-solver, their problem-solver, because really at the end of the day a lot of the people with deep pockets and money to spend, they want to invest in their own idea. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : So if you listen, you can figure out, all right, how do I make this seem like it was their idea. And that's the master, the people that can really get a lot of things through, that's the way they do it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So how many pitches do you get per week? BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Oh, goodness. Well, right now we're at a conference, and I've probably received about 50 this morning. That's unusual. Typically it would be more about 10 to 20 a day. \n\n ###",

BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : You know, technology is becoming more of a - playing a larger role. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Not a PowerPoint, please. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : No, no, definitely, not for us. For National Geographic Channel, you know, we need amazing visuals, and we want to be in business with the most creative people that can also execute. So before, when I started at Geographic about eight years ago, it was all verbal pitch, and it was a four-page treatment, and that was it.

You have to make the demo reel. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : It's true. Investing in your own pitch is important. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lori Greiner, is that something that you've learned over the years too, the technology has shifted? LORI GREINER : Well, I think not as much for what I do. You know, products can actually still just be sketched out on a piece of paper, or ideas, and then sent over to your factories, and they can make you up a sample or a prototype. LORI GREINER : So I think it's a little bit different just because of the different industries that we're in. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from those of you who get pitched all the time. If you're an editor, a producer, well, a boss, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And I wonder, Lori Greiner, as you've developed this talent over the years, do you find that it serves you well in other walks of life? LORI GREINER : Oh, absolutely. I think running a business, doing what I've done for the last - since 1996, has taught me so many things because I started from just an idea and then had to figure out how to make it, market it, every single thing from soup to nuts on how to get a product done and out there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : 'Cause we think of that product, well, of course the person knew every aspect of the production process. No, as it turns out, you just had an idea and had to learn everything else. LORI GREINER : Right, exactly. I had to figure it out for myself. I think today there's a lot more available to people, a show like \"Shark Tank\" and different websites where people can give their idea and have people that can help them get it to market, whereas back when I started, there really wasn't much like that out there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You're - Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, you mentioned you're at this conference, the Real Screen Summit, where reality television producers from all over the - and we don't think of National Geographic as reality TV, but it is, and even a project like \"Restrepo,\" the great documentary that was - well, let me put it bluntly, should have won the Academy Award... BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...that was pitched to you too, and that kind of programming. So it runs the gamut. And those kinds of programs, but for people pitching ideas, something like the Real Screen Summit, I mean that's got to be, you know, Nirvana. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Uh-huh. And one of the mistakes that oftentimes people make is that they think that they know National Geographic because it's an amazing brand, it's been around for 100-plus years. But oftentimes they filter their ideas then. So they - I can't tell you how many ideas on Everest I get. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : At every meeting, somebody comes in the first time, they have a great Everest idea. But we have evolved, and we're always evolving, and it's important to get to know the buyer. I think the first time - you have to be persistent as well. You have to get in the door, and that's difficult... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Getting the meeting is hard, yes. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, so if you have three or four ideas, you've got the meeting on the Everest proposal, but wait a minute, there's this K2 proposal, it's even better. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Oftentimes I say, all right, you pitched me those ideas. What else is in that bag? What are you pitching to other people that you think that I wouldn't do? Because we are - we're evolving, and you can't think of where we want to be nine months from now. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I wonder, Lori Greiner, is that aspect true in your business too? LORI GREINER : Absolutely. You never know what's going to be the next great thing, whether it's a product or a business.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Is pitching an investor different than pitching, well - I don't know, Lori Greiner, if you have a lot of experience pitching editors, but I assume you have a lot of experience pitching investors. LORI GREINER : Yes, I've had a lot - I have pitched, and I have had a lot of people pitch me. And I think I agree with Bridget. An interesting other facet it is knowing who you're pitching to, the same as knowing how to pitch. Listening, as she said, is important because I've seen times where there might be several decision-makers in a room, and if one person gets slighted, it could change the mix of the whole reaction to everybody sitting there. LORI GREINER : Whereas, you know, if you're sure that you're making your pitch to everybody and engaging everybody, I think that's very helpful. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget? BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : You know, that also brings up or makes me think of picking your pitching partner is also important. Oftentimes I see people come in with someone who's very similar. I mean we all like working with people that have a similar background and you can relate to. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : But there is an advantage to having a pitching partner who might be a different age or who might be a different gender because  you can appeal to a wider base. You don't know who's going to be in the audience all the time. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : So for - in the entertainment world, when I was on the producing side, I could go into MTV and I'd be on, but my maybe more seasoned boss, when we'd go to PBS, he'd be on. And you can play off each other that way and make sure that you're reaching a larger audience. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get John(ph) on the line, John calling us from Detroit. JOHN : Hey, how you doing? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good, thanks. JOHN : As a - I'm an event promoter, and one of the biggest things that annoys me, and I get several pitches daily, is the lack of originality. I get so many people that want to take an existing product. I promote events. I get so tired of people wanting to bring the same kind of events in or the same products, just changed over their way. JOHN : You know, I'm looking for fresh new things, not the same old stuff just reproduced. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So somebody might say it's just like this except with a twist. JOHN : Well, what they'll do is they'll come in and they'll say, well, I have this line of apparel that I'd like to sell at your events. And it's just like the other three brands that I have already for sale at the events. And there's no originality to it. They're just putting the same kind of graphics on there and just a different color. \n\n ###",

Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. If you're incredibly lucky, you'll come up with an idea that sells itself, for an app that offers a tidy solution to a universal problem, for a restaurant that launches the next big fad, for a product that's perfectly timed to hit the shelves now. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you're not - and let's face it, most of us aren't - crafting the perfect pitch to drive investors to their checkbooks is your best hope, and that's where today's guests come in. Lori Greiner is known as the queen of QVC. She's one of the sharks on ABC's \"Shark Tank\"; and Bridget Hunnicutt of National Geographic Channel is the brains behind the reality show \"Witness\" and the documentary \"Restrepo,\" which was nominated for an Academy Award. NEAL CONAN, HOST : They know what it takes to make a good pitch. So if you are pitched regularly, as a boss, an editor, an investor, what's the pitch you heard that absolutely flopped? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We have an email from Juliette(ph) in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin: You invited comments from bosses and businesspeople, but parents hear more pitches than any typical person in a day. So I suspect she's right about that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get another caller on the line, though. This is Victor, Victor with us from Charleston in South Carolina. VICTOR : Hello, Neal, how are you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : I'm well, thank you. VICTOR : Good. I was a circuit court judge for 12 years. I have had people pitch stuff to me on a daily basis that those folks that you're talking to have never heard of. NEAL CONAN, HOST : These are people pitching, to some degree, for their lives. VICTOR : Yes, or certainly their freedom, or their fine. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what works - well, I'm sure that, you know, the proper amount of deference, the proper amount of taking responsibility for what they did, I'm sure that's something that worked in your, or may have worked in your case that might not be applicable in other cases. VICTOR : Well, it's always interesting because, you know, realistically speaking, when you're dealing with that particular environment, whether it's white collar or DUI or anything else, you're talking about education, mental health. You're talking about employability, all of those kinds of things come into play. VICTOR : And I find that the people, the lawyers especially, that pitch to me were the ones that stuck to the facts and put together something that was extremely verifiable. And that tended to be a lot more effective than someone utilizing social or poor me or I didn't do it or the victim was as bad as I was type thing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, stick to the facts, verifiable, that's got to be important in your business. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Absolutely. We want that kind of credibility. We demand it. And I think that also just honesty. When you're working, or when you're receiving a pitch, you get a sense of how close is that person to the actual content. How knowledgeable are they? And you get that sincerity, and that's also important, and it'll come through in the final product. So that's also important for us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Lori Greiner, integrity, well, the people who come up with products are - some are charlatans. That kind of integrity, verifiability, that's got to be critical in your business. LORI GREINER : Absolutely. I would never invest in or want a business partner who I didn't feel would have integrity and that I could totally trust and was a good partner for me. So I think it's absolutely critical. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Victor, can you remember one occasion that was either spectacularly good or spectacularly bad? VICTOR : Me? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. VICTOR : Oh yeah. Quite frankly it was very interesting to hear someone plead for life in a death penalty case, and the lawyers did a very, very good job. The unfortunate thing was his record certainly did not verify any sort of mercy with regard to that particular case. And it (unintelligible) to me. VICTOR : The more difficult ones are things like accidental deaths and driving accidents in South Carolina, when you can wind up with a homicide scenario, where in reality it was truly an accident. Anything involving alcohol winds up being a homicide. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, Victor, thanks very much, and it's nice to have you remind us of the importance of this craft from time to time. Appreciate it. VICTOR : Verifiability is the one thing that I think is most important. Anybody that's either applying for a job or a guilty plea or anything else needs to certainly have verifiable documentation when they make their pitch. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thank you. Let's see if we can go next to - this is Steve, Steve with us from Jenks in Oklahoma. STEVE : Hi, Neal, how are you doing? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good, thanks. STEVE : Well, I just want to say that I am constantly amazed at the pitches I get as a small community newspaper in a suburb in Tulsa that don't even have anything to do with even Oklahoma a lot of times. I get stuff from FEMA. I get stuff from - on just disasters that happen halfway across the country or even local events, you know, 50 miles away. They just seem to send news releases, and they don't take into account the audiences that they're sending those to. STEVE : And I guess they think that if they throw enough, you know, at the wall, something's going to stick somewhere, but you know, a lot of times I can call and find out, OK, yeah, there is a local angle, there is a resident of Jenks or Bixby or Glenpool, Oklahoma, the three towns that I write for, but I don't have time to call them all the time. STEVE : So I think a lot of times if the PR people, you know, would maybe take a little bit more time to, you know, figure out a local angle to pitch these stories, especially to, you know, community newspapers, I think that would help them get their message out a lot more. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Steve, that's very interesting, thanks very much. STEVE : OK, thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You were talking earlier, Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, of - you want people who are convincing you that in fact the idea was yours to begin with and in fact that maybe they can solve your problem. I wonder if you could overdo that, if somebody can come in who says, you know, you've got a real problem at 8:00 at night and I can help you with that. You know, that could be a little too much. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Absolutely. You need to walk that line very gracefully. But I think at the end of the day, if you can figure out what the buyer's problem is, and you can position yourself as the problem solver, you'll have a lead for the next pitch. Even if you don't have the perfect fit in that meeting, the next time around you'll be the one that they call, and you can come in prepared and more in line with what he's looking for in Tulsa. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it sounds like there's another part of this, and I wanted to ask you, Lori Greiner, about this too. You can't take it too personally. No is a perfectly acceptable answer. Next time it might be yes, so don't get too upset. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Right. I think you also have to worry about - you know, sometimes some buyers aren't comfortable saying no. Like on \"Shark Tank,\" that's fabulous because they just let them have it. But in reality, a lot of buyers will kind of go, huh, that's interesting. So as a pitcher, you have to learn how to read between the lines, and you need to be able to say, oh, that one's not going anywhere, this one is the one they like. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lori Greiner? LORI GREINER : I think that when - sometimes you're helping a person by saying no. If they don't have a good idea or something that you don't think is going to make it, if you tell them no, you might be saving them a lot of time and money. Sometimes putting out a lot of money and effort, people have lost their homes, they've destroyed themselves financially. So sometimes you're actually doing them a favor and being nice by saying no if you really think it won't work. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Have you ever had a situation where you get pitched something, and it's terrible pitch, but you say wait a minute, there's an idea there that maybe we can work with? LORI GREINER : I think yes, that has happened, and I think sometimes the person is so appealing that maybe what they're pitching isn't great, but you believe in them, and they're so creative and charismatic and hard-working and passionate that I want to be involved with them, and so I might try to bring them in and then see what can we do with them and where can we go that might be different than what they first came in with. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Marianna(ph), Marianna with us from Houston. MARIANNA : Hi there. You know, it's fascinating listening to this. (Unintelligible) and I work as the marketing and community relations director for a local firm. And my pet peeve when being pitched is when someone assumes that I'm not the one to make the decisions because I am a young woman. MARIANNA : I love when they tell me, well, can you go check with your boss, or can you go check with the person who needs to make this decision. And I sit there going, well, you're talking to her. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Or it ain't getting there, even if there is somebody else higher, because, yeah... MARIANNA : Right, absolutely. Well, you know, the buck stops with me, and my company's bucks stop with me, and you know, it's a real shame when someone assumes that I'm there to show them to a conference room or serve them some water as opposed to I am the person they need to meet with and who will be making that decision. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, I'm sure you've never had that problem. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Well, you know, I think it's actually - she's probably in a rare situation. Most of us do have to go back and report in to other bosses. Even when you get in sometimes with the GM, they have to report to the CEO what they're doing. So actually, I - you don't want to let the person you're meeting with realize what you're doing, but you do want to plant soundbites for whoever you're meeting to be able to take to their higher-ups. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : And you also want to be able to follow up and make it very clear and concise so that they can communicate and advocate for your project on your behalf with the higher-ups. But you never want to let the person you're meeting with feel that that's what you're doing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In other words, it's important to point out somebody may pitch you for, I'm guessing, 10 or 15 minutes. You then have to pitch your boss for five minutes or three minutes. So you need to have that kernel of the idea that you can communicate very quickly. LORI GREINER : Exactly, and... LORI GREINER : other words, it's important to point out somebody may pitch you for, I'm guessing, 10 or 15 minutes. You then have to pitch your boss for five minutes or three minutes. So you need to have that kernel of the idea that you can communicate very quickly. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Exactly. And then my boss needs to go to our ad sales department, and then they need to go pitch sponsors. So, I mean, it gets shorter and shorter and more concise. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. It's always bad when the advertising or marketing people come back and say, what's this about? \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Interesting. Thanks very much for the call, Mary Anna. MARY ANNA : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Paula in Sebastopol, California: I've come up with some very original product ideas that I'm sure would be successful. In fact, many have actually been produced years later by someone else with great results for them. My quandary is how does one present these ideas to a company or an investor and protect it from being stolen? NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Lori Greiner, that's your bailiwick. LORI GREINER : Well, that is a difficult thing. I always recommend, if you can, to patent or protect whatever your idea is. If you can't, you have to make your best judgment. Sometimes people don't get anywhere because they sit on something, so afraid to reveal it. And yet, in the reverse, sometimes if you expose something too widely, you can risk losing it. So I think just be careful and be discriminating in who you reveal it to in the beginning. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And there are products and ideas that can be protected by patent. LORI GREINER : Yes, yes. Absolutely. There - it's something that a good intellectual property attorney could tell you whether or not they feel your product is protectable, and they can do searches in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to see if it is. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to - I'm sorry. You were going to say? BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Well, I think for entertainment, oftentimes people can become too precious with their ideas, and you've got to throw them out there because it's so fast-paced, and you can miss an entire trend because you're being too precious with the idea. No network executive is going to make their career or do a channel any favor if they're taking ideas from people. That's not the business that we're in. We're looking for talented people, and we're going to treat them well and as partners. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think I saw a TV series based on that very idea of people stealing ideas. Of course it didn't turn out too well for the executive involved. Anyway, Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt is senior vice president of global development and production for the National Geographic Channel, a panel member at the Realscreen Summit's \"So You Think You Can Pitch.\" Also with us, Lori Greiner, known as the Queen of QVC, a judge on ABC TV's \"Shark Tank.\" She holds about 110 U.S. and international patents and is also the host of \"Clever & Unique Creations\" on QVC TV.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Mike, and Mike is with us from Cottonwood in Utah. MIKE : Hello? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, Mike. You're on the air. MIKE : Hi. Thanks for having my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure. MIKE : Yeah. I just want to make a comment about the whole thievery of ideas. I'm a rock climber and an explorer, and I've pitched to people such as National Geographic and had some success with different companies in the outdoor world, but I've also seen my ideas come up a year or two later with other people. And I think it's pretty interesting because my ideas are places to go on the planet where no one's been to, to climb and to explore. Yet a year or two later after the idea is pitched, they're going to that exact spot. I just wonder if there's any comments on that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt? BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : You know, it's difficult. I think a lot of people don't realize the volume of material coming in to us and the number of people pitching. And oftentimes when you're pitching, you think this idea is so original. It's so unique. I will tell you that I got a pitch on lightning, and we did do a show five years later on lightning. But when - the original producer did call me and said, you know, I pitched you a lightning show five years ago, and I saw what was on air. And I was like, I've been pitched lightning shows a hundred times. And I think what's really important also in getting pitches is why this? Why now? What about this idea is relevant? And timing is a lot to it, but oftentimes it's the town. It's the person who you're talking to. But nobody is in the business of taking other people's ideas and just - it wouldn't do anybody any favors. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Mike, I'm not sure that's - that may be cold comfort. \n\n ###",

I think it's the unique situation I have. It's more about the location of planet and being an explorer. And it's just curious to know when you research the places for years and years, and then somebody else is going there after you've pitched it, when it's almost impossible to find the same contact and the same location on the planet. But anyways, thanks for taking my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Well, good luck, Mike. Hang in there. All right. Let's see if we go next to - this is Sonny(ph), Sonny with us from Grand Rapids. SONNY : Hi. Two quick points. First is, I'm the parent of two daughters, and one daughter gets her way far more often than the other without us really realizing it because she's a far better pitcher. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ha. SONNY : For instance, the other day we were trying to decide where to go to dinner, and my one daughter, who gets her way more often, said, Dad, you know, don't you love the steak at Texas Roadhouse? Well, my other daughter was just back there, pounding the feet, saying, McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's. SONNY : So we went to Texas. And the second point I'd like to make is one of the importance of creating an opportunity, and I'd like to actually demonstrate that by proposing that I send a sizzle reel about the Arizona cowboy, the modern Arizona cowboy, over to your National Geographic guest. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I'm sure she would find room for it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sizzle reel is about TV production proposals. It has nothing to do with steak. SONNY : That's right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK. Sonny, thanks very much. Good luck with that. SONNY : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Bye-bye. When, Lori Greiner, did you realize you were good at this? LORI GREINER : Oh, I think probably within the first year. I was fortunate enough to - with good pitches, which I think was very important - get into JCPenney nationwide and to get on the shopping TV network. But it was a very key thing that I did when I would call people because it's very difficult to get buyers at any store or shopping network to pick up the phone. LORI GREINER : And when I finally did, I had one second literally in which to grab their attention. And I would tell them that I had the greatest earring organizer ever. Nothing else was out there like it. Could I have five minutes of their time? I'd be in their town on thus and such a date. And by giving them a way in which to see me quickly and trying to intrigue them, almost every single one of them allowed me to see them for five minutes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hmm. Bridget Hunnicutt, I'm sure there was a time when you sat quaking in somebody's office and were ushered in and then realized, hey, I can sell this. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Oh. The first meeting was a disaster. I remember being very intimidated by the building I was going into, and I had a whole binder full of ideas that I was ready to pitch. And I went through - he was very generous with his time. He spent, like, an hour and a half, but I went through each pitch. And he said, no, because, no, because, no, because. So it's very disheartening. But I think that with persistence, that made a huge difference, and so it got better. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bridget Whalen Hunnicutt, now senior vice president of global development and production for the National Geographic Channel. Thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it. BRIDGET WHALEN HUNNICUTT : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also, Lori Greiner, good luck with the sharks. LORI GREINER : Oh, thank you. My first episode's February 10.

In one of the most shameful episodes in American history, more than 110,000 people were forced into concentration camps. A few, though, refused, including a then young man named Fred Korematsu. FRED KOREMATSU : I didn't think that the government would go as far as to include American citizens to be interned without a hearing. And then later on, they changed my draft card to 4-C, which is enemy alien. In those days, if you're an Asian, people automatically think you don't belong in this country. You're not an American, and I thought that was wrong. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Fred Korematsu became the subject of a test case that went all the way to the Supreme Court, but it ruled against him in 1944. Forty years later, a federal court overturned his conviction. In 1988, Congress voted to pay reparations for the surviving Japanese from the camps, and the government apologized. We want to hear from Japanese-Americans today. How did you hear about your family story during the war? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Fred Korematsu died in 2005. His daughter Karen Korematsu tells his story. She joins us today from member station KQED in San Francisco. Nice to have you with us today. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And yesterday was the second Fred Korematsu Day in California, and I'm sure that was quite emotional. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Yes, it was. It's wonderful to see how much my father's legacy has grown. And we've had several events around California and even as far as Florida in honor of my father's special day of recognition, Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitution. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Your father now recognized as a hero, a champion of civil rights, but I understand you didn't find out. He never talked about it when you were a kid. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : That's correct. I didn't find out about my father's Supreme Court case until I was a junior in high school. And it was in a social studies class when my friend Maya(ph) got up in front of all of us to give a book report, an oral book report, about the Japanese-American internment. Her book was called \"Concentration Camps USA.\" And when she was talking about the Japanese-American internment, it was a subject I had not heard of before. No one spoke about it in my family. And then she went on to say that someone had resisted the exclusion order and resulted in a famous Supreme Court case, Korematsu v. the United States. Well, I sat there and said that's my name. And the only thing I knew is that Korematsu is a very unusual Japanese name. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so you went home and asked your mom. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : I did and confronted her and said, you know, is this about my father because my friend Maya did not refer to my father's first name. So certainly, I thought it was some other black sheep of the family, not my father. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : And she says, no, it is. And I said, well, why didn't anyone tell me before? And she said, well, you'll have to wait until your father gets home. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what happened when you spoke with him? KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : He said that it happened a long time ago, and that what he did he felt was right, and the government was wrong, and it clearly was that simple to him. And I could see, however, the pain in his eyes, and I couldn't just go any further with any other questions. The irony to this story is that my brother, Ken, who is four years younger than I am, found out the same way in high school. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So he still didn't tell your little brother. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : No. My father said, you know, we're always very busy with our lives being Americans. I mean, that's what my father believed, was he wanted to get on and be an American and do all the activities that are privileged to us. And, you know, four years is a big gap difference in ages, and my brother was not even in high school yet. And I said, well, when are you going to tell me? He says, well, when you got older, and I said, well, I am older. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : But it clearly was not a subject that he felt comfortable talking about. NEAL CONAN, HOST : What was your reaction? I mean, at the same time, you're finding your father was a man who stood up for his principles, yet you were also finding out there's an important part of his story that he hadn't told you. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Yes, I didn't realize what it - at the time - what it meant to have a federal record. Certainly I asked my father if he could vote, and he could vote. But one - several years later he wanted to get his California real estate license, and he went through all the course and passed the test with flying colors, and then you fill out a form. And it - on that form there's a line item that says  have you ever been convicted of a felony. And he was, and so therefore he couldn't get his California state - real estate license. And it was so, so sad because he felt like he - he'd been let down by his country again. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let - we forget, yes, he resisted, but that meant that he was charged with a crime, convicted of a crime, and I guess served some of that - his time at the concentration camp. \n\n ###",

But he also felt responsible for the loss of his Supreme Court case in 1944 in regard to the rest of the Japanese and Japanese-Americans that had been incarcerated, and he carried around the weight of that shame for almost 40 years. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's implied in a documentary about your father that the people, the other Japanese-Americans in the camp, held him in disregard. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Yes. He was vilified from the moment that he resisted. And so when he went in to the - first it was at the Tanforan Racetrack, the assembly detention center in San Bruno, California, where everyone was to report. And no one wanted anything to do with him. They felt that if they associated with my father, that some harm might come to them or their families, and certainly he had disgraced my grandparents and our - and his family. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Karen Korematsu, daughter of Fred Korematsu, the civil rights activist whose legacy is being honored in California with Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and Constitution, and a special event later this week here in Washington, D.C. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Yes, we're very excited that we're going to have a special dedication and presentation of two of my father's photographs that were taken circa 1940. One is a headshot and the other one is him with his family and my uncles in the flower nursery in Oakland, California. And it's in a permanent exhibit called Struggle for Justice. And again, my father will be the first Asian-American to be in this permanent exhibition. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We would like to hear from Japanese-Americans today. How did you find out about your family's experience during the Second Word War? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And Michelle is on the line calling from Tulsa. MICHELLE : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. Go ahead, please. MICHELLE : Sure. My grandfather, his name is Makoto Miyamoto. And he said that when he was young, they had a choice. They could go to Japanese interment or join the Army to show that they were Americans, and they felt like they wanted to be Americans, so he joined the Army and he was part of the 442nd. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Famous battalion that fought in Italy. MICHELLE : Yes. Yes. He was very decorated. I have a wall, you know, covered with medals that he earned, and just recently in October he got the Congressional Medal of Honor. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That is an incredible honor and it is something - I believe that unit was more decorated than any comparable unit in the U.S. Army. MICHELLE : Yes, they were given the most dangerous missions, you know, and he has some amazing stories. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I wonder - I've spoken with many people who served in the Second World War, and they did not tell, a lot of them, their stories. For many years they just kept quiet. Was your grandfather that way? MICHELLE : He didn't tell many people, but he told his family all the stories. I've always known those stories, you know? So it was really neat. We're very proud of him, and he wasn't necessarily, you know, proud. He felt like it was their duty as Americans to do that, so - but we're very proud of him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Of course, as you should be, as you should be. I've had the great opportunity to meet several people who've received the Medal of Honor, and to a man they all said the people who deserve those awards, in fact, never came back, and they're just lucky to be representative of their units and the people who truly deserve to be honored. I'm sure your grandfather did wonderful things. MICHELLE : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thank you very much for the call, Michelle. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But it's interesting, Karen Korematsu, yes, went on to great achievement, but did not have much of a choice. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Well, yes. You know, also I'd like to point out that your caller said that, you know, her family knew about her grandfather. But there was really a code of silence among the Japanese-American community not to talk about their experience. They wanted just to get on with their lives and to prove that they were good Americans. In fact, I've had people ask me, you know, why did people willingly go into these camps? They felt that they - if they demonstrated their cooperation, that would prove their loyalty - pardon me - as Americans, and that's what was important to them. \n\n ###",

Your father's family relocated to Topaz in Utah, but many others were in camps all throughout the West, one of them at Heart Mountain, and an exhibit has opened up there. I wondered if you've had the chance to see it. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : No, I haven't. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Excuse me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Karen Korematsu, the daughter of Fred Korematsu, the civil rights champion whose legacy is being honored this week in California, as we mentioned, later this week in Washington, D.C. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's see if we go next to Dave. Dave with us from San Francisco. DAVE : Yes. Thank you. I'm chronologically challenged. I can't remember the exact year, but I was - it's just a great honor to some time back be granted the Fred Korematsu Award for Human Rights. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Really? DAVE : And it's just something that has stayed with me my entire life. Reading his story, listening to him whenever I could, it just - it's been a wonderful life-changing experience. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Can you give us a capsule explanation of the reason you were awarded this honor? DAVE : I was doing human rights work in Latin America, in particular late-'80s in Guatemala, and the surrounding environs, when there was, you know - I think future history books will (unintelligible) genocide back then, but certainly a lot of people were killed. A lot of people were both internally and externally displaced. Lives destructed forever. And during the time I had to spend weeks, sometimes months on end in the jungle, you know, tracking down refugees, things like that, and making sure that whatever help could be given was, whatever protection could be given was. And it was, you know, that work was all inspired by Mr. Korematsu, and his (unintelligible) achievements, which survive today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Karen Korematsu, that's another way your father's legacy is honored. KAREN KOREMATSU-HAIGH : Yes, it's amazing. When my father was still living, we would be going to different events. And there are always young people that would come up to him and say, oh, Mr. Korematsu, you're the reason that I went to law school, or Mr. Korematsu, you're the reason that I'm involved in social justice. And clearly that's what my father had hoped for, that his story would be an inspiration and a lesson to - for others. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Dave. DAVE : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see, we go next to Marissa. Marissa with us from San Jose. MARISSA : Hi. My grandfather, his name is actually Ralph Horio, and he was in the Camp Tule Lake. But in San Jose he was a farmer, and he had orchards on the Chaboya farm. And he also was - him and the rest of family was actually part of the baseball teams that was going on in the internment camps. My grandfather actually helped write a book called \"Asahi to Zebra\" with a man named Ralph Pearce. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I think I read part of that book. It was about a young Japanese baseball star growing up in one of those camps, and the difficulties trying to get him placed in professional leagues. MARISSA : Yeah. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. I think I did read that book. That's interesting. And your grandfather worked on that, and what did he do after that in the rest of his life? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : In a recent presidential Republican debate, Turkey - under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan - was described as a place where the murder rate against women has increased 1,400 percent, where press freedom has declined to the level of Russia, and where Turkey's prime minister has embraced Hamas and threatened military force against both Israel and Cyprus. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Mostly true, notes Washington Post columnist Jackson Diehl. But he also goes to point out that Turkey's government just installed an advanced radar to track missiles from Iran, joined the NATO intervention in Libya, hosts the Syrian opposition, and amended its constitution to expand rights for women, ethnic minorities and unions - all at a complicated and sometimes infuriating place, Diehl writes. But if we are lucky, Turkey may become a model for the Islamic governments in Iraq, Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you have questions about Turkey's role in the region and its value as a model, give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. Jackson Diehl is deputy editorial page editor at The Post and writes a biweekly foreign affairs column and joins us from a studio at the newspaper. Nice to have you back. JACKSON DIEHL : Oh, it's my pleasure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you acknowledge that Turkey as hardly the perfect ally. JACKSON DIEHL : No, it's not. It's been a very mixed bag. There have been ups and downs. And the Obama administration has really struggled with the Erdogan government. But on the whole, they feel like they're reaching a positive place, and some of the evidence shows that they are. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And some of the evidence, yet that recitation at the beginning, that's also true. JACKSON DIEHL : That's true. I wouldn't vouch for the murder rate about women, but it is true that they have launched a lot of crackdowns domestically against journalists, against opponents in the military, against other secular forces. And they've had a very rocky relationship with Israel. I don't think the threat to use force against Israel should be taken seriously, but a relationship that once was very close has deteriorated very much. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A relationship once very close with Syria has also deteriorated. JACKSON DIEHL : And I think that speaks well of Erdogan. He cultivated Bashar al-Assad, sent delegations there, declared that Syria was going to be a close ally of Turkey. When the revolution in Syria started, he first supported Assad. He sent people there to talk to Assad about reforming. When Assad refused reform, he switched sides. He's completely switched sides now. In fact, he's not only hosting the Syrian opposition, but he's hosting some of what's called the Free Syrian Army, the opposition army that's starting to coalesce. JACKSON DIEHL : And I've heard that Turkey is supplying that army with weapons. So Erdogan has completely come around to the other side on that issue, and it shows that in the Arab Spring as a whole, he is backing the forces of liberal change. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, interesting. If a NATO ally is backing a irredentist force of a neighboring country, well, that raises all kinds of questions, doesn't it? JACKSON DIEHL : Yeah. That's not irredentist so much as it's an opposition force. It's a rebel force. It's an insurgent force fighting against a dictatorship. And it's really not different from backing the Libyan rebels, which NATO supported, again, with Turkey's participation. I think the difference here is that Turkey's the neighbor, and they have the capacity to do something that the rest of the NATO allies, probably in a perfect world, would like to do, but don't feel that they can. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And did in Libya with the authorization of a Security Council resolution, which does not exist at the moment. But anyway, moving on from other aspects of that, if we're lucky, you say, places like Egypt and Iraq will use Turkey as a model. JACKSON DIEHL : Yeah. You hope that that's what will happen. I mean, there's, you know, there's a different sort of Islamic movement coming out in the Middle East. We're used to seeing Islamic movements in power in places like Iran that are fundamentalists, very hostile to the West, or else movements that are associated somehow with terrorism, like Hezbollah and Hamas. Now we're seeing a kind of Islamic movement that has sworn off violence, that has a much more - is much willing to cooperate with the West and is operating in this kind of uncertain middle ground and are sort of up for play. JACKSON DIEHL : They could cooperate with us. They could be hostile to us. And it's going to be a matter of trying to work with them and see what we can get out of them, instead of knowing from the start that they're going to be hostile. NEAL CONAN, HOST : One of the great things that we worry about in both Iraq and in Egypt is a new government emergence there with a parliamentary majority clearly dominated by Islamists is minority rights. And Turkey's record on that is not outstanding. JACKSON DIEHL : No, although again it's been mixed. And the Erdogan government has been, certainly, initially, more supportive of Kurdish rights and Turkey than was the previous military governments. But recently, they've been tougher on - certainly on the armed wing of the Kurds and has carried out attacks on Iraq against that wings, and they've put some Kurdish legislators in jail. So they - again, it's a very mixed bag on the whole, probably somewhat better than the previous military governments. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's interesting, most of the places we are talking about in terms of the Arab Spring were once dominated by Turkey during the Ottoman Empire. JACKSON DIEHL : And I think people in the region are very aware of that, and Turkey itself is very aware of that. They have to be careful about that. They're a little bit like we are in Latin America. People are very wary of them. They don't want to be a Turkish colony. They don't want to be dominated by Istanbul. And so there's a - Turkey has to be somewhat subtle and careful about not appearing to dictate to these countries. \n\n ###",

At the same time, it should be persuasive that Turkey is more and more prosperous - not prosperous on the European level, not yet, but its middle class is advancing. JACKSON DIEHL : That's exactly right, and I think actually that's one of the most important things that Turkey has to offer, because in a lot of these countries, they are struggling with what their economic policy is going to be after this revolution. That's particularly true of Egypt, which doesn't know whether it wants to be a state-dominated economy, whether it wants to be - go back, return to a kind of populism where - what direction they want to go. And here they have the model of Turkey, which was a basket case 10 years ago in 2001, which had to turn to the IMF in desperation, and now is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. JACKSON DIEHL : Their GNP has tripled in the last 10 years. So they have a very important model to offer Egypt, in particular, but also other countries in the region that are going to have to find a way to grow economically in order for these revolutions to succeed in the long run. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's - we're talking with Jackson Diehl, our deputy editorial page editor for The Washington Post. He contributes to the PostPartisan blog, as well. And let's get a caller on the line. Kirsten is with us, Kirsten from Bonita Springs in Florida. KIRSTEN : Hi. I lived over in Turkey for a few months of the year for a few years ago, and I married into a well-to-do Turkish family. And I wanted to have your speaker address the women's rights issues. Having spent so much time over there, I never felt that I was - that I had to be afraid of acting or dressing any way different than I did in the United States. And I know a lot of people don't understand Turkish culture, but I didn't feel like would - was being held down or threatened in any way by being Western. JACKSON DIEHL : Well, yeah. Turkey's very different from other countries in the region in that respect. Now, some people in Turkey do worry about what the Erdogan government's intentions are about women. One of the most - the signal initiatives of this government was to try and permit women to wear headscarves in universities, which may sound like a trivial issue, but in Turkey, it was a matter of enormous symbolism because they had been banned for many years. And when they launched this initiative, it almost prompted the military to try and carry out a coup, and eventually Erdogan backed off. JACKSON DIEHL : And, in fact, he's struck a very balanced approach so far. They changed the Turkish constitution actually to expand some rights for women, making it easier to get a divorce, for example. So they've - they're taking very much a middle road. KIRSTEN : And I think the whole aspect of wearing the hijab was more - in trying to ban that, I think they were just trying to empower the women who maybe lived in the lower classes or the more eastern parts of the country who were more tied to those types of habits. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well. Yeah, we do we have to understand the history of this particular version of Turkey arising from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire under the great general and then leader of the country Ataturk, who was militantly anti-Islam. JACKSON DIEHL : That's right, exactly. He made secularism sort of the religion of Turkey, and he installed the military as its ultimate defender. So it's been long road for this Justice and Development party of Turkey just to introduce Islamic ideas back into the public discourse again. Erdogan was once in prison simply for reading a poem that had an Islamic tenor to it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Kirsten, thanks very much for the call. KIRSTEN : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as we look at this history, that is something that is not the case elsewhere in the Middle East. I mean, you could make the argument that that was the case to some degree in a place like Syria or Iraq, but no longer. JACKSON DIEHL : Yes, that's right, and then this history of secularism. And, of course, the military governments in those places did consider themselves secular, but they had the effect of strengthening Islamic movements by trying to repress them. So one reason that the Muslim Brotherhood is as strong as it is in Egypt and as strong as it is in Syria is that the governments there tried so hard to repress them. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is also the question of, as you mentioned, the change in policy towards Israel. And yes, there was the incident with the convoy that was trying to break the blockade of Gaza and the Israeli commandos who attacked and killed some people on a Turkish vessel. This convoy was all Turkey's idea, I think it's fair to say. Nevertheless, Turkey now insists that unless Israel apologizes and lifts the blockade, there can be no improvement in relations. JACKSON DIEHL : Yes, that's true. They - and they went through extensive negotiations last year, trying to reach some kind of accord. And I think the one thing you can say is the Turkish government was proved fairly flexible in those negotiations, and they reached a point where they had a deal that the majority of the Israeli Cabinet, I think, was in favor of accepting. At the last minute, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided not to accept it. But they did get pretty close to striking a deal. And I think it's also worth noting, there's been no other convoy sent from Turkey to Gaza since then. So I think in the long run, the Turks realized they do not really want to rupture with Israel, or probably I think there is some chance they will get - they will improve that relationship in the next couple of years. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet there are elements at least that believe Turkey cannot improve its role in the rest of the Middle East and improve relations with Israel at the same time. JACKSON DIEHL : Yeah, it's a balancing act. They have to strike. And, of course, you know, that's why some part of it depends on what happens in the peace process. If there's movement in the peace process, then it's easier for someone like Erdogan to be friendly towards Israel. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is also a question that you raised in the article, in the op-ed piece in The Washington Post, and that is the degree to which the - Erdogan, the prime minister, has been a confidant of President Obama. JACKSON DIEHL : Yeah, it's one of the most remarkable things. You know, I wrote a piece a couple of years ago pointing out that Obama had relatively few foreign friends, that he didn't tend to develop strong personal relationships with other leaders. And since then, one of the changes in that has been his relationship with this man, Erdogan. \n\n ###",

Public documents show Freddie Mac sought to make gains through complex securities which would make money for Freddie Mac, but homeowners with high-interest rate loans would not be able to qualify for refinancing. This is not illegal, but it does raise questions about a conflict of interest within a federally-owned company that is supposed to make getting a mortgage easier. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Chris Arnold is a correspondent here at NPR. He worked with ProPublica on the investigation of Freddie Mac, which came out this morning. He's with us here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you in Washington. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Thank you, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also here in the studio is NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. And, Marilyn, good to have you back on the program. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Hi, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Chris, let's start with you. So how does a large taxpayer-owned company get involved in betting against refinanced mortgages, which everybody says would be great not only for the mortgage holders but for the economy? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Right. Well, I can see how you would think that. Part of what you need to understand to understand the story is that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are kind of two companies inside of themselves. So take Freddie Mac, it does a guarantee business, which most people know them for, you know, you get a home loan, they guarantee the loan, they allow the mortgage market to work well that way. That was sort of what their mission was built around, you know, going back decades, that they help foster homeownership. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : But at the same time, they also have what could be described as a hedge fund inside of the same company, and they make all kinds of investments. So it's within that sort of hedge fund side of the business that we found this was going on. And I was working on this with ProPublica and a reporter there, Jesse Eisinger, who we should mention, too. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Of course. So the way this works is that hedge fund part was betting against homeowners refinancing. In other words, if you're paying 7 or 8 percent on your mortgage, they are betting that you will not be able to refinance, therefore you will be paying a lot more on your mortgage payments every month. While it might be in everybody else's interest that the mortgage rate come down to what it is, three and a half, 4 percent. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Right. And one way to think about this is let's say you're going to buy a house, Neal, and you want to borrow $100,000. So Marilyn and I... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Cheap house. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Well, yeah, in D.C., imagine... CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : ...this is in another part of the country. So, you know, it's public radio. We have to do what we can do. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : But - so Marilyn and I loaned you the $100,000, and you're paying 7 percent interest. And then, you decide, well, jeez, look, I can get three and a half percent or three and seven-eighths. I'm going to refinance. And that's a little sad for Marilyn and I because we don't get the 7 percent interest payment anymore, but we do get our $100,000 back, right? When you refinance, you pay off... NEAL CONAN, HOST : I refinance with the ABC Mortgage Company, and they pay you the $100,000? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Exactly. Right. So that is very different than what Freddie Mac has done with these investments. Because what Freddie Mac did is they owned these mortgages, but they sold off their right to collect that principal. And all they have the right to do now in these trades is to collect that 7 percent interest. Does that make sense? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, I guess, it makes sense for Freddie Mac, and that 7 percent that they're collecting, that's why they want to make this short-term bet that a lot of people will not be able to refinance - President Obama spoke about last week. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Right, right. And the thing is since they have given up the right to collect the principal, that's all they have, right? So if you stop paying the 7 percent and I'm Freddie Mac, I lose everything. I mean, I don't get any money from you. I don't get the $100,000 back. And so it's a more concentrated way to invest in the mortgage market and it - bond traders say the only reason you would do that is if you were betting against homeowners being able to refinance. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And, Neal, could I just make a point here? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Marilyn Geewax, go ahead. \n\n ###",

The thing that is unusual about this is Wall Street is full of hedge funds and big investors, and some of them go broke, and some of them make tons of money. But wait a minute, Freddie Mac is owned by the taxpayers these days. So it is... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Didn't those taxpayers just bail it out a couple of years ago? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Yeah. So in 2008, when there was the financial crisis, it's a long story, but fundamentally, the taxpayers now own Freddie Mac. So one might wonder why taxpayers are involved in acting like a hedge fund.

Freddie Mac's role is to facilitate good mortgages. If it's betting on the short term that people would not be able to refinance, is it blocking people's ability to refinance? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Well, and this is something, you know, we want to be careful got to overstate here. And what Freddie Mac says is there is a firewall between the investment part of its business and the part of its business that sets policy for homeowners and for refinancing, some things like that. So they say whatever might be going on on those two businesses, it's a coincidence of - you know, whatever, that it's not a concerted, calculated effort to profit by, you know, doing wrong by homeowners. But even at best, what our reporting has shown is that they're making a calculated bet against homeowners being able to refinance, and that - you know, is that an appropriate bet for a company that can control homeowners' ability to refinance to be making? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Is it, Marilyn, a legal bet? There seems to be a conflict of interest. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And there are people in Congress now who are starting to wonder about whether or not this should be changed, at the moment, as the laws are structured, and as Freddie Mac's mission is, which is to not go broke. You know, it's supposed to be a solvent organization doing its business, but it's also supposed to be helping homeowners. This structure could be called into question. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And one senator, for example today, Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, sent a letter to the president urging him - I'm quoting from the letter - he says, \"to put an end to these practices immediately, to ensure that the investment decisions being made by Freddie Mac are in line with the intent of Congress and the greater needs of our economy.\" So we also spoke today with Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, who's also interested in reforming Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. So I think there are people on Capitol Hill who are starting to really ponder: What is the structure of these organizations and what role do they play? What's appropriate for them to do? And this is just sort of an interesting look at conflicts of interest. We are not, in any way - our story has not said that it is illegal, just that it raises questions about how it functions. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, you did quote Alan Boyce in your story, a former bond trader who's been involved in efforts to push for more refinancing of home loans. Freddie Mac, he said, prevented households from being able to take advantage of today's mortgage rates and then bet on it. You say, well, Freddie Mac has two arms, one, the left hand, did not necessarily know what the right hand is doing. However, they seemed to be miraculously working in concert. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Well, and the timing of some of these, too, you know, lending would be - or credit would be tightened. One example was Thanksgiving evening or somewhere around there, and then very soon after that, some trades were made that were betting against homeowners. So, you know, but again, we can't prove that the left and the right arms were working together. What is being referenced in that quote, as well, is that Freddie Mac has been making it harder for homeowners to refinance. They've been putting additional fees in place, additional restrictions. Some of that is justified. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : The whole lending community has been making things tighter since the housing market collapsed, but more and more economists, you know, are saying, look, the pendulum's probably swung too far. We should - especially when it comes to refinancing. We've got hundreds of - we got tens of millions of homeowners who are stuck in higher-interest-rate loans. Wouldn't it be good for them, wouldn't it be good for the economy if they had some more money in their pocket to spend? You know, let's let some more of those people refinance. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Neal, if I could just make one point. The important thing here, in all of this discussion of these big terms - hedge funds and Freddie Mac and some of these unfamiliar things - the issue here is the housing crisis. That's something we all know a lot about. It's affected everyone in this country, and particularly in states like Florida, California, Arizona, Nevada. These states have been hit hard because of this housing crisis. Many people have homes that are underwater. They want to refinance. The economy has really been slowed by the housing crisis. So all of this is not just a strange academic discussion about what is the role of a government-sponsored blah, blah, blah, you know. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Quasi-governmental corporation, yeah. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : It's about: Can we end this housing crisis? How do we get to the end of what has been a nightmare for the country? And would - is Freddie Mac part of the solution, or is it sort of part of the problem right now because of its structure? And I think we've seen in the Florida primary the topic of Freddie Mac last week, listening to the debates, how many times that name came up. It's been a big issue, because when you're talking Florida, you're talking housing. People care about this topic, and it's not some esoteric, weird discussion among academics and investment bankers. It's something that touches millions of people's lives. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get a caller in on the conversation. Let's start with Jeff, Jeff with us from Pleasant Hill in California. JEFF : Good afternoon. First time caller, many years listener. And this is a subject that I am - I'm almost speechless that I'm able to talk to you about this today because I've been following this for many, many months. My spouse and I purchased a home here in the Bay Area in 2008. It dropped 40 percent in value in the last three-and-a-half years. We both are employed. We have excellent credit. We've been trying to refinance, but basically, they're asking us - and our current mortgage holder - is to re-buy our house a second time, to come up with up to 75 and up to $80,000 to make up for the lost equity. I've been following this program last summer. I've been contacting my mortgage company weekly. Finally, two weeks ago, my mortgage company said that the rules are finally in place, and we might be able, might be able to refinance at the current rate starting after February 6th. JEFF : The issue is Freddie Mac keeps changing the rules. There isn't any teeth into the programs. There's no penalty involved for people like us who cannot refinance because, if we have to get an appraisal, our house is worth less than what we paid for it three years ago. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Underwater - that's the underwater mortgage. And, Chris Arnold... CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Yeah. This gets to the heart of one of the big issues that this story raises. And, you know, there have been some baby step - I guess you might call it - efforts to allow underwater borrowers and other borrowers to get these lower rates - if, as the caller says, you know, they have good credit, they've got jobs, they can pay. It's just here they are stuck, you know, in a higher interest rate. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : President Obama has talked about this. Lots of economists have talked about this. There's a program called HARP. I believe it's the Home Affordable Refinancing Program. \n\n ###",

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : So, you know, the idea is here we could help millions of people. So far, I think just about a million people have been helped through that program, but there are 10 or 20 million other people out there who haven't been able to access it. And so the question implicitly of the story is, well, you know, it certainly can't help that there are conflicts of interests within these companies that are at the heart of allowing these people - you know, if Freddie Mac is making bets against homeowners like this, you know, is that helping things? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeff, how much difference would it make to you if you were able to refinance at, say, three and three quarters? I think Jeff has left us, so we thank him for his call. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Well, this is really the heart of the issue, too, Neal, that what we're talking about when we say there's refinancing. If you think, hey, I'm renter. I don't care. What's it to me? It matters to the economy for this reason: right now, we have a lack of demand. Consumers haven't been spending enough money, and that hurts people at restaurants. It hurts retailers. It hurts car dealers. People need more money in their pockets, and this is one way that you could actually boost people's incomes. Now, perhaps they'll use that money. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Let's say you save $500 a month. Maybe all you're going to do is pay down your dentist bill and your credit card. Maybe that doesn't stimulate the economy tomorrow morning, but it does help that dentist's office get the bill paid. And it does start to free up room on your credit card so that by summer, maybe you can take a vacation. Really, to heal the economy, it has to start with this housing problem. NEAL CONAN, HOST : NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax, also with us NPR correspondent Chris Arnold. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And a similar email from Allen, who emails: My wife and I have credit scores that our mortgage broker has termed beyond excellent. Still having trouble getting a mortgage because of retail lenders' concern over their ability to resell our mortgage to Fannie or Freddie. So even if you're talking to the bank down the street, Chris Arnold, you're also talking to Fannie and Freddie. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : You know, Fannie and Freddie, they're kind of the great eyes behind the curtain. You know, I mean, you don't see them. You might interface with somebody else. But, yes, they control, essentially, the entire mortgage market right now. You know, in the wake of the housing debacle, everything is going to Fannie and Freddie (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : I got a lot of emails and calls along these lines. From Ricky: What's the role of Dodd-Frank? And this - that, of course, the financial reform package that was passed in the previous Congress. Does this not stop it? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Well, there's a lot we could talk about there and probably don't want to get into. But one thing is, lenders will say that Dodd-Frank makes it harder for them to refinance people. So they say this new regulation is making things tougher, you know, but we could have a whole show on the merits of that claim, probably. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get another caller in. Let's go to Richard, and Richard with us from Wichita. RICHARD : Yes. Real quick question. It was commented that Freddie Mac sold off the rights to collect the principal in the home loans, and I would like to know who bought those rights and what percentage of the principal they paid for the right to collect on those - on the principal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Any idea, Chris? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Those are all good questions. The takeaway in all of that is that the - those rights were sold off into the market, so investors all over the world potentially could have bought them. Critics of these deals also say that, look, if Freddie Mac had just gone out and sold these mortgages in a simple fashion, it would have gotten more money for them than it got by cutting them up into 20 pieces and selling them the way that it did. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But this quick question is: investors? CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Investors. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Investors bought these. Richard, sorry if we can't be more precise than that... NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...but that's kind of the way these commodities work. We thank you for the call. And more on this story later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Chris Arnold, thanks very much for your time. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE : Thanks, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : NPR's Chris Arnold worked with ProPublica on the investigation of Freddie Mac's bet against homeowners.

I'm Jennifer Ludden in Washington, sitting in for Neal Conan. In Nigeria, long-held tensions between Christians and Muslims are flaring again. An Islamist sect called Boko Haram, suspected of having links to al-Qaeda, killed at least 185 people in the past week with coordinated bombings in the northern city of Kano. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is promising to crack down. He's fired his police chief and six deputies. Nearly 200 people have been arrested. But the president faces criticism for his handling of the conflict. NPR correspondent Ofeibea Quist-Arcton joins us in a moment. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : If you have questions about what's happening in Nigeria, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address, talk@npr.org, and you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Later in the program, a practical wedding. But first, Nigeria. NPR foreign correspondent Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is based in West Africa, and she's been reporting from Kano this week and joins us from there. Ofeibea, hello. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : Greetings from Kano, Kano which is a historic, ancient city. And I must say right from the start, Jennifer, that Muslims and Christians here in Kano have lived together side by side for generations with very little trouble. So the communities here are very troubled by what has happened over the past week. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And can you give us a sense, Ofeibea - is it mostly Muslim there? What's the share of the population? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : In Kano, in Nigeria (technical difficulties) Africa's most populous nation, and we're talking of a nation of 140 million-plus. You have Muslims living in all parts, Christians living in all parts. You have Christians who come from the south, (unintelligible) Christians. You have Muslims. You have Christians who come from the north. So this is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : Here in Kano, all the communities have lived, as I've said, side by side for generations. So this city is reeling in shock because of what has happened. The bombings claimed by Boko Haram, whose name in Hausa, which is the lingua Franca, Hausa - the lingua franca here in northern Nigeria, means Western education, is haram, which means forbidden, sinful, according to Islam. So that already tells you that this is an anti-Western group that has especially been an anti-government group since its inception. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : It's very much in recent times that it seems to be targeting more and more churches, for example, places where Christians gather. But Muslims also have targeted, as have the security forces and state institutions, especially the federal government of Nigeria. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Now, President Goodluck Jonathan has traveled up to Kano and said that these kind of bombings that Boko Haram has carried out are a new thing for them, and there have been accusations, as we've said, of ties to al-Qaeda and so forth. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Today in an interview with Reuters, the president called on Boko Haram to come forward and explain themselves. What's he hoping here? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : Well, he says that they should identify themselves and say why they're resisting, why they're confronting the government, why they're destroying property and especially innocent people. And he said only then will there be a basis for dialogue, and that's in quotations, we will dialogue. Let us know your problems, he's saying to Boko Haram, and we will solve your problem. But if they don't identify themselves, who will we dialogue with? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : And you have many in Nigeria who are saying that dialogue is the only way forward. The fact that there is now this menace, this threat that is so violent and is so deadly - just in the first month this year we're talking more than 250 people - that talking is the only way forward, that a security crackdown, and that from the government has been the way up till now, to clamp down on people that they suspect of being militants, that is not going to work. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : You need to deal with the root problems here in Nigeria, and that's not between Christians and Muslims. It's about poverty. It's about people who feel marginalized, isolated, not protected in any way by the government, not able to get jobs, not having opportunity, especially unemployed young men who are able to be manipulated by either unscrupulous politicians or unscrupulous religious leaders, be they Muslim or Christian. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : That, many Nigerians will tell you, is the real problem here, that Boko Haram, whether they're assisted by al-Qaeda or other, in inverted commas, terrorist groups in the region, that's why they have taken up arms against the state, that they feel that they've got nothing to lose. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And didn't President Jonathan also allude to that today in his interview with Reuters and suggesting some kind of program to help unemployed youth? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : Indeed, but people are saying, you know, before we get to that, deal with the issues. Meet these people first. President Jonathan has talked about the current crisis in Nigeria. He's likened it to the Biafran civil war here in Nigeria when a million - or is it three million, I'm not quite sure - people lost their lives at the end of the '60s and the early '70s. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : It was a brutal, brutal period in Nigeria's history. More recently also, Nigeria has suffered from the conflict in the oil-producing area. This is a country that produces crude oil, that supplies the U.S. with about an eighth of its crude oil imports. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : We had militants there, heavily armed, as are the Islamist militants here in Nigeria, who literally waged a war, a campaign of sabotage against the government, against the oil industry. It was only when they came to the negotiating table, and an amnesty was offered to the militant leaders, that that particular problem stopped, or at least it was drastically reduced. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : That's why people are saying whoever these people are in Boko Haram (technical difficulties) you must sit down and talk to them. It's the only way this problem can be resolved in Nigeria. \n\n ###",

We're getting the best line we can. We're also joined by former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell here in Studio 3A. Welcome to you. JOHN CAMPBELL : Thank you very much, it's good to be here. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : You're also a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and you've been writing about this situation this week, kind of with a pretty depressing take on affairs. How do you see this latest flare-up of this longtime strife here? JOHN CAMPBELL : Part of the difficulty is that Boko Haram is not an organization in the traditional sense of the word. It does not have a charismatic leader. It doesn't have a politburo. It doesn't have an agreed-upon manifesto. It appears to be highly diffuse. It has many different strands. JOHN CAMPBELL : In some respects it resembles a movement more than almost anything else. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Does it have popular support in Nigeria? I mean, we've just seen a U.N. report recently, says there's evidence that it has employed mercenaries from Chad. I mean, is this an outside group, an inside group? JOHN CAMPBELL : I'd be very careful. Boundaries in northern Nigeria are extremely fluid. Does it have support? Movements like this normally have relatively few activists, a larger number of sympathizers, and a larger number still of those who acquiesce to what is being done. JOHN CAMPBELL : And in fact, when the focus is on attacks on the police, who are nearly universally hated in Nigeria, the military, and the federal government, none of these institutions enjoy any great popularity. Your correspondent made, I think, an extremely important point when she was talking about the general sense of alienation, the general sense of problems, huge problems that are not being addressed. JOHN CAMPBELL : This, as it were, is the kind of oxygen that fuels something like Boko Haram. The government's approach has been to treat Boko Haram as a security issue. More police, more soldiers. The police in many cases are poorly trained. Police in Nigeria are a national institution, which means that the actual policeman on the ground is almost certainly not from that particular area. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Which you've written is done on purpose so they are seen as impartial, but there's a double-edged sword there. JOHN CAMPBELL : There's a double-edged sword there, that they don't really understand sometimes the nature of the people that they're policing. And according to human rights organizations, the police and the military have in fact been responsible for a significant number of killings in the north. JOHN CAMPBELL : What of course this does is it even further alienates a population that is already feeling marginalized. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Let me ask Ofeibea, before we go to the break here, Ofeibea, the - I understand the new police chief has now taken position. Is that right? And how is he being received? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : It was with immediate effect, and we'll see (technical difficulties) come in for huge criticism, masses of criticism that it is not protecting the people. The ambassador has spoken about how the government has been throwing security at this problem rather than dialogue at the problem, and many Nigerians, and we were at a truck park, at a bus park yesterday when literally dozens of frightened people were fleeing Kano. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : One woman we spoke to has lived here all her life. She was born here, married here, has children here. She said I'm going. I don't feel safe. You know, the ground was shaking when we heard those bombs. We don't feel safe here anymore, we don't feel that the government can protect us. Our only way is to leave, to go somewhere else in this country. Kano is no longer safe. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : We are talking about the tensions and violence in Nigeria. We'll have more with NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton from Nigeria, and also former Ambassador John Campbell coming up. We'll also talk with an activist from Nigeria.

JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Jennifer Ludden. Nigeria has long faced challenges from corruption, an economy that relies on oil exports and simmering ethnic and religious tensions, tensions made evident in the recent series of bombings by Boko Haram, the militant Islamist sect whose name translates roughly to Western education is sinful.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### ALASAKOMI : Hi, how are you Jennifer? JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Good. Go right ahead. ALASAKOMI : Ofeibea, I was going to ask you, the way you're looking at the situation right now in Nigeria, would you characterize Boko Haram as being a local terrorist or a local gang who has an international agenda on their mind? That's my first question. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Ofeibea? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : I missed your name, I'm sorry, but I would say that it's very hard to characterize Boko Haram. They started in 2002(ph)  as a homegrown outfit that targeted especially Nigeria's security forces. It was the army and the police. It was the places where the security forces take their leisure, beer taverns, parlors where alcohol is served. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : And it was almost exclusively in Madugli, which is a remote northeastern town, and that is where we believe Boko Haram was born. Now, when its leader, Yusuf Mohammed, was killed in police custody in 2009, that is when Boko Haram - and I say that in inverted commas because that is what we're calling them. They have a much longer name, and sometimes people speak for them, but often not. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : That is when they stepped up their campaign and included all sorts of targets, still the security, still the government, but especially since the inauguration of President Goodluck Jonathan last year, after the election, the campaign has intensified. And in the past few months and weeks, we have seen even churches targeted. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : But in August, the U.N. headquarters in the capital, Abuja, were bombed, deadly killings, and that was a suicide bomber. We've also seen police headquarters, the federal police headquarters in the capital, Abuja, attacked also, this time by a suicide bomber in a car. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : So definitely Boko Haram's tactics have become more sophisticated as the campaign has intensified, and there are those who say is it because a Christian southerner, President Goodluck Jonathan, is now in charge, that perhaps disgruntled politicians in the North who feel that their candidate, who died, should have been replaced by another candidate from the North, are they the ones behind Boko Haram? OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : President Jonathan himself has said that he feels that members of his administration across government and in the security forces are backers and sympathizers of Boko Haram. So there are many, many unanswered questions. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, thank you for that call. Ambassador Campbell, you've suggested that a political settlement is needed here but that anyone would require a restructuring that may not be possible. JOHN CAMPBELL : Well, all things are possible. It simply may be extremely difficult and extremely difficult for the people who traditionally have run Nigeria. There are some things that could be done in the short term. One is to reduce the - either reduce the security presence in the north or greatly improve its quality. JOHN CAMPBELL : Secondly, there could be a campaign of reaching out to the North, more frequent speeches by the president, an indication that the deep-seated grievances the North has are being heard and that they will be addressed. And then I think it would be extremely useful at this point if some kind of dramatic development initiative were to be announced, focused on a place with a large population like Kano. JOHN CAMPBELL : It's easy for us sitting here in Washington to forget just how immense northern Nigeria is. Kano has at least seven million people. We're talking enormous numbers of people in a part of the world which suffers from desertification as the Sahara moves down, under-investment in agriculture, the collapse of the railway network, traditional agriculture exports - cotton and ground nuts largely gone, the manufacturing sector based on textiles also largely gone. JOHN CAMPBELL : As rural impoverishment increases, more and more people flee into the towns, essentially looking for work. Very often, these are in fact children. These are people who can be eight, nine, 10 years old, and you see them - you see them on the streets of Kano begging. JOHN CAMPBELL : So when we're talking about deep-seated grievances, we are talking about something that has multiple causes. Yes, the political dimension is very important, and the sense particularly amongst northern political figures that somehow or another the presidency ought to be theirs and it is not, that is certainly a very important factor. JOHN CAMPBELL : But there is also a much deeper factor that looks at the increasing marginalization of northern Nigeria, as well as its impoverishment. The differences in level of development between the North and the South now are really quite dramatic. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And Ofeibea, this sense of economic deprivation really came to fore in recent weeks. The president tried to eliminate a longtime subsidy for fuel in this country that produces oil but has to import its own. Tell us what happened then. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : Bedlam. It was absolute mayhem. Nigerians almost unanimously said absolutely not, hell no - excuse my language, Jennifer - and they were down on those streets in the tens of thousands: Muslims, Christians, Northerners, Southerners, Easterners, Westerners, those from the center of the country, except of course the immediate supporters of President Goodluck Jonathan, saying, hey, look at  you fat cats in Abuja, in the government, in the national assembly, in all the official positions, getting huge salaries from the oil wealth of Nigeria whilst this country's 140 million, most of the people are impoverished. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : And now you get rid of the fuel subsidy, which means that not only gasoline goes up, but food, transportation, everything. How can you do this to us and overnight, on New Year's Day? The government's argument is that Nigeria can't afford $9 billion on food(ph)  subsidies.

Don't just decide overnight that you are going to make our lives even more impossible. So there was - it was Nigeria in unity saying no to its leaders. OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE : And I think that was a big shock for President Goodluck Jonathan and his government, although of course they have a point. Subsidies cost money. They say they were going to use the money for development. Nigerians say no, prove to us that you would do that. That's not what we've seen is the reality in the past. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Let's hear from another caller here. Brian is on the line in Salt Lake City. Hi there, Brian. BRIAN : Hi, my roommate actually just returned from Nigeria. He's a Nigerian refugee. And he was in the Southern region of Ogoni, and he was attacked, and someone that was with him was kidnapped, one of his relatives. And I was just wondering how the instability in general in Nigeria has led to greater unrest and the rise of (unintelligible) criminals taking the opportunity of the instability (unintelligible). JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, let's see. Ambassador Campbell, do you want to address that? Thank you, John - thank you, Brian. JOHN CAMPBELL : It is true that there's a good deal of that. And it is to be found in all parts of the country. I would like to return to a very important point that your Kano correspondent made. She made the point early in the conversation to the effect that Christians and Muslims have lived next to each other in Kano for 1,000 years, and this is perfectly correct. It is also perfectly correct that in some parts of the country, religious tension between Christians and Muslims has been high. JOHN CAMPBELL : What was really significant about the fuel subsidy strike and also about the demonstrations that went on parallel to those strikes, what was really striking was the way Nigerians united across religious and ethnic lines, so that in the city of Kano, for example, the informal Muslim police were protecting Christian churches during the strike. Christians in Kaduna were protecting Muslims during prayer time. Nigerians can pull together across religious and ethnic lines. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : John Campbell is a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria. He's now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and he's joined us here in Studio 3A. Thank you so much. JOHN CAMPBELL : Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And we're joined now by Shehu Sani, a writer and activist in Nigeria. He's also the president of Civil Rights Congress, a coalition of 34 human rights groups based in Kaduna, Nigeria, and he joins us from the studios of the BBC in London. Welcome. SHEHU SANI : Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Two months ago, you tried to broker a cease-fire between Boko Haram and the government. It did not happen. Tell us what happened instead. SHEHU SANI : Why I tried to broker a cease-fire simply has to do with the very fact that since 2009, when the police crackdown on the Boko Haram as a group, it has been a cycle of violence and killings and murders and arson, and it has become very clear that the government of Nigeria is incapable of crushing the Boko Haram armed insurgency. Rather, it has led to the loss of innocent lives of Nigerians, particularly in the northeastern part of Nigeria. As a human rights activist, I thought a good or right (unintelligible) an idea of serving as a bridge. SHEHU SANI : And I reached out to the group, and I presented myself as an activist and someone who spoke against the massacre against the group in 2009, when the late President Umaru Yar'Adua ordered that group, the group shall be crushed. And then I asked them if they will attune to the idea of meeting the former President Olusegun Obasanjo. And my choice of Obasanjo was simply because he is the chairman of the board of trustees of the ruling party in Nigeria, and he's someone whom I knew when I was a political prisoner, and he was also together with me in the cell. SHEHU SANI : And then I reached out to him and gave him this idea, and he also agreed. And then that was set. The group gave out their conditions that they can sit down and talk with Obasanjo without the presence of security men, and then, there shall be free conversation, and the meeting should take place in their den, in Maiduguri. And then, I - Obasanjo agreed, and then a date was set. We went there and sat down. Now there was someone called Babakura Fugu who happened to be the guardian of most of the families of Boko Haram members who have either been killed or they are now on their own. So he offered to serve as an intercessor. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : You know what, I think we may have to jump ahead here, because we only have a few minutes left. I understand that actually one of the hosts for Boko Haram was killed, and those talks never happened. Is that right? But I'm curious, whether - are you still trying - and actually, before your answer, let me just say that you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. SHEHU SANI : Yes. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Shehu Sani, you're still trying to get these talks together? SHEHU SANI : Yes. The - Fugu, the one I was telling you, he was the one that was killed. And when he had the meeting with the Boko Haram, they gave us some possible way out of this violence, one of which is that there must be the release of all their - of their members who are currently spread in prisons and police cells across the country. And there's a need for the government to rebuild their houses, their mosques, their schools that was demolished in 2009. And then there must be a comprehensive program of rehabilitating the families of their members that were killed, over 1,000 of them in 2009. SHEHU SANI : And the suggestions was - the advice was given to President Obasanjo, and then he gave it to President Goodluck. And since then, nothing has been heard about, because the government believe that it can crush the group with the use of force, and then we just step aside and watch the government use the force. And it has not been able to work. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. Chances are you've come across the website Wikipedia in your daily online searches. It's a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and it certainly has a wealth of information on everything from the Australian cattle dog to Lady Gaga. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now imagine a Wikipedia for science, a place where scientists and others can go to research topics outside their area of expertise, find links to cutting edge studies, edit, update content. Surprisingly, it's not a new idea, but efforts to create a Wikipedia devoted to science has failed in the past. IRA FLATOW, HOST : In fact, scientists as a group, they don't seem to have embraced online tools to collaborate and do science out in the open. Why, you ask? Well, that is the subject of my next guest's book, Dr. Michael Nielsen. He is a physicist and author of the book \"Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science.\" And he joins us from Toronto, Canada. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MICHAEL NIELSEN : Thank you very much, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Why are scientists the last ones to get in on this? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Well, it's kind of funny. I mean, they certainly helped bring us the Web back in the early '90s. Unfortunately, they're pretty bought into doing things in the standard way, the way they've done them for centuries, which is you do your work in the lab, you get all your results, you write them up in a paper and possibly several years later, it all appears for your colleagues to digest at that point. MICHAEL NIELSEN : And, you know, that's a great system if you're back in the 1600 or 1700s, but today we've got better tools, but people still haven't adopted them. IRA FLATOW, HOST : These are collaborative tools, right? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Yeah, I mean, you can talk about sort of people collaborating together, sharing knowledge, maybe attacking problems out in the open, where you can bring in lots of different expertise from all over the world to maybe get a better handle on some of these problems. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Give us a flavor of how that might work. You have a couple examples. You have many examples in your book, but... MICHAEL NIELSEN : Sure, so an example I really like a lot that kind of illustrates how different this is is over the past couple of years, a group of mathematicians, starting with a Cambridge mathematician, a fellow named Tim Gowers have started what they call the Polymath Project. And what they've been doing is using blogs and a wiki to attack difficult open research problems completely in the open, allowing anybody to contribute basically by posting their ideas in the comments section of these blogs and the wiki. MICHAEL NIELSEN : And they've actually been really tremendously successful at attacking some of these problems. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So they're sort of crowdsourcing the idea and waiting for people to help them find a solution? MICHAEL NIELSEN : That's pretty much exactly what it is, yeah. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And how far can you apply this to other, let's say, disciplines outside of mathematics? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Well, you know, to some extent it's an open question because not everybody's doing it, and so it's going to be really interesting to see. There have been, you know, all kinds of efforts in different fields - astronomy, genetics and many others - which have been at least sometimes very successful. But it's still very early days, and I think it remains to be seen just how far we'll get. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, we have a lot of people interested in science who listen to us. Maybe they'll call in or send us some ideas. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us @scifri. We're talking with Michael Nielsen, author of \"Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science.\" IRA FLATOW, HOST : Maybe you would like to use networked science, you have an idea, maybe you have used it and make some suggestions, how it might work for you. Is there a wiki, I mean, is the wiki for science the central place for people to go, or can they go to other kinds of groups that they might find more attractive? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Well, it's funny actually. That's kind of a - in some ways, it's a bit of a sad story. A lot of scientists have tried starting wikis for science. One I happen to be very familiar with is a quantum computing wiki, that's my area of research. MICHAEL NIELSEN : And while a lot of people, researchers in the field were very excited by the idea of having the quantum computing wiki - certainly many I spoke to - that didn't necessarily mean they wanted to take the time themselves to go and contribute. \n\n ###",

So... IRA FLATOW, HOST : You called it a quiki(ph), right? That's a different... MICHAEL NIELSEN : Yeah, that was actually - their name was quiki, for a quantum wiki. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's good. So - but it didn't get traction, is what you're saying. MICHAEL NIELSEN : No, it didn't get traction, and to be honest, you know, I thought it was actually really well-executed. So it's not like it failed because it wasn't well-done. I think it failed because people lacked the motivation to contribute. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, one of the major obstacles to open science, you say, is scientists being rewarded for publishing scientific papers. How do you change that culture? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Yeah, so, I mean, I should say first of all that it's a terrific thing that they get rewarded. If you go back to the 17th century, scientists generally weren't rewarded much at all for sharing discoveries, and as a result, they conducted a lot of their research very, very secretively indeed. MICHAEL NIELSEN : So, you know, it's a good thing that we have this modern system, but we would like to change - I would certainly like to see a change to a new system where scientists are rewarded for sharing their ideas more broadly, for sharing data more broadly and for sharing their computer code more broadly. MICHAEL NIELSEN : Now, and getting how to do that, there's a lot of details. It's a complex question. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, let's go to Joe in Whitehall, Virginia. Hi, Joe. JOE : Hi, how are you doing? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Fine, how are you? JOE : Doing great. Listen, tell me, you're making it sound like a new concept, but isn't this the whole reason the Internet came to be, that it evolved from Arpanet back in the late '60s and early '70s? You're making it sound like a new thing. MICHAEL NIELSEN : Sure, you're absolutely right, that if you go back to 1970 or so, at that stage, it was really almost a scientific research project, and it gradually grew through the '70s and '80s, mostly in academic institutions. MICHAEL NIELSEN : But I think what we've seen through the 1990s and the 2000s is that in fact the rest of our culture has caught up to the scientists and actually gone really a long way past them, things like the success of Wikipedia or the success of open-source software like Linux really have eclipsed in how they're using these tools the way scientists are using them. And so there's some catch-up for the scientific community to do at this point. JOE : Ah, so there is. Well, well put. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, thanks for calling, Joe. JOE : Yes, sir. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if we can get another phone call from Mitch in Park Rapids, Minnesota. Hi, Mitch. MITCH : Hi, how's everybody doing? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi there. MITCH : This fits well, because my point was about - my understanding of scientific discovery, of research and development, is that it's funded by private businesses mostly, and so it's for-profit. And so if I am a business owner and I am going to be put $10 million into a new way to put stem cells in somebody's eye or, you know, whatever, I'm not going to want to share that with somebody because I'm doing that for my own profit. MITCH : And so, you need to have that network of millions of people, as Linux does, who are willing to put in their own time for the common good, and the culture of computer and technology is not the same as the culture of scientists. And so it's going to take time until that culture of research shifts to the openness of the technology industry. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, people willing to work for nothing. MICHAEL NIELSEN : So let me come back on - you said that - you started by saying that most research is funded by companies. But actually, about $100 billion a year is spent of just public money on basic research. That's a lot of money, obviously. I mean, it's an absolutely astounding number of dollars to be spending on basic research. MICHAEL NIELSEN : And that money, presumably, is being spent in the public interest, and so I think you can make a pretty good case that publicly funded science should be open science. MICHAEL NIELSEN : Now, you can shift from that kind of basic public research to focus on more applied commercial research, as you suggest, as well. And so you might say, well, what happens there? And actually, what happens there is kind of interesting. To some extent I agree with you, there will continue to be a secretive culture within many companies, but there are some big companies - Eli Lilly is one, for example, who are interested in what they call open innovation models, wherein they actually give up some knowledge about their internal processes and their internal problems, and they try and recruit people from outside the company to help attack those problems. MICHAEL NIELSEN : So even some what you might think traditionally very secretive organizations are actually finding some benefits. IRA FLATOW, HOST : When you have an open society, you allow anybody to come in and take a look and I guess in a way become a peer reviewer, right? I mean, won't peer review change if billions of people are all out to look at the work and comment on it? MICHAEL NIELSEN : It's a really interesting thought. You know, again, I think it's early days, but there are some interesting examples. I guess last year, there was a lot of talk about this so-called arsenic life publications. So some people found that maybe arsenic was being, you know, actually put into the DNA in living organisms, and there was a paper published in Science that got a huge amount of publicity. And actually, some online bloggers started to look in detail at this, particularly a person named Rosie Redfield, and they started to pull apart the paper with a lot of help from the community and comments from many, many different people. And I think it's fair to say that maybe that work has resulted in a lot of skepticism now about arsenic life. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255. Some examples that I can think of where, I think, gets across the idea of scientists, of citizen scientists. We've had examples - we've had people on the program who talked about, you know, crowdsourcing gene folding, right? People can see patterns better than computers. They can figure out maybe how gene molecules, I'm sorry, not genes, protein molecules fold a little bit better. There's something you talk about in your book called the Galaxy Zoo. I remember we talked about that also. MICHAEL NIELSEN : Ah, right. So this is the - where they crowdsourcing galaxy classifications... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yes. MICHAEL NIELSEN : ...that project you're talking about. Yeah. So what do you want to know, Ira? IRA FLATOW, HOST : No, I'm just saying that is this the kind of public science that you're talking about, getting people involved who may not be scientists, maybe citizen scientists, to help out scientists in their own project? MICHAEL NIELSEN : Oh, absolutely. I mean, their - in Galaxy Zoo's case, they recruited a quarter of a million people who actually did, get this, 150 million galaxy classifications, which enables the astronomers who started the project to solve all kinds of interesting astronomical problems that they just couldn't do otherwise. You can't, as a scientist, sit down and do 150 million classifications at your desk. They'll just take too long. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Is it - do you find that there is resistance to the way - to changing the way, the old way, of things being done? Are older scientists resistant to change and becoming part of this process? MICHAEL NIELSEN : I'm not so sure I'd say resistance so much as it's just difficult to see how to cause a large-scale change. How do you get everybody simultaneously to adopt the new way of doing things? And so some people will kind of throw up their hands and say, well, it just can't be done. Probably the people actually get that the most from, scientists who are sort of in their mid-career. They're doing post docs or they're at the end of their graduate studies. And while they're subject to the system, they don't really feel like there's very much they can do to change it. When I talk to younger scientists, they're often very enthusiastic. And sometimes, when I talk to much more senior scientists, because they feel like they have some power to actually change the system, they can actually be quite enthusiastic. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Talking with Michael Nielsen, author of \"Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Network Science\" on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. Let's go to the phone lines. To David in Rochester, New York. Hi, David. DAVID : Hi. I think I am a good example of this with amateur archaeologists in North America. And years ago, I was interested in the archaeology of western New York here and started noticing these stone structures in the woods. And there were some local information that it was Native American. And with the birth of the Internet, all these people started to blog about how they were finding these things in the woods and how there's a connection with all these amateur archaeologists and the professional archaeologists are beginning to look into this. It's interesting how we all share this information and it's grown. \n\n ###",

PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : But I'm the decider. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Every Wednesday, Political Junkie Ken Rudin joins us to recap the week in politics. This week we're at member station WMFE in Orlando, less than a week before the suddenly all-important Florida primary, where there are now four GOP presidential hopefuls still standing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Rick Perry quit even before the South Carolina vote. That vaulted Newt to the top of the national polls again as the air of inevitability leaks out of the Romney balloon. In Jersey, veteran Democratic Senator Bob Menendez gets a formidable opponent, and the Supreme Court orders new congressional lines in Texas. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In a few minutes, we'll focus on the Florida primary, and later in this jumbo edition of the Political Junkie, the Florida GOP state chairman joins us. But first, Political Junkie here with us - Ken Rudin's in the studio at WMFE. We begin, as we always do, with a trivia question. Hey, Ken. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Hi, Neal. Well, OK, we know that four years ago in the Florida primary, Hillary Clinton won the primary but did not get the nomination. Before Hillary Clinton, who was the last person to win the primary in Florida but failed to win the nomination? NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you think you know the answer to this week's trivia question, the last person before Hillary Clinton to win the Florida primary but lose his or her's party nomination, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Of course the winner gets the fabulous no-prize T-shirt in exchange for a promise of a digital image of themselves for our wall of shame. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Ken, we begin when we can with actual votes. South Carolina, wow. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, you know, that seems like months ago, and it was only last Saturday, but it was a thumping, as Newt Gingrich beat Mitt Romney 40 to 28 percent, a 12-point victory, far better than any of the polls indicated. As you say, it did burst a balloon in the Mitt Romney inevitability argument and once again resuscitates Newt Gingrich, whose campaign was all but dead in June, came back to be a frontrunner for a while in December and then also deflated as he got hit by ads in Iowa. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But now he has the momentum in this race. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And he is, at least according to one Mitt Romney endorser, a viable candidate. This is Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina, the Republican who's a supporter of Mitt Romney. It didn't sound that way when he talked on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n\n ###",

He's the guy that we saw, 40 percent of us, the best to go into the arena and beat Barack Obama. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So that's one of Mitt Romney's supporters. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I actually didn't know he was a Mitt Romney supporter. I didn't know that. But anyway, but I thought still the fact is that a lot of people who - the argument for Mitt Romney all along had been he is the guy who is best able to defeat President Obama. And if you looked at the exit polls coming out of South Carolina, Gingrich won on everything, including electability, including - and also from women. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Remember the bombshell from Marianne Gingrich about the open marriage, something that Neal Conan and I have, I think we can admit that now... NEAL CONAN, HOST : We do? You never told me. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Anyway, but so - and he even did well with women. He did well with almost every demographic. Ron Paul did well with younger voters. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As he always does. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : As he always does. And Romney did best with older voters, but it seemed like Gingrich, you know, he also carried 43 of the state's 46 counties, truly a landslide. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And here's somebody who does sound like a Mitt Romney surrogate, it's the New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE : I think Newt Gingrich has embarrassed the party over time. Whether he'll do it again in the future, I don't know, but Governor Romney never has. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And of course that is more of an attack on - and Romney has now been forced to go on the attack here in Florida. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, perhaps one of the reasons that Mitt Romney didn't do as well in South Carolina was the fact that some people said that he was not as aggressive. He didn't have the fire in the belly, at least in the debates, and Gingrich, if nothing else, is a very effective debater. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But at the same time, he does have the flaws. He was reprimanded by Congress. He did resign as speaker after 1998, and Mitt Romney was not shy about bringing that up during the debate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nor, of course, the payments he received from Freddie Mac. MITT ROMNEY : If your entities are getting paid by health companies that could benefit from a piece of legislation, and you then meet with Republican congressman and encourage them to support that legislation, you can call it whatever you'd like; I call it influence-peddling. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Influence-peddling is the allegation. If it smells like a lobbyist, if it walks like a lobbyist, if it talks like a lobbyist, it's a lobbyist. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And not a historian, and you know, for all the focus on Mitt Romney's tax returns, and of course Mitt Romney was very clever to release them on the Monday during the State of the Union address and before a debate, you know... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Between the two debates. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Between the two debates. So he tried to get that issue gone from the campaign dialogue. He didn't completely do it, but now the onus seems to be on Newt Gingrich and his Freddie Mac contract. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, Newt Gingrich is running a more presidential - i.e., against Barack Obama, campaign as Mitt Romney used to try to do, and here's been one of his major themes here in the state of Florida, where he's talking about regime change 90 miles south of Miami. \n\n ###",

In the meantime, we have some people on the line who think they have the answer to this week's trivia question, and that is: Before Hillary Clinton, the last person to win the Florida primary but lose the nomination of their party. 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Laura(ph), and Laura's with us from Green Bay in Wisconsin. LAURA : Hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. LAURA : My guess is Howard Dean. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That's a scream. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : The Dean people are going to be so upset with you, Neal, as I am, even though we have an open marriage. No, Howard Dean did not win the 2004 primary in Florida. It was won by John Kerry, who won the nomination. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call. Let's see if we go next to - this is Troy. We're trying to get - maybe that Line 7 is not working. Instead we'll go to Line 1, and Sherry's(ph) on the line, Sherry with us from Southport in North Carolina. SHERRY : Rudy Giuliani. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, that's an interesting point because Rudy Giuliani... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Really hoped he would. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Matter of fact, he based his whole 2008 campaign on the Florida primary and bypassed Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, but by doing that, he was ignored by the voters here, and he went on to finishing a poor third in the primary, which was won by John McCain. SHERRY : OK. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Sherry, and let's go next to - this is Matt, and Matt with us from Portsmouth, Arkansas. MATT : Yes, is it Bob Dole? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, Bob Dole did win the primary in 1996, and of course he was the nominee. He didn't win the primary in 1988, but he wasn't the nominee in 1988. So in other words... NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you mix and match, you get it right. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nice try, thanks very much. MATT : Thanks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's go to - this is Gabriel(ph), Gabriel with us from Boston. GABRIEL : Hi there, how are you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good, thanks. GABRIEL : I believe the answer is Gary Hart. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Gary Hart is the correct answer. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ding, ding, ding. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : In 1984, remember he came - he was second place in Iowa, which propelled him to a victory in New Hampshire, and while he was losing elsewhere in the South to Walter Mondale, he really beat Mondale pretty handily in Florida. But ironically, because he was not prepared, he did not win most of the delegates, but he did win the primary. Gary Hart in 1984 is the correct answer. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Stay on the line, Gabriel, and we'll collect your particulars and send you off a fabulous Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt in exchange for your promise of a digital picture of yourself to post it on our wall of shame. GABRIEL : With pleasure, and of course no monkey business. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Glad you said that and not me. Hold on. Thanks and congratulations. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Actually, this is perfect weather to be wearing a Political Junkie T-shirt. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It is perfect weather for a Political Junkie T-shirt. In the meantime, the president was dressed rather more elegantly last night at the State of the Union message, where typically - well, if Osawatomie, Kansas was the start of his campaign, he followed up last night in the State of the Union message, where of course he's staring right at the Republicans he's pretty much running against. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And that is the theme that he hit in Kansas. He hit it again last night. We can expect to hear that for the next several months. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And of course it came at a time when Mitt Romney is telling the world that he is paying 14 percent of his income in taxes and while most of the country is paying much more. President Obama said that the minimum tax rate should be 30 percent. It's about income distribution and inequality, and having Romney's taxes come out the same week as the State of the Union was a good - a bonus for the president. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana, not a presidential candidate this year, as many hoped he would be, came out, and he did the Republican rebuttal. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE : Here were are four years later. They can't find a job. Why should they support him? We're living at a time with 13 million people out of work, four million people out of work for more than a year. Forty-nine million Americans living below the poverty line. Undue  influence by Obama campaign supporters. Things are not going in the right direction, they're going in the wrong direction. \n\n ###",

That's actually not true. That's a Republican National Committee ad. We played the wrong cut of tape there, and I apologize for that. That was my mistake. But that is an ad the Republican National Committee has started to run against Barack Obama in places like Virginia and North Carolina, important states for Barack Obama. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Look, we heard the president last night. I mean, obviously what it is is basically sort of like - not so much laying out his campaign for re-election, but it's pointing out that the Republicans - here's how he differs from the Republican Party. While they are beating each other up, here's what he's doing for the middle class. Here's what he's doing for the unemployed. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And, you know, while (technical difficulties) numbers are falling down, Mitt Romney's approval numbers are decreasing rapidly as he's getting into that gutter, you know, battle with Newt Gingrich, the president's numbers are inching up. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the president is beginning to run his first real political ad, and let's take a listen to that. UNDENTIFIED MAN : For the first time in 13 years, our dependence on foreign oil is below 50 percent. President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen America's energy economy. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I'm Barack Obama, and I approved this message. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it certainly didn't hurt the president of the United States to, the day after his State of the Union speech, be able to announce that an American hostage and a Danish hostage had been rescued by U.S. Special Forces in Somalia. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Which comes on the heels of the Osama bin Laden and the Gaddafi death in Libya, which the president mentioned in the State of the Union. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It's Political Junkie day in Orlando, Florida this week, ahead of next week's primary. Up next, we want to hear from Florida primary voters. Have you made up your mind yet? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. Stay with us, TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan at the studios of member station WMFE in Orlando, less than a week before what's become the all-important Florida primary. Ken Rudin, our Political Junkie, is here with us. And Ken, do we have a ScuttleButton winner this week? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : We did, actually. We failed to mention it last week, so we're going back two weeks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Two weeks... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Matter of fact, this is how old the puzzle is. The solution was New Hampshire primary, and that was like several years ago. But the winner was Annette Hernandez(ph) of San Francisco. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And she will, of course, get a Political Junkie T-shirt for her winning entry, and so that's just two weeks ago, there wasn't one last week? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : There was, but we don't announce two winners in a row. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, well, I didn't know that. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And besides, San Francisco hasn't been winning much lately, so it would be nice if somebody... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ooh, ooh, twisting the knife. In the meantime, a correction. I misidentified Lindsey Graham as a Romney supporter, and that - as an endorser. He may be a supporter, but that remains to be seen. I apologize for the mistake. You can find Ken's latest ScuttleButton puzzle and Ken's Political Junkie column at npr.org/junkie. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We are not the only ones touring the Sunshine State this week. Three of the four GOP candidates are here trying to drum up support before Tuesday's vote. Florida, unlike any other primary or caucus state thus far, the GOP primary is only open to registered Republicans. The state's population is significantly larger than New Hampshire, South Carolina or Iowa, and it's got several expensive media markets. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Advertising will likely play a major role here over the next six days. We want to hear from Florida primary voters. Have you made up your mind yet? Give us a call, 800-989-8255.

Nice to meet you in person. LUCY MORGAN : Good to meet you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And thanks for taking the drive all the way from Tallahassee for us. And Florida moved up its primary before the last presidential election to gain national prominence. Well, that certainly seems to have worked out. LUCY MORGAN : I guess so. They - for the moment, they've lost half their delegates, but they have hopes of getting them back from the nominee. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah, they did last time around when they did this, as the Republican Party decided oh well, let bygones be bygones. LUCY MORGAN : Well, you know, they do want votes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's interesting, we're saying - have Florida voters made up their minds? A lot of Florida voters have already made up their minds. If fact, they already voted. LUCY MORGAN : A couple hundred thousand have already voted, and there are like 300,000 absentee requests or so. So we're well on the way to the election. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And also with us here in the studio is Aubrey Jewett. He's a political scientist at the University of Central Florida, just down the road from us here, and nice of you to come in as well. AUBREY JEWETT : Great to be here today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we often hear Florida is such a diverse and huge place. I've heard it described, I think by you, as not a state so much as a country. AUBREY JEWETT : Well, yeah, it has 10 media markets. You referenced that earlier, how many different media markets there are. And we are just very diverse. The diversity in Florida is really mirroring what you're seeing across the country. We have a large Hispanic population, large black population, a very large elderly population, and of course lots of baby boomers, families with kids. So it's quite diverse. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The ethnic mix also very different from, well, South Carolina for sure. AUBREY JEWETT : Absolutely. You know, another reason why Florida is taking its proper place as early in the primary is we do represent the diversity of the country a lot better, I think, than any of the previous states. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Lucy Morgan, all those media markets, if you're going to run in Florida, you need an organization, you need money, you need to have things established. LUCY MORGAN : Lots of money. You really need lots of money, and he who has bought the airwaves may dominate, which I suspect may be Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, Lucy, I have a question about that because we're talking about money, and Romney does have that, and we're talking about organization in a state that needs organization, and Romney has that too. But Newt Gingrich has momentum, and we saw that coming out of South Carolina. You know, Romney won New Hampshire handily. Newt Gingrich won South Carolina handily. What do you make of the money versus the organize - I'm sorry, the money-versus-the-momentum argument? LUCY MORGAN : I think that the establishment Republicans, and the money is behind Romney at the moment. Those make up the early voters a lot. I think this is going to be a close race in Florida, that Romney - it was Romney's to lose, and the weapon that Mitt(ph)  was handed in South Carolina by John King and ABC helped him surge ahead. LUCY MORGAN : However, we've seen him surge before, only to sort of fall back, and I think that may well happen to him here. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Does the Freddie Mac argument that Romney's making against Newt Gingrich resonate in Florida? LUCY MORGAN : I think it does in some areas of Florida. The whole housing industry problem is bigger here certainly than it was in South Carolina, and in New Hampshire and Iowa as well. So the housing thing does resonate here. LUCY MORGAN : The question I have is how much Romney's own finances are going to play into this. I suspect there won't be as much animosity toward his wealth here as there would have been in South Carolina, particularly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Aubrey Jewett, I have to follow that up. In South Carolina, we had the Tea Party governor endorse Mitt Romney, the establishment candidate. That didn't work out so well. Here in Florida, you have a former governor, Jeb Bush, who sits over all of this like the... AUBREY JEWETT : Godfather of Republican politics. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You said it, I didn't. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But he hasn't endorsed anybody. LUCY MORGAN : No, and he's not. AUBREY JEWETT : Yeah, I think he's staying out of it, and I think our governor, I think I read the governor has also refused to endorse anybody. You know, interestingly, four years ago Charlie Crist waited until about three days before the election and jumped in on the McCain bandwagon and then took credit when McCain won. But this time around, I don't think we're going to see any endorsements from the highest profile leaders in Republican politics. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Aubrey, we compare the electorate in Florida, the Republican electorate in Florida, with South Carolina. South Carolina is much more conservative, more Tea Party-oriented. But in the 2010 primary for governor here, Rick Scott, a Tea Party guy, beat the establishment guy, Bill McCollum. AUBREY JEWETT : He did, and Lucy and I were talking about this just a little bit earlier off the air. In Florida, Bill McCollum, who was a 20-year very conservative Republican congressman and then a very conservative attorney general, he was beaten by Rick Scott, who was able to convince Republicans in Florida that Bill McCollum was not conservative enough. LUCY MORGAN : But he had a $75 million advantage. He spent $75 million of his own money to flood the market with ads. AUBREY JEWETT : He did, and - but it does raise the question - it's the question, of course, that Republicans have been asking about Mitt Romney for the last several months, and is he conservative enough, can they embrace him and - or are they still just looking? And right now it's just so tight in Florida. AUBREY JEWETT : Up till about a week ago, I was among the many who thought, OK, in the end, Romney's going to pull it out, but I'll tell you: He is in a world of trouble right now in Florida. He may hang on, but Gingrich is really surging in the polls. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lucy Morgan, what do you think? LUCY MORGAN : I think Romney will pull it out. The newest poll, the better of the polls, Quinnipiac, came out this morning giving Romney a one-point advantage, within the margin of error. But I think the advantage he has is the early vote and the establishment Republicans who are behind him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get some callers on the line, 800-989-8255. Florida primary voters, have you made up your minds yet? We'll start with Marie(ph), and Marie's on with us from Fort Lauderdale. MARIE : Yes, good afternoon. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Afternoon, go ahead, please. MARIE : Yes, well, I have decided to shift gears. Instead of voting Democrat, I am voting for Mitt Romney because I am a very dissatisfied Democratic voter. As a Haitian-American, I have seen no change in the status of a lot of my friends as far as finances are concerned. A lot of them have lost their houses, and all the promises that were made during the campaign, none of them have been accomplished. So I am switching my gears to see if I can vote for capitalism. \n\n ###",

Why Mitt Romney, if you're going to switch to vote Republican, among the other Republicans? MARIE : Well, the other candidates, they just, they do not appeal to me. Gingrich has a lot of baggage. Mitt Romney is a capitalist. He has made a lot of money, and I - he stands for what I believe the American dream is all about - fighting... LUCY MORGAN : Did you change your registration to Republican? MARIE : Yes, I have. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much, Marie, appreciate it. MARIE : You're welcome.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Amber, you're on the air, go ahead, please. AMBER : I have decided to vote for Ron Paul. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And why? AMBER : I guess what it boils down to for me is a smaller and limited, more federal government and the restoration of state rights. And I believe that he'll represent me in that way. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Amber, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Ron Paul... LUCY MORGAN : I wonder if Ron Paul might pick up some votes out of this. We have a growing independent registration of voters in Florida, and if you assume that there will be people who resent Mitt Romney's money and the way - and the taxes he paid and others who will resent Gingrich's personal life, I wonder if Ron Paul might not be the beneficiary of some of that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken, though, we keep hearing Ron Paul, he's here for the debates, but because it's a winner-take-all primary, he's ducking out. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : That's exactly right. He's not campaigning in the state, and obviously he's looking toward the caucus states, where the delegates are chosen proportionally. LUCY MORGAN : Except in North Florida, the people standing on street corners with signs are holding Ron Paul signs. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And we haven't mentioned Rick Santorum either. Is he a factor here at all? LUCY MORGAN : Less so, I think. But certainly, he'll get some votes. There are evangelicals that will go to Santorum that will run away from the others. \n\n ###",

AUBREY JEWETT : Yeah. I think in the - within the Republican base of Florida, you'll see a lot - more moderates and just a lot more economic voters and less of the Christian conservatives, social conservatives. There's certainly numerically a lot of them, but as a percentage of the Republican Party in Florida not nearly as much as South Carolina, nor in the Iowa caucus for sure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see - we go next to Oviedo. Oviedo with us - excuse me. David is with us from Oviedo, in Florida. DAVID : Good afternoon. Yeah... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, please. DAVID : ...I am an independent who often leans toward the Republican Party, but I'm looking at the selection of candidates this time, and I'm trying to maintain a little bit of distance and not get drawn in by all the pre-election hoopla. And I have to ask myself, are these the best that our political system can come up with? We've got a - one candidate, a leading candidate in the Republican Party who's been publically discredited by - in his last office. Another one who claims to be an outsider business person, but yet, you know, he's clearly an insider and part of a privileged class. The only - to me - the only one with any creditability in the Republican Party is Ron Paul, who's got some consistency in what he's saying. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And do you plan to make your vote for Ron Paul then? DAVID : Well, yeah, I guess that's who I am leading - leaning towards, but, you know, at this point, again, I find myself at 54 years old - once again, I'm not voting for somebody. I'm voting against the other candidates. And it just seems like in the last three, two to three presidential elections, the candidate that have been put forward, I just cannot believe that they're the best minds, the best thinkers, the most effective politician that this system can put forward. (Unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : I wonder, Lucy Morgan, we, you know, that's an interesting point of view, and I think that there are a fair number of Republicans who feel that way. LUCY MORGAN : Oh, I talk to them every day. There are a lot of Republicans who really regret the final lineup they have to choose from; many of whom would like to say Jeb Bush or somebody like him jump into this race. I am convinced that Jeb has no intent of jumping in this race, that if he ever runs for president, it would be at least four years from now. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Aubrey Jewett, would you agree? AUBREY JEWETT : Absolutely. And I was thinking back. I think Tim Pawlenty actually made a big mistake when he dropped out after that Iowa straw poll. We saw every other viable Republican race to the top as, again, as Republicans were searching for the not-Romney candidate. And I'm sure if he had stayed in long enough, he would have found himself on top eventually. And I think he would have been a very credible candidate, as a former governor and sort of solid on policy and probably good with Tea Party and conservatives, et cetera. But fact is, you know, he - I think he just got a little scared that Michele Bachmann was doing too well, and he dropped out. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking on The Political Junkie this week with Lucy Morgan, who's a senior correspondent for the Tampa Bay Times, and Aubrey Jewett, political scientist at the University of Central Florida. Of course, Ken Rudin is with us. We're in Orlando, Florida today, less than a week ahead of the primary. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And one P.S. to the - to David's point, the caller: dissatisfaction with candidates is not new. In 1960, Democrats were saying, is Jack Kennedy the best we could do? He's a, you know, a young guy. He's inexperienced. He's too green. I mean, can't we do better than John F. Kennedy? So that dissatisfaction, we've been around for a long time. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get another caller on the line. Let's go to Mike, and Mike is on the line with us from Tampa. MIKE : Hello, folks. How are you doing? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good. Thanks. MIKE : You kind of covered some of my stuff, but I'm just concerned about who to vote for. I'm an evangelical Christian and, you know, a little concerned about Romney's waffling on abortion. And I don't really want to say much about Gingrich. I'm not sure about what to do with Santorum. I really don't know. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So you're in a bit of a quandary. Santorum, we're told, at least by the evangelical powers that be that met in Texas the other weekend, that your votes should go to him. MIKE : Well, I've heard that, and I don't know - I - it's the lobbying stuff that he was involved in and some of that, that kind of makes me a little nervous. So I'm just not excited, and that doesn't feel good. I want to be able to be excited about somebody to vote for and get behind him. And I just don't feel that way. \n\n ###",

Lucy Morgan, have you seen excitement on the Republican side this year? LUCY MORGAN : Yeah, a lot of people are excited but not for the reasons you would expect in an election. I wonder if Aubrey might know the breakdown between men and women registered as Republicans in Florida because I do think that the women's vote is unlikely to go to Gingrich in a mass number. If the people I have heard from are any example because a lot of the women who know what Gingrich's background is are furious with him. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But women voted for Gingrich in South Carolina. LUCY MORGAN : I understand that. And Nikki Haley didn't. But... AUBREY JEWETT : And then, that Quinnipiac poll that you mentioned earlier, Lucy, I looked at some of the breakdowns, and there is the gender gap that you mentioned in Florida right now in the polls, that men were more supportive of Gingrich - Republican men, I should say. And Republican women were more supportive of Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : What characteristic - as we look at the jigsaw puzzle that is the state of Florida and all the different places it is, from the panhandle all the way down to South Beach and Key West, very different places - what issue, if there is an issue, is going to distinguish these candidates, Aubrey, do you think? AUBREY JEWETT : Well... LUCY MORGAN : The... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, Lucy. LUCY MORGAN : ...economy perhaps. We are a state that's had very high unemployment, and a lot of people losing their houses. I think - I have to believe that plays into Romney's hand, a successful businessman. If you look at who - if you're thinking of how the average voter would look, but I don't know that it does. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Aubrey? AUBREY JEWETT : Yeah. And I was going to agree that the economy and jobs and the housing issues, theoretically, those are - well, not theoretically. Those are the most important issues to Florida voters, including most Republican voters. But as far as what distinguishes the candidates in the minds of the voters right now, I'm really not sure it's going to come down to issue base, I think, and this is bad news for Romney. I think it's going to be a more visceral, you know, Republicans are looking for someone that's more of the attack-style politics and somebody that they, at least in their view, is a more trusted conservative. AUBREY JEWETT : For Gingrich, that's good news. He built a long reputation as a conservative, you know, helping the Republicans take control of Congress in '94. Of course, since he got out of office, he's actually in a number of occasions not been so conservative. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida, thanks very much for your time today. Lucy Morgan, thank you, too. LUCY MORGAN : Thank you. Thanks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lucy Morgan, a senior correspondent for the Tampa Bay Times. Political junkie Ken Rudin is going to stay with us. In a moment, we'll stay and talk with the state chairman of the Republican Florida Party. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Political junkie Ken Rudin is with us here in the studio at WMFE in Orlando, less than a week ahead of the critical primary here in the state of Florida. And joining us now is - it's going to be a winner-take-all front primary with 50 delegates at stake, more than any other primary to this point. It's a state Barack Obama carried in 2008, one the Democrats hope to hold onto. But, well, let's get through the primary first. If you plan - voters, if you plan to vote in the Republican primary, have you made up your mind? 800-989-8255. Email, talk@npr.org. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joining us now on the phone from Jacksonville is Leonard Curry, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. And, Chairman Curry, nice to have you today on TALK OF THE NATION. LEONARD CURRY : It's good to be with you. Thanks for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And a lot of people thought after three contests, this presidential - this primary season would effectively be over by now. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### LEONARD CURRY : That - a couple of weeks ago, that was definitely what the pundits were saying. We've been saying for a year, though, that it would be all eyes on Florida and all about Florida when we set our primary date, and here we are, and it is certainly all about Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You took a risk changing your primary date. You are technically in violation of party rules. And could lose what, half your delegates? LEONARD CURRY : Yeah. Right now, we are - we would have had 99 delegates, and we have 50 which will be winner-take-all. But let me just clarify. The primary date is governed on - is under Florida statute, that the statutory authority runs with the - sits with the Florida legislature, not with the party. So they set the date at January 31st. As a sovereign state, they did what they thought, and we're acting in the best interest of over four million registered Republicans in the state of Florida. LEONARD CURRY : I'm not happy that we lost our delegates, but I do think that - I've always said I think it's important that we go early, and I understand why the legislature did what it did. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, Mr. Chairman, that's a good question because what happened four years ago, the same thing, the Democrats lost all their delegates. And as a matter of fact, the DNC, Howard Dean - Chairman Howard Dean told the candidates not to even campaign in Florida. And Hillary Clinton basically won a meaningless victory. And the Republicans lost half their delegation. And yet - I mean, couldn't Florida still be early but just not in January? Couldn't it be the first week of February? LEONARD CURRY : Well - and again, the committee that met that made this decision, based on what they were hearing around the country, and there was a lot of talk about a lot of other states moving their dates up, they believed that if they didn't put a stake in the ground early and lock up January 31st, that there was a good chance that we would not be right behind South Carolina. So based on an analysis, they made a decision. Agree or disagree with it, it's where we are now. And it's turned out to be - work out for us. All eyes on Florida, winner take all, 50 delegates, it's a big deal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I have to tell you after we've been to campaign stops in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's kind of nice to be in Florida. LEONARD CURRY : We've had an unusually warm winter this year, so I'm not complaining. It's been very pleasant. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Actually, it was warm in Iowa, too, but comparatively warm. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But it was very hot during the debates. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It was very hot during the debates. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I have to ask you, you have not endorsed anybody. So I wonder, how do you handicap the race right now? LEONARD CURRY : I think it's wide open. The - with Newt winning South Carolina, each candidate having won three states. It's wide open. And it's - I expect it to be pretty volatile up through - right up to the primary date. Our last debate is in Jacksonville, Florida, on Thursday night this week. And if you look at how important these debates have been, how big of a role they played in voters making decisions, I'm arguing that this is - we've been in the playoffs all along, and this is the Super Bowl of debates. And this is where - this is the big game for each of these candidates to win Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And given your knowledge of the state, if somebody tries to drop the gloves and mix it up - there'd been some pretty stinging attacks starting in South Carolina and moving on down here to Florida - does that work with Florida voters? LEONARD CURRY : You know, if all - if everybody stays negative, it will work. I believe that if a candidate is - can come out in a debate with a clear, compelling message and argument - moral argument for the free market and job creation and how that will affect people's lives and contrast that with how big government programs have failed and really have not lifted anyone out of poverty, if someone can come with that message, I believe that the voters will respond to that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Mr. Chairman, also let me ask you a question that I asked the two previous guests. We always talked about Florida being a very important state with organization and money. It's a big state with expensive markets and ostensibly that should help Mitt Romney, but then you do have the momentum of Newt Gingrich coming from South Carolina. What prevails in a state like this? LEONARD CURRY : Yeah. Money being able to play in the 10 media markets and having significant money and resources and organization is very important. But the debates have changed the game this year. It seems, four years ago \u2013 it was so long ago - but it seems to me the debates have played a much bigger role, that the (unintelligible) media that's coming out of this debate - these debates gives someone a chance in Florida that maybe doesn't have the historical fund that you'd have to have to be competitive here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get another caller in on the conversation. Let's go to Tom, and Tom is on the line from Pensacola. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, Tom. TOM : I'd like to voice my support for Newt Gingrich and... NEAL CONAN, HOST : And why are you voting for the former speaker? TOM : I'm voting for the former speaker because in the '90s he got so much of the conservative agenda passed with the Contract of America. And... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Contract of - with America, Ken, we remember that as a remarkably effective campaign tool. Did it turn into actual legislation once the Republicans took office in 1994? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, some, yes, like welfare reform, working with President Clinton, but like terms limits, things like that, it did not. The thing about Newt Gingrich, he was always seen as more of a visionary that somebody in power able to implement his proposals. TOM : Tom? TOM : Yes, I'm still here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK. So - but you believe he's the candidate who can make a real change in Washington? TOM : Yes. And can I do a little bit of handicapping? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure. TOM : Well, up here in the panhandle, I believe that Newt Gingrich has a lot of support, and I believe that he has the best chance of carrying at least the northwestern counties of the state. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Leonard Curry, what do you think of Tom's handicapping? LEONARD CURRY : I think it's wide open. Again, I really think that the voters - the polls are showing pretty much a dead heat right now between Romney and Gingrich. And I think that whichever of these two guys comes with a positive, compelling argument that how job creation and the free market will affect individual lives and allow us to fund education and reform other programs, that's going to be the candidate that will emerge victorious. If they stay negative, if it's all negativity, it's really a toss-up. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Tom, thanks very much for the call. TOM : All right. You're welcome. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email: Since so many snowbirds have second homes in Florida, is there evidence that some might vote twice in their home states too? Is there any mechanism to ensure that doesn't happen, Chairman Curry? LEONARD CURRY : I'm sure - yes. Our supervisor of elections in various counties, they have safeguards in place, and I'm sure that they're doing everything they can to ensure that we don't have either blatant voter fraud or someone who just makes an honest mistake.

Hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, John. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. JOHN : Yeah. I'm casting my vote as a Republican. I've always voted as a Republican. I'm going to stick with Rick Santorum because I believe he is the one who's got the cleanest slate. He doesn't have all the baggage that Romney has with his IRS issues and that Gingrich has with his wife issues. So I think it's safe to say Santorum would have the least ammunition to go against with Obama. Obama would probably have not much to fire at him. So I'm going to go safe and go Santorum. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, John. Thanks very much for the call. Ken, that's interesting. We forgot to mention that I think the same day that the - just before the election here - in South Carolina, rather - it was just about the same day, it turned out, Rick Santorum won Iowa. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah. He won by a whopping 34 votes as opposed  to Mitt Romney winning it by six votes. But nobody seems to get advantage out of Iowa, and it doesn't seemed like Rick Santorum has either, even with, as you said, these - the group of evangelical leaders who, in Texas, said that Santorum is the right kind of candidate. But now it seems like - well, look. With Ron Paul disappeared from the state, Santorum seemed to be a bystander in the battle between Romney and Gingrich. It does seem like to be a two-person race right now. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Leonard Curry, you said pretty a dead heat between Gingrich and Romney. Is this down to a two-man race? LEONARD CURRY : I mean right now, that's what the polls would indicate, but we've seen that we've been surprised so many times this election cycle, this primary season so far that - I mean, who knows. You know, there could be a surprise here between here and next week and could knock somebody off and someone else could emerge. But right now, based on polling, it's Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Mr. Curry, obviously President Obama won this state narrowly four years ago. Is the battle among the Republicans hurting their chances of taking the state back in November? LEONARD CURRY : I don't think so. Whatever our candidates - while I don't like the fact that we're in a circle of firing squad right now, we're beating each other up - President Obama is going to say the same thing, so what's out there now will just, he'll regurgitate and would come up anyway. So I don't think it's going to hurt us in the long run. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Henry. LEONARD CURRY : I don't particularly care for it I want to see a vision, and I want to hear a vision, and I want to know the vision and the view for Florida and America, but I don't think it hurts us in the general. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Henry is on the line with us from Miami. HENRY : Hi. I love the program. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thank you. HENRY : Yeah. I'm just calling to comment. I'm in Miami. And amongst my peers and the people I speak with, one of the big issues is everyone's opinion of electability, who can be the strongest opponent in November. And that comes up as more of a topic than any specific issue or stance in that regard. And I just want to get your guys' opinion on that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Do you see any great distinction, Chairman Curry, on the issues between, say, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum? And obviously you would have to say yes there is with Ron Paul, but those other three? LEONARD CURRY : No. I'd say that generally all of the candidates believe in the big picture that the party believes in, and which is more freedom and economic freedom and job creation, and that's how you affect people's lives, and that's how you fund a safety net to take care of people that are in trouble. But I just - I'd like to see somebody emerge with a compelling argument on that. So no, I don't see huge differences. LEONARD CURRY : And even though Ron Paul has some ideas that are different than the other candidates, look, he's brought to the conversation some important things that I think are a healthy discussion. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Henry, thanks very much. You've not made up your mind, Henry? \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. Stem cell therapy, it seems, is always promising, promising to cure diseases or illnesses. And this week, a study using embryonic stem cells has increased the hope of fulfilling some of those promises. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Researchers say results of an early clinical trial indicate it may be possible to restore vision using embryonic stem cells as treatment. It was published in The Lancet. Human embryonic stem cells were used to treat macular degeneration in two legally blind patients. Four months after the transplants, researchers say the therapy appears to be safe and has even improved the patients' vision. IRA FLATOW, HOST : The study was the first published report of the use of embryonic stem cells in humans. That comes over a decade after these cells were first isolated in the lab. Dr. Robert Lanza is the chief scientific officer of the biotech firm Advanced Cell Technology, which funded the research. Dr. Lanza was also co-author of The Lancet study. He joins us from Marlborough, Massachusetts. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ROBERT LANZA : Thank you, a great pleasure. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What was the purpose of this trial using embryonic stem cells? ROBERT LANZA : Well, we were studying the safety and tolerability of the cells. One of the trials was designed to treat patients with - who have Stargardt's disease, which is the most common pediatric macular degeneration. And the second trial was to treat patients who have dry AMD, which is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. ROBERT LANZA : And in both studies, we turn the embryonic stem cells into cells known as retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE cells, and those were injected under the retina into the sub-retinal space of the patients. And these RPE cells are responsible for maintaining the health of the photoreceptors, which we see with. ROBERT LANZA : So in both of these degenerative eye diseases, which are currently untreatable, there's a loss of these RPE cells, which leads to a loss of the photoreceptors and then blindness. So we were hoping that by adding new, healthy RPE cells, we might be able to prevent this process from occurring. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Was this sort of a proof of concept stage? ROBERT LANZA : Well actually, this is a Phase 1/2 study. So it was essentially just to test the safety of the cells. We were actually going in in these first two patients with the lowest possible dose. These again, are patients with very advanced stage disease. So we weren't expecting to see any real efficacy at this early point. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you did find, at least in one of the patients provability that something was happening? ROBERT LANZA : Absolutely. You know, it's first important to point out that when you measure visual improvements in patients with low vision, this is very difficult. There's no consensus in part because of current - there's currently no treatments. But that being said, the vision in both patients appears to have improved after transplantation of the cells, again even at the lowest dose. ROBERT LANZA : So before treatment, the Stargardt's patient could only detect hand motions. But within a week after treatment, she was able to actually start counting fingers. Indeed before the treatment, she couldn't read any letters on the standard visual acuity chart, but by two weeks, she started reading letters, and by one month, she could actually read five letters. ROBERT LANZA : But I think it's important to point out that that doesn't really capture the difference that this makes in their life. So for instance the Stargardt's patient reports she can now see more color, and she's a graphic artist, so of course that's very important to her. She had better contrast and dark adaptation out of the operated eye. ROBERT LANZA : For instance, the dry AMD patient can now use her computer again. She can even read her watch. So little things like that, which we all take for granted, obviously can make a huge difference in the quality of a person's life. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You've got to agree that two patients is hardly enough for a larger conclusion. ROBERT LANZA : Absolutely. It's very important to point out that there could also be a placebo component to this improvement. But I think there's enough objective data to suggest that there's a very real biological signal, and these are obviously very preliminary data, so we need to interpret the results very cautiously until we have more data and in more patients. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Are there more patients in trials? ROBERT LANZA : Yeah, so we have two clinical trials. The first, for Stargardt's, involves 12 patients. And the second study, the dry AMD, is another 12 patients. And just recently, last Friday, we started a new study in Europe, the first in Europe, where we started treating another group of 12 patients who have Stargardt's disease. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, is this true that this is the first use of human embryonic stem cells in patients? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### ROBERT LANZA : Well, no, there have been three trials that have been approved by the FDA. One was Geron for spinal cord injuries. They have halted that study. And then these two studies. So these are actually the first published results that are indicating what we might expect to see. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you bring up a good point. If Geron is now out of the human embryonic stem cells business, right? ROBERT LANZA : Right, from what we can understand from public statements, they didn't see any biological effect, which of course makes it difficult to have a therapy. So again, they were early-stage trials, as well. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So that, like, puts it on your back, does it not, to continue? ROBERT LANZA : Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, for 13 years, everyone's been talking about embryonic stem cells, and so they're saying, well, does it work, does it work? So I think this is the very first time that we have some signals that something very real seems to be happening. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Could you actually see regrowing of the damaged area? ROBERT LANZA : Yes, this is a very interesting thing. When you treat the eye, you can actually look into the eye and see what's going on in real time. So we can actually see with very high-resolution instruments right down to the cellular level. And we could actually see, beginning at the first week, an increase in the pigmentation that continued throughout the study period. ROBERT LANZA : And we also had these OCT, these high-resolution instruments, that showed engraphtment of the cells in spots where there weren't any cells prior to the treatment. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, I understand that actually, if the cells were just sitting in a Petri dish in the lab, you can watch them grow right there. ROBERT LANZA : Yeah, it's very interesting, yes. In a Petri dish, it turns out that these embryonic stem cells like to do all the tricks - they make all the cell types that are in the eye. So in addition to seeing, for instance, these retinal pigment epithelium, we also can see photoreceptors and the various neuronal cells, the bipolar cells. So they almost want to assemble into an eye in the Petri dish. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so how do you keep them from assembling into other things besides the eye once you put them into someone's eye? ROBERT LANZA : Exactly. So that's why this has taken so long to get into the clinic, at least in part. So when they're left on their own, these embryonic stem cells will turn into a hodgepodge of cell types. So in part of the dish, you might see cartilage or nerve cell and then in another section some beating heart cells. ROBERT LANZA : So the main issue is how to turn those reliably into the desired replacement cell type. And in fact, we're still just learning how to do that with some cell types. But fortuitously, it turns out that these cells like to become retinal pigment epithelium. So you - in almost all these cultures, they will eventually have little freckles of pigmentation, which are RPE cells, and those cells expand very, very nicely. So we can take very small patches and turn them into literally millions of these cells. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you took these from embryonic stem cells. ROBERT LANZA : Yes, so we actually started out with a single cell from a leftover IVF embryo, and we turned that cell into a embryonic stem cell line, which of course are the body's master cells. So they can become virtually every cell type in the body. ROBERT LANZA : And since these cells are immortal, they can provide an unlimited supply of starting material. So for these studies, we turned those stem cells into these RPE cells, which were then frozen down, then shipped off to the clinical site. And then after they're reformulated, they can then be injected to a fine kenular(ph) into the subretinal space of the patient. And actually it's an outpatient procedure. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is it true that you have pioneered a way of getting the embryonic stem cells out of the embryo without destroying the embryo? ROBERT LANZA : Yes, I mean, obviously there are some people, such as former President Bush, who think it's wrong to, quote-unquote, \"destroy one life to save another.\" So we developed another method that's routinely used in IVF clinics around the world known as PGD. ROBERT LANZA : And this method allows you to remove one cell from an embryo without destroying it. And then we take that cell, instead of using it for genetic testing, we turn it into stem cells, and we now have several of these lines that we can use in the future where no embryos were destroyed. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How many cells do you have to inject into the eye to get it... \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan broadcasting today from member station WMFE in Orlando. For many Americans, the exploration of space represents a bold venture on behalf of both the nation and our species. But here in Central Florida, it's also an important industry. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For decades, NASA provided high-tech jobs in Houston of course, in Huntsville, Alabama, and many other places and many thousands of jobs at Cape Canaveral, just down the road. The cancelation of the shuttle program meant pink slips for some 9,000 people who used to work at the Kennedy Space Center. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But while some leave to look for work elsewhere, others hope that private industry can restore the future of Florida's Space Coast. So space workers, wherever you are around the country, where do you see your future? Our phone number is 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, the prescription drug epidemic in Florida fueled by pill mills. But first, the future of space. Nicole Creston is a reporter and afternoon host here at member station WMFE and joins us here in their studios - actually I'm in her studio. Nice to have you with us today. NICOLE CRESTON : Pleasure to be here, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Can the private space industry ever replace all those jobs along the Space Coast? NICOLE CRESTON : Well, I'm hearing from some experts that the answer is: eventually, but it will look very different than it has for the last 50 years and some change. There's been one big program, obviously, the space shuttle program. There's been one sort of entity that all of the workers, some 15,000 workers, have worked on. NICOLE CRESTON : But now you're looking at kind of a new paradigm. Just last week, NASA went to the administration and told them that they had sort of a new way of looking at their culture, much more diversified is what we're looking at. NICOLE CRESTON : Kennedy Space Center would be, instead of working on one project, an eclectic mix. NASA will be over here in one area, maybe the Department of Energy is over here in another area working on alternative energy technology, and over here there's the commercial space industry park, and so on. NICOLE CRESTON : So could we have all of those jobs back? Yes, but it's going to take some five to 10 years, probably at the minimum. In the meantime, there's some work but nowhere near as much. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The astronauts, American astronauts that go into space, currently ride on Russian rockets, and it looks like it's going to be that way at least until some commercial company develops the ability to launch astronauts up to the International Space Station. NICOLE CRESTON : That is absolutely true, and there's a lot of competition for it. Right now, it looks like SpaceX may be the leader of the pack on that specific issue. About a year - well, their full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corporation. They have a test version that they launched of the Dragon Capsule, and that made them officially the first private business to send a spacecraft into orbit and return it safely, which is of course a very big deal. NICOLE CRESTON : It was supposed to make its first unmanned cargo run to the International Space Station on February 7th, so - but they've just announced they're pushing that back until mid-March at the earliest because more testing is needed. So we'll see how that shakes out. NICOLE CRESTON : But in the meantime, yes, it's - Russian Soyuz capsule that is providing all of the back and forth. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So, the next American astronaut to ride on an American rocket, the patch on their shoulder might say Boeing or, you know, something like that, as opposed to saying NASA. NICOLE CRESTON : It may, Boeing, SpaceX. There are many private companies out there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as we look at the culture of this place, it has been one of those permanent industries. Ever since John Kennedy - well, before that, the space program was already booming, but the challenge to get to the moon within the decade and the Apollo program, it really seemed like this was a permanent part of the infrastructure here in Florida. NICOLE CRESTON : Absolutely. I mean, everything down to the area code, which is 321. You don't get that for nothing. Apparently, a politician went and fought for that. Street names, school names, restaurants called Shuttles, everything about that area has space ingrained into the culture. It's really been quite a blow and a huge surprise, and it's going to look very different when this sort of diversified KSC comes to fruition. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Huge surprise? Everybody knew the space shuttle program was coming to an end. NICOLE CRESTON : Well, that's true. Since 2004, in fact. But everyone sort of expected that there would be another large program waiting in the wings, the large Constellation Program that would keep not all of the workers but a large piece of the workers from the shuttle program. And of course that changed. \n\n ###",

We're not exactly sure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We think of this as a federal program. There's also the state of Florida that's involved, and there's plenty of money, well, at least there used to be plenty of money, in the state budget to try to ensure that there were projects to employ all those people here on the Space Coast. NICOLE CRESTON : Yes, Space Florida. In fact, they are involved in getting the money looking for the new diversification programs. There are the Economic Development Commissions from our county, where Kennedy Space Center is. And they had retraining programs. They offered resume rewriting for people who were being laid off because they'd simply been with the shuttle program for so long they didn't have to think about those things 20, 25 years. NICOLE CRESTON : They offered everything that they could, but it's been quite a difficult transition. Space Florida has been working with the laid-off workers, but it's still hard for them to find work. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what about the next generation? Not only engineers moved here, their children grew up here and went to school and went to various universities to come back and work in the space industry, too. This was family project. NICOLE CRESTON : That's absolutely true, and it's not as bad as you might think, looking at the future of the aerospace industry. It is going to be slow for the next few years, as we've been discussing, but this focus on diversification is going to create some more jobs. That's kind of where it's at, so to speak. NICOLE CRESTON : Kennedy Space Center, which mostly obviously focused on launch operations; it'll have more technology, development, medical advances, propulsion systems, alternative energy as I mentioned, innovations from creative minds as it partners with private industry. And the future of aerospace jobs, I've actually spoke to a couple of experts who are pretty optimistic about it, that we're really just beginning to discover the economic and commercial potential that space offers. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from those experts out there in the audience. If you work in the space industry, or maybe if you used to work in the space industry, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. We'd like to know where you see your future and, well, not only in industrial terms but in physical terms. If there's going to be an American space program, is much of it going to be here on the Space Coast in Florida or elsewhere around the country? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Again, the phone number is 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. And when you're talking about this very slow growth here in Florida, well, there was this enormous infrastructure. All of these people - and I'm talking about the talent, the workers - all of these people who were here, who had the ability to make these things work, is it all going to be dispersed? Is it all going to be - take a lot of time and money to re-create. NICOLE CRESTON : That's absolutely true. And Space Florida and those other entities that we talked about were trying to keep that talent here because it's an immense pool of incredibly intelligent and very talented people. But there's been a lot of dispersal already. As I said, people are moving to areas where there are other aerospace hubs. And I just recently spoke to one former space worker. He worked in ground operations there for more than 20 years, now he's working at one of the local theme parks on the graveyard shift. NICOLE CRESTON : It just - some of the lucky ones stay and are working on the - from the ground-up sort of ops for the new heavy-lift program that NASA's going to be doing, but a lot of them have left the area. NEAL CONAN, HOST : New heavy-lift program, we mentioned that they're going to rely on essentially taxis provided by commercial companies to get up to the International Space Station. The heavy lift, that's for exploration to the asteroids and to the planets and beyond. NICOLE CRESTON : Yes, the planets and beyond: Mars, moons of Mars, way out there. It's - they're calling it the SLS, the Space Launch System. It's basically designed to be a very big booster to put a big piece of cargo really far out there, as we said; to Mars, the moons of mars, to go as far - to do something new, to go as far as we can. And that's sort of the vision for NASA itself, is to go places that we've never gone. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is also a question of focus and a question of marketing. In the 1960s, it seemed obvious why we needed a manned space program. Well, for one thing, the options were limited. Men needed to do a lot of the work in space. But nevertheless, there was also the competition with the Soviet Union. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, yes, there - they Chinese were involved, yes the Europeans are involved, yes, the Russians of course are still involved. But is Florida, are the people here engaged in trying to make sure the rest of the country understands why we need to do something and what that something is and why we should focus on that and spend all this money? NICOLE CRESTON : Oh yes, they are very engaged. Our lawmakers are. Our individuals are. I spoke to - back in July, the people who were going to be laid off in the final wave, so to speak, of that 9,000 people, and you should feel the pride of those - the pride of the project and what they worked on, what they've accomplished, how far they've gone and what we can learn. NICOLE CRESTON : I mean, medical advances have been made in space. There's research that's done in space that can't be done anywhere else. It's surprising. There is often the question: why do we have the space program. And the answer is there are endless possibilities for technology developments, for research and development that can't be done anywhere else. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Nicole Creston, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host and reporter here at member station WMFE in Orlando, where she does a lot of stories, as you might expect, on space. Space workers, where do you see your future? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. We'll be coming back to talk with Jeff Greason, who is the president and CEO of XCOR Aerospace, which is a privately held rocket company working with NASA. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But we also want to hear from you. Space workers, where do you see your future? Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan at member station WMFE in Orlando, about an hour from the Kennedy Space Center, talking about the future of U.S. space program. Clearly, budget cuts and other changes have had a lasting effect along the Space Coast here in Florida. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But the end of the shuttle program, at least according to NASA, by no means the end of U.S. ambitions in space. Just a few weeks ago, twin NASA satellites entered into orbit around the moon. Later this year, SpaceX hopes to become the first private company to rendezvous a capsule with the International Space Station. NASA continues to work on rockets and crew capsules, among other technologies. \n\n ###",

But it's worth pointing out this note that came today from Space.com. During his State of the Union address, President Obama did not mention NASA or his vision for deep-space exploration of the asteroids and Mars. He did emphasize the need for innovation to remain competitive in the fields of sciences and technology. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Obama's speech comes a day after Republican presidential candidate debates took place in Florida, where candidates Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich made statements. They called for a leaner NASA and more support for private space industry initiatives. So that gives you some indication of the national debate on this issue. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Space workers, where do you see your future? Our phone number is 800-989-8255, email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr.org. And you just click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Our guest is Nicole Creston, a host and reporter for member station WMFE. Joining us now from Mojave, California is Jeff Greason, president and CEO of XCOR Aerospace, a privately held rocket company working with NASA. He served on the Augustine Committee that reviewed NASA's Human Flight Program for the Obama administration. Good of you to be with us today. JEFF GREASON : Nice to be with you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let me ask you two questions: How important is the space industry going to be in the future? And how much of it is going to be on Florida's Space Coast? JEFF GREASON : I think the space industry will continue to be a growing part of both the U.S. and the world economy in the future. I think how much of it is on Florida's coast is going to be tied to the policy choices that we make as a nation in what we do with the federal government's space program, with the NASA space program. JEFF GREASON : A lot of people talk about that as if that was something that was going to happen to us, but the future of what NASA is a choice that we make, it's not a destiny, and there are multiple things we can do with the nation's space program, and some of them might have a very bright future for Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But it is not necessarily so, in other words. If there's going to be lots of launches, they could come from a lot of different places. JEFF GREASON : Well, I think the - that's certainly true that, you know, it could be good, it could be bad. It depends on the choices that we make. The Cape has a natural advantage as a launch site for expendable large boosters, and really the choice that hasn't been clearly brought into focus in national policy is if we wanted to select a policy that was good for Florida, we would select a policy that had a lot of launches. JEFF GREASON : And, you know, the more launches there are, the more activity that there will tend to be at the Cape. That's not the only thing that can be done in Florida, but that's an area where Florida has a real advantage over other sites. And it's a challenge, if I may say, in the current posture of our program is that we are, as was discussed earlier, putting our energies towards the development of a larger booster that would fly less often. And that's not necessarily such a great thing for Florida. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Is that one of the projects you're working on? JEFF GREASON : No, we have - NASA is a very small part of our customer base. We're primarily focused on the private sector markets. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And those are smaller rockets designed to lift satellites into orbit? JEFF GREASON : Designed to lift satellites or, in the case of our own company, we're focused on sub-orbital missions carrying people or payloads up to space and directly back down. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so those are projects that are, well, not as employee-rich as some of the NASA projects we've seen in the past. JEFF GREASON : Well, that's quite true. You know, one of the - you know, the market is demanding more cost-effective, more reliable space transportation. One of the consequences of most cost-effective space transportation is it doesn't use as many people per launch. And that means if you want to employ a lot of people in the space sector, which I'm all in favor of, we need to do more launches. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Chuck, and Chuck's on the line with us from Lansing in Michigan. CHUCK : Hi, I'm a longtime friend of Jeff's. We've known each other for maybe 15 years now. How are you doing, Jeff? JEFF GREASON : I'm doing well, thank you. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### CHUCK : The - I just want to follow up on Jeff's comment about commercial because the - one of the drivers that would really bring a lot of the all-the-way-to-orbit launch activity to the Space Coast would be providing a robust commercial environment to allow companies like Bigelow Aerospace to essentially implement their business plan. CHUCK : They're talking about doing larger, purely commercial space facilities that could take the technologies and products and some of the spinouts from the International Space Station and make, you know, real commercial, you know, no-kidding, economy-on-the-ground type stuff that would require dozens of launches a year. CHUCK : Last year at the FAA conference, Bigelow, Mr. Bigelow published his manifest, which talked about 20 or 25 launches per year. The entire manifest for the space station is, you know, four or six. So that would be the big driver for really bringing lots of activity back to the Space Coast to support commercial activity and not have to rely on NASA budgets to do it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nicole Creston, Bigelow is one of the companies you're familiar with? NICOLE CRESTON : Yes, it's run by a billionaire from Las Vegas. He is a hotel chain owner. In orbit in fact now he has two test models, 12-feet-by-8-feet inflatable space stations, which is very interesting to think about. NICOLE CRESTON : NASA sold him the licensing rights of that, and he does want to provide access to those space stations to universities, to smaller countries that can't get their own access into space or to space tourism. NICOLE CRESTON : But it's interesting question, space tourism, because I hear some experts that say that that's a place to focus, and then some others say, well, you may run out of people that are wealthy enough that want to see the black of space. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeff Greason, I have to say the first thing I hear when I hear inflatable space station is meteorite. JEFF GREASON : You'll have to discuss the details with Bigelow, the company, but I hope they discuss that publicly because the inflatable station is made of many, many layers. It actually is substantially more resistant to meteoroids than a thin aluminum skin, as on the International Space Station today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh good. NICOLE CRESTON : Yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But what about the prospect - and just this is as an industry observer, rather than for your company in particular, about the prospects for space tourism? JEFF GREASON : Space tourism is, I think, going to be an important market. I think people like to talk about it as if it were the only market, and that's certainly not true. There's plenty of things to do in space that are on a purely commercial basis. But there's also nothing wrong with people paying their own way. JEFF GREASON : You know, high net worth people being early adopters of products and services is how we have gotten mass-market acceptance of almost all the technologies that we take for granted today. I know a lot of these people who want to pay their own way. They're dreamers who have dreamed of going to space and space happening their whole lives, and they want to use some of the wealth that they've put together in their life to try to bring that day closer for everybody, and I think that's great. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Chuck, thanks very much for the call. CHUCK : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Maggie(ph): I got my bachelor's in astronautical engineering at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, and I'm currently working on my master's at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. I'm 24. Being in the Air Force will allow me to be active in the DOD's space program, which is flourishing. GPS, weather, communications satellites will be constants in the field and will always provide jobs. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I did minor in Russian because I dream of being an astronaut, so I really hope manned space flight becomes a reality again. Space needs to be a commercialized space that makes money or the industry will suffer. That's our job as engineers, to find space's economic worth. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Nicole, that's one of the things we did not mention, of course, the Defense Department - very active in space. NICOLE CRESTON : Oh absolutely. In fact, I went to an engineering job, aerospace job website, and saw a lot of listings for the Department of Defense. And I do want to point out that there are still a number of launches that are happening out at Kennedy Space Center. They are mostly at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, and they are communications satellites, Delta rockets, Atlas rockets with these types of things attached. So yes, very active. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Martin in Denver: I work for a large aerospace defense company here in Denver. We're undergoing a major shift in the space industry, which is analogous to where the aviation industry was in the 1920s and '30s. This period saw the rise of non-government, i.e., civilian aviation in the form of civil air transportation, private aircraft operators, which led to today's airline, commercial and general aviation industries. Leaving space transportation entirely to the government is like the Federal Aviation Administration operating the sole U.S. airline. I, for one, am excited about the future of American space operations. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Jeff Greason, is that a viable analogy, do you think? JEFF GREASON : I absolutely think so. And, you know - but it's important not to overstate the case. Government continued to play a role in making that transition in aviation in the '20s and '30s. But the role that they played was not to set up a national airline. The role that they played was to set up elements such as airmail, where the government could use their limited resources to help stimulate markets that also had private customers. And that, I think, is the most productive area for our nation's civil space program to focus on. Where can NASA purchase services and products that will help NASA do its missions, but will also enlarge the pool of customers for critical capabilities that are also available to private markets? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Somebody to send mail to, perhaps. Let's see if we'd get another caller in. This is James, and James is with us from Denver. JAMES : Yes. Hi. I just called in to make a comment. You know, I feel like a big problem that the U.S. space program has is that the public never really seems to have a firm grasp on what exactly we're doing. You know, we always flew up these missions with the shuttle and ran experiments that I feel like a lot of the public didn't really understand what they were about. And going forward, you know, we're talking about asteroids and other things. And I think what the program, the space program really needs is a clear-cut and bold mission that the public can get excited about, like they did with Apollo, you know, something like colonizing the moon or colonizing Mars, something that people can really understand and get enthusiastic about. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet, Jeff Greason, people have outlined projects like that. It was President Bush who said we need to go back to the moon. It was President Obama who said, I think, we need to go to Mars, and people don't seem to get excited. JEFF GREASON : This is a subject I care a lot about. I think Apollo has really cast a long shadow on how we think about space. And even the caller, that I agree with, cast it in terms of a mission that we should care about. We don't need a mission that we should care about. We need a purpose that we should care about, and the missions are just tools in the job of serving that purpose. JEFF GREASON : I think that space, and including manned spaceflight, can be opening a frontier that brings real economic and social benefits to us here on planet Earth. But to do that, we have to be much bolder than we have been in decades in what we do in space. We don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money, but we have to spend that money as if we cared what we were going to get for it, not to spend it for the act of spending it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nicole? NICOLE CRESTON : Well, I've heard references of a gold rush in space, if you will. I've heard some experts say the first person to get rich in space will cause the excitement, and he may not be wrong. I've also heard it mentioned that if we learn how to mine the platinum - apparently, there's a lot of platinum on the moon, apparently there is something called helium-3, which, if we learn how to process it correctly, we could have a new energy source from it. NICOLE CRESTON : Those would be important and economic engines and important things that would - that could change the world. These may be the things that we need to focus on in our - at least in the marketing. Let the public know those are the things that we're working on. That's the kind of research and development that is being worked on by the space program. NEAL CONAN, HOST : James, thanks very much for the call. We're talking with Nicole Creston, who you just heard here at WMFE. Jeff Greason is also with us, the president and CEO of XCOR Aerospace. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Ron: There's another great program waiting in the wings. The loss of 9,000 jobs to the closing of the space shuttle program would be a greater loss if all those great technological minds went to waste. Many of these people are engineers whose whole lives have been spent geared toward making things that are more fuel-efficient, more compact and lighter weight. Why not restructure that program for the development of new technology that would be great for the nation, one in which there's still time for the USA to become the last great leader in? The space shuttle program should be re-geared toward the development of electric vehicles to take the place of gasoline-powered transportation at the end of the carbon age. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeff Greason, I'm not sure that's the bold goal that you are aiming for. JEFF GREASON : Well, I believe that there are economic goods that we can achieve by doing the right things in space. If we can, I think we should. If we can't, we don't need the government to re-allocate the resources of all those bright minds into other projects where they will be more economically valued. That's the kind of thing that markets are good at. You know, whenever - you know, we do not anymore retain - as I sometimes say, we don't have the infrastructure to make 1960 Corvettes anymore, but we don't regard that as a national tragedy. Those engineers went on to make other things. JEFF GREASON : The issue is not this job versus that job. The issue is if we want to continue to be a vibrant nation in our government space program, we have to figure out what we want to get out of it, and then we can ask the question of how should we structure it to get those things? NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I have to ask you. Yes, there was one huge project, NASA, which produced huge budgets, huge numbers of jobs and, of course, huge rockets, as well. As we look toward the future - and, Jeff Greason, your company is just one of many - there's going to be a lot of different ideas out there, a lot of competing proposals. Who's going to decide which go forward? Is it going to be the government? Is it going to be the market? JEFF GREASON : That's a great question. And I think the answer ought to be the market. But the government is and will be a participant in that market. And the greatest step forward we could take is for the government to select the services it wants to buy on the basis of cost and quality rather than on the basis of which contractor and which state is going to get the job. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it. Jeff Greason is president and CEO of XCOR Aerospace, a privately held rocket company that works with NASA, among other clients. He joined us today from his office via Skype in Mojave, California.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : Disputes on climate change are often presented in the familiar paradigm of a court case with scientists as prosecutors, skeptics as the defense, and the rest of us the jury awaiting the ruling of a judge. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In an op-ed piece in The Los Angeles Times, historian Naomi Oreskes objects. She argues that most of the skeptics are shills, scientists are, in fact, the jury, and that their verdict has long since been handed down. Naomi Oreskes is the co-author of \"Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth About Climate Change,\" and joins us now from a winter vacation in Snowmass, Colorado. And thanks very much for taking a break today to speak with us. NAOMI ORESKES : Thank you, Neal. Can you hear me? NEAL CONAN, HOST : We can. NAOMI ORESKES : Good. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I have to say that while the vast majority of scientists agree the Earth is warming as a result of human activity, a vast majority does not mean unanimity. It's not unanimous. NAOMI ORESKES : No, of course not. And, you know, I'm a historian of science. Most of my work is focused on the question of how scientists do evaluate evidence and judge the data that they collect from the natural world. And, so of course, in any scientific community, there will always be people who have dissenting opinions, and that's fine. Nobody really has a problem with that. The problem is when it's misrepresented. The problem is when a normal give and take of scientific debate is misrepresented to make it seem different than it really is. NAOMI ORESKES : So in the scientific community today - and not just today, but actually for the last 10 years at least if not longer - there has been a general consensus that climate change was underway. And we're talking about climate change caused by things that people do. Not the normal ups and downs of weather and natural variability, but a different new phenomenon caused by greenhouse gases and deforestation. There has been general agreement in the scientific community about this issue for quite some time now. The vast, vast majority of scientists who work on this issue would agree with that statement. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you draw, again, an analogy to a court case, you were serving as a juror recently and say that, you know, in a sense, we should not be open-minded. What did you mean by that? NAOMI ORESKES : Well, right. And I was, of course, being a little deliberately provocative, but the point I was trying to make was drawing on an analogy with the jury. This was a great experience because we had a wonderful judge, and one of the things she said to us at the very beginning - and I wrote about this in the op-ed piece - she asked us at the very beginning during jury selection: If I sent you out right now and then asked you to come back - and this is before we turn any evidence and before the jury had even been impaneled - if I asked you, do you think these people, the defendants, are guilty, not guilty or you don't know enough to know. And the vast majority of people in the room raised their hands for we don't know enough to know. And the judge said: That's the wrong answer, that in this case, open-mindedness is not the correct answer because the law establishes a presumption of innocence. NAOMI ORESKES : The law tells us that those defendants are innocent, presumed innocent until the prosecution has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt. And it was a kind of eureka moment for me because I thought, oh, of course, the judge is completely correct here. We think of open-mindedness as a virtue. And in many walks of life it is a virtue, but there are some situations when the situation calls for something else. In the courtroom, it calls for us to assume that the defendants are innocent until the state makes its case against them. NAOMI ORESKES : So then I thought about, well, what about in the case of science? Well, science is a little different. It's not exactly the same as a courtroom. Innocence and guilt don't really make much sense when we're talking about science in the natural world. So then the question becomes, well, who is making this judgment? And so the argument I was trying to point out is that, as ordinary citizens, many of us feel, well, we don't know what to think. You know, we've heard a lot of conflicting things about climate change so - and I've heard many people say to me, I'm open-minded about it. NAOMI ORESKES : And so the argument I was trying to make was to say, well, in this case, being open-minded - although it might sound good at first and may sound good in principle - it actually doesn't make sense when you have now more than half a century of accumulated scientific data put together by thousands of different scientists all around the world, men and women, black and white, Republicans, Democrats, you know, all, you know, very diverse scientific community, over half a century of work. At this point, to say that you're still open-minded is to really be ignoring this huge body of scientific evidence that really points to a very, very strong conclusion. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Naomi Oreskes, professor of history and science, professor at the University of California, San Diego. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. If the evidence is so overwhelming, why is it that this argument seems to be losing traction? NAOMI ORESKES : Right. Well, this is the subject of a book which I published last year with my co-author Erik Conway called \"Merchants of Doubt.\" And in the book, we asked exactly that question. We said, well, if there's so much scientific evidence, why do so many of us have the impression of a raging scientific debate? And so we've spent five years researching this question. And, you know, it's funny for me because it's funny for me to even be having to have this conversation, because I first published on the scientific consensus on climate change back in 2003. So I've now been working on the consensus piece for almost a decade. NAOMI ORESKES : But for the last five years, Erik Conway and I have been working on this question why so many of us think there's a raging debate. And what we showed in the book is that there have been systematic efforts organized by people outside the scientific community to undermine the scientific data and to convince all of us that the jury - scientific jury was still out in order to delay government, business and community action on taking steps to prevent further manmade climate change. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A conspiracy theory. NAOMI ORESKES : No, it's not a conspiracy theory. It's a history. We're describing events that had happened. We're describing the things that people have done. There are organizations. There are networks. It's not a conspiracy in the sense that it's not taking place in smoke-filled rooms. In fact, one of the sort of remarkable things about our book was that we were able to show how much of this activity took place in open air, in plain sight. A lot of the research we did wasn't actually that difficult to do. Many of the documents we found were in the public record. NAOMI ORESKES : So it's not a conspiracy in the sense of, you know, creepy, evil people in backrooms doing terrible things. No. It's actually out in the open, which in some ways makes it more shocking and in a way more alarming that the media haven't done more to talk about the events that have actually taken place in the last five years to convince the American people that there was a debate, you know, an argument that really flew in their face of a huge amount of evidence. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is a - your case is not bolstered when stories come out. This publication of emails by scientists in England who seem to be, though not fabricating data, suppressing publication of data that seem to fly in the face of their conclusions. \n\n ###",

Flora Lichtman, our multimedia editor is here. Hi, Flora. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Hi, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Good video as always. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. This one is about something that I encounter every day, and I think of it as little more than a beverage cooler or maybe a nuisance on my commute to work. I'm talking about ice. But it turns out that ice was way more interesting than I knew before (unintelligible)... IRA FLATOW, HOST : You got... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : It's much more than... IRA FLATOW, HOST : You got up close and personal with a bunch of ice... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah, I did. So we went to Shintaro Okamoto's ice sculpting studio in Queens, and he is an ice expert for sure. And we also spoke with an ice researcher, the head of Dartmouth's ice research lab. I didn't even know there was such a thing as an ice research lab. But this guy, Erland Schulson, actually founded it and learned about ice's slippery properties. I mean that figuratively too. IRA FLATOW, HOST : This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Flora Lichtman, who's discovering that ice an amazing... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : It's amazing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : ...an amazing, amazing substance. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : I heard from both of these ice experts who are experts in these sort of different ways, right? One is an artist... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : ...and the other is a scientist. But they both said the thing, that ice is full of these mysterious contradictions. For instance, ice can be cloudy, or it can be crystal clear. Ice can be as soft as a snowflake or as hard as concrete. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. And you went to his - their studio where they have these chainsaws buzzing... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Well... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : ...and cutting up the ice and making ice sculptures, right? IRA FLATOW, HOST : When you're dealing with something as hard as concrete, you have to bring out some serious power tools. And so they said that, actually, 60 to 70 percent of the sculpting work is done with chainsaws, sort of brute work, says Shintaro Okamoto. SHINTARO OKAMOTO : The process is quite, kind of, root, you know, with these power tools. And the finished product is so much about this kind of fragility and, you know, elegance, and it's kind of funny to see some of these ice sculptors who present themselves as just like these macho guys and they create hearts and swans, you know?

And it took a couple hours to do the sculpting. And once you start, obviously, you're not - you can't stop, because it's melting as they're sculpting. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you saw - we see the video there, and then we see the - some commentary about the physics of ice and how it forms. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. One of the most interesting things I learned - did you know this, why ice is cloudy and some ice is clear? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hey, you noticed that. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : You see it all the time, but what - I found out the answer. It turns out that it's tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice that makes the difference between cloudy and clear ice. So cloudy ice has these little bubbles trapped and that scatters the light. So for Okamoto, there's ways to make ice - specialty ice with no bubbles. But you know, you learn about as they go. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. He's making 300-pound slabs (unintelligible). FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : It's not your average IQ. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But one thing on video - I saw a video (unintelligible) covering up the ice, is that he has to let the ice sort of sit for a while, right, the giant block of ice. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You  just can't hack at it. It has to, like, cure or something. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Acclimate. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Acclimate. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. I like the curing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : It has to acclimate. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. It can't be - because it's all - this is another sort of interesting material science thing. It comes out of the freezer and it's all one temperature, right? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : And it's really cold. And even on a day like we were there - it was in the 40s maybe in the studio, which is another thing - but you have to let the ice warm up. And if you cut into it too quickly, it will crack and burst, and that's because as it's warming up, the outer layer is actually warming up faster than the inside. And as it warms up, it expands, and so it creates this strain between the outer skin of the ice and the inner part. And this is apparently what causes cracks on ponds too. That's what Erland Schulson said. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. So you're learning - when you watch this video, it's up on our website at sciencefriday.com, and as you watch the ice sculpture going on, Flora has magically integrated some wonderful commentary about what the physics of ice and how it all works. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : I snuck in a tiny bit of science. IRA FLATOW, HOST : There's a lot of it, yeah. Well, it's very - it's beautiful. The stuff that make is absolutely gorgeous.

I'm Ira Flatow. After the Deepwater Horizon spill, BP poured nearly two million gallons of dispersants into the Gulf of Mexico. The goal, of course, is breaking up oil slicks, making them dissolve into ocean waters, sort of like how you squirt dish soap on a greasy frying pan to get the oil to wash away with the water. IRA FLATOW, HOST : The problem is, after you dump all that soap into the Gulf, the soap stays there. My next guest has developed something that could be the solution: the soap that has iron in it so that you can suck up the soap with a magnet. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How do they do it? Could we really use something like this next time there's a big oil spill? Julian Eastoe is a professor in the School of Chemistry at the University of Bristol in the U.K. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JULIAN EASTOE : Hello, Ira, from the United Kingdom. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thanks for joining - how did you get this idea? It sounds so simple yet so easy. JULIAN EASTOE : Well, to explain that, I'd like to propose an interactive experiment for you and your listeners. Would that be OK? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Absolutely. JULIAN EASTOE : Well, the experiment works best if you're in the kitchen. So go over to the fridge and take one of those picture fridge magnets, you know, with Niagara Falls, Las Vegas or Disneyland on it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. JULIAN EASTOE : And now go over to the kitchen sink with the magnet. Next put the magnet against the bottle of dish soap. Right. What happens? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Nothing. JULIAN EASTOE : Absolutely nothing. JULIAN EASTOE : That's because normal soap is not magnetic. Just as you said, you can't control where it goes. Gravity does that, just sucks it down the drain. Now, Ira, we've been making soaps and surfactants with unusual properties for some years. Have you ever thought of a soap you could turn on with the flick of a switch, a light-sensitive surfactant? We made one of those about five years ago. JULIAN EASTOE : And next we thought why not try magnets. Would it be possible to make surfactants or soaps that respond to magnets? Well, if that's true, then you stand a chance to control where the soap does and where it doesn't go. Our motivation for this was just good old-fashioned scientific inquisitiveness. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So you created this soap that is magnetic so that the soap dissolves the grease, keeps the grease with it, and then you can just magnetize it away with a magnet? JULIAN EASTOE : Yeah, it sounds incredible, but it's true. I mean, I was witnessing the experiments in my laboratory at the University of Bristol this afternoon with graduate students. We were making emulsions with lube oil, our magnetic soap, and we were moving them around using magnets. The emulsions can be collected up. It's amazing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, I've - I've got an experiment for you now. Tell me if this is possible. Let's say that you can put your - you can disperse your magnetic soap into a harbor. Can you magnetize the hulls of ships so that they sort of scoot around the harbor soaking up all the grease collecting on their hulls, and then you just clean them off when they get back to the harbor? JULIAN EASTOE : Well, Ira, I hadn't thought about that. It sounds feasible to me, but I think we would have to do some tests in the laboratory. I'm not sure about if you can maintain magnetism in the hull of a ship. IRA FLATOW, HOST : A-ha, but you think you can do this with an oil spill by collecting up all the grease later on? JULIAN EASTOE : Well, in principle that's right. That's what we demonstrated in the laboratory. The - we started with chemicals that are relatives of common or garden(ph)  soaps. We kept the organic part of the molecule, the one which dissolves oily substances, but we chemically modified the ionic part, which makes the compound water soluble. \n\n ###",

We replace the normal ions with magnetic ions. Those ions contain the element iron. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And voila, because the soap molecule, as you say, is fascinating to begin with. One end likes to stick in the grease, one end likes to stick in the water, and that's why it works so well. And you basically took the water end and put a piece of iron in there. JULIAN EASTOE : Yeah, we've done this with iron. That's in the paper, which has been published recently, but we've even used other magnetic units. I can't disclose them right now because they're under a secrecy agreement, but we are now starting to optimize the chemistry, and that is now really exciting. JULIAN EASTOE : I think what this research shows is the first stage in any scientific breakthrough, the essential proof of principle, and once the proof of principle has been established and has been communicated to the scientific community, that's when it gets really interesting. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. JULIAN EASTOE : That's when the collective consciousness, those thousands and thousands of scientific minds get to work coming up with ideas that you would  never have thought of. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, it's - so once you show that this can happen, people will say, you know, this is what I could do with it. Sort of like... JULIAN EASTOE : Now, it was suggested to me, Ira, by somebody from the British equivalent of the Audubon Society - that's the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom - that this could potentially help in the cleanup of those poor seabirds when they get contaminated by oil slicks. IRA FLATOW, HOST : They get washed down with this magnetic soap. JULIAN EASTOE : Yeah, he suggested that maybe with the extra pull from the magnet you would be able to clean off the poor birds more effectively than just using the traditional, you know, dispersants. So I sent a grad student down to the store to get some lube oil and a pillow. We've taken it apart and we're testing that idea right now with down from the pillows that we bought in the store. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm sure the grad students are doing it, right? JULIAN EASTOE : Sure. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You know, once these things happen, you know, like you never know where they're going to end up. I mean, the laser beam was invented to cut steel and razor blades back in the early '60s, but look what it's used for now. You never know where your idea might wind up, where it will end. JULIAN EASTOE : No, that's the really exciting thing about being a scientist, is that you uncover facts and figures that you just do not know where that will lead for the human race. Think about the liquid crystals, which were developed in the U.K. in the 1970s. JULIAN EASTOE : When they developed liquid crystals, they had no idea that it would be an integral part of mobile phones and smartphones, for example, but they certainly don't work without liquid crystals to allow you to interface with the electronics through the screen. And this is the same it could be here with this application, the applications that could come from this magnetic soap. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, let me ask you the $64 question, as we say here in the States. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And it is a $64 question, I guess. Is it cheap enough? You know, can you make... JULIAN EASTOE : Well, in fact, it's interesting that what we started with, a chemical, sort of just the brothers and sisters of those that you would find in household products, we tried to keep it simple here. And the cost of our magnetic soap is already reasonable. It's reasonable enough that it could actually be scaled up. JULIAN EASTOE : Think that the elements that are contained in this soap are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine and iron, all very, very common elements. And therefore the soap that we've made is cheap, commercially viable. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, I wish you the best of luck, and we'll watch to see where your soap shows up, so to speak. \n\n ###",

So Venezuela's economic and political chaos are sending shockwaves across Colombia. Francisco Santos is Colombia's ambassador to the United States, and he joins us now in the studio to discuss the next steps in Venezuela. Welcome. FRANCISCO SANTOS : Ari, it's a pleasure being here. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Just to remind listeners, two men claim to lead Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro is holding onto power. He has the support of Russia and China, among other countries. And many Western countries, including the U.S. and Colombia, support opposition leader Juan Guaido. They've been calling for Maduro to step down, and he refuses. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : So how do you see the stalemate ending? FRANCISCO SANTOS : Let me add something. It's not only Colombia. You have 600,000 Venezuelans in Peru. You have 250,000 Venezuelans in Ecuador. You had 180,000 in Chile, and you have around 100,000 in Argentina. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And so the population is pouring out of the country. FRANCISCO SANTOS : It's a continental crisis. It's something that the Western Hemisphere has not had in its history. So it's a very, very big challenge that can destabilize the whole continent. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And how do you reverse this? FRANCISCO SANTOS : I think, obviously, Maduro must step down. Obviously, what we need is free and fair democratic votes in Venezuela, which is something that was taken away from the Venezuelans many, many years ago. So we're working, all of the countries, to get important members of the military to back Guaido, and I think that's the tipping point. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was in your country, Colombia, this week, where he insisted that all options remain on the table. That includes military options. As ambassador, what have you told the U.S. about that possibility? FRANCISCO SANTOS : We have never discussed anything related to military action. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : At all? You haven't even warned them against it? FRANCISCO SANTOS : No, no. We haven't discussed that. We've worked very clearly in terms of diplomatic pressure, economic pressure. The economic sanctions are only starting to hurt. Probably, there's two or three more weeks of cash that they have, and then they're literally going to run out of cash. So that's another step. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Are you saying you expect this to end in two or three weeks? FRANCISCO SANTOS : No, no, no - that the crisis will deepen and that even the most staunch supporters of Maduro will start looking the other way. And we hope that this will end well, but it can go bad very quickly. For the first time, I heard in the border people saying, we want weapons. And they can get weapons. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Who at the border is asking for weapons? What do you mean there? FRANCISCO SANTOS : The young kids who are throwing rocks at the other side, trying to get the...

MABLEAN EPHRIAM : (As Judge Ephriam) Madea. TYLER PERRY : (As Madea) How you doing, Judge Mablean? It's good to see - oh, your is pretty, girl. Look at you. You're looking good. How you been?

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : That's a clip from \"Diary Of A Mad Black Woman,\" the first of 11 Madea movies. The eleventh drops this weekend, and Tyler Perry, who plays Madea in drag, says this will be the last one in the franchise. It's called \"A Madea Family Funeral.\" Well, to say goodbye and talk about why this character has become such a phenomenon, Lisa France joins us now. She's a senior entertainment writer for CNN Digital. Hi there. LISA FRANCE : Hey, Ari. How's it going? ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Good. So I was just browsing Rotten Tomatoes, and \"Diary Of A Mad Black Woman\" has a 16 percent rating. The most recent Madea film, \"Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,\" has a 5 percent rating, but the franchise has been a huge financial success. How do you explain all of that? LISA FRANCE : Because people love to hate Madea movies. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : (Laughter) OK. LISA FRANCE : It's kind of like a black family reunion. Like, you know someone's going to embarrass you, but you also know you're going to have a great time. So I think it's one of those things where people just don't want to admit how much they enjoy Madea films. And even if they really don't like them, they still like to hate-watch them. They make a lot of money. You don't want to be left out of the conversation when somebody is talking about the latest Madea film. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : What is it about the character that inspires both the love and the hate? LISA FRANCE : Well, you know, Spike Lee has gone on record as saying that the films are kind of like coonery and buffoonery, as he said, that he feels like it's very stereotypical to have this angry black woman. But for many people, it also reminds you of your grandma or your auntie, you know, those people who say whatever. They use their age to their advantage to be able to, you know, curse you out or let you have it. And it's just a very divisive character because on some levels, it's very historical, but on others, it feels very stereotypical. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : These films all have certain themes in common. There's often kind of a family narrative, sometimes a moralistic or Christian streak. Sometimes Madea does kind of - almost, like, public service announcements. This clip is from \"Madea's Family Reunion.\" TYLER PERRY : (As Madea) When you get tired of a man hitting on you, honey, ain't nothing you can do but cook breakfast for him. Bring him into the kitchen, and get you big old pot of hot grits. And when it starts to boil like lava after he had got good and comfortable, you say good morning. Throw it right on him. LISA FRANCE : I mean, right there you have the dichotomy that is Madea - on one hand, incredibly loving, looking out for someone who's being abused but, on the other hand, also violent (laughter). So... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Abuse is a frequent topic in a lot of these movies, which seems like a heavy subject to tackle in slapstick humor. What do you think is the value of returning to it again and again in film after film? LISA FRANCE : I think because it's one way for us to have the discussion and, in a way, try to keep it light. You know, people want to see the reality of life and African-American life and what happens in families, but they also want some levity to it. So I think by using humor, Tyler Perry has been able to open people's eyes and allow people to have the conversation which would otherwise be extremely uncomfortable to have.

The Hall of Famer won more games than anyone in major college football history, and became an icon in State College, Pennsylvania, for his emphasis on academics and integrity as much as on winning; and for the donation of a library and funds for the study of the classics. That legacy, though, was deeply tarnished after allegations of sex abuse against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, and after Paterno's abrupt dismissal after 61 years. Paterno himself said: I should have done more. NEAL CONAN, HOST : How should we remember Joe Paterno? Give us a call: 800-989-8255; email us: talk@npr.org. We'll also read excerpts from several op-eds. We'll begin with this, from Buzz Bissinger on the Daily Beast, where he said: He should not be remembered for - he should be remembered for what he did do: his success as a football coach on the field in which he won 409 games, the most in history; his far more impressive record off the field, in which, according to a recent study, 80 percent of his players graduated within six years; his multimillion-dollar donation to the Penn State library system; his undying love for the school. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But he must be remembered for what he did not do - which wasn't losing to Ohio State or Michigan or Wisconsin, but the willful inaction that by all accounts, helped to aid and abet an alleged sexual predator named Jerry Sandusky. It is how I will remember him most. Maybe it is because the scandal unfolded so soon before his death, or maybe because it was such a failure of responsibility. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can go to a caller. And Glen(ph) is on the line, with us from Panama City in Florida. GLEN : Yes. Thank you. You know, I feel sorry for the people in Pennsylvania because, you know, most of these people, obviously, they don't deserve that tarnish. But sports is all about sportsmanship. You've got to do the right thing, and he did not do the right thing. If he saw a young man being raped back in 2002 and did no more than he did about it - he didn't call the police - they should take that statue and melt it into ingots, and sell it to benefit people that are suffering from those types of abuses. They should take his name off the library too. Get rid of all of it; give it back to his family. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I understand your anger. He, though, did not witness the alleged rape. He was told about it by someone else - who soft-pedaled it, as I understand it. Nevertheless, Paterno himself admitted, I should have done more. GLEN : Yeah. And he didn't, so he doesn't deserve a statue. And I would - if I were a Penn State alumni or student, I would be furious that his statue is on that university; doesn't deserve to be there. Think about the victims, folks. Thank you. Bye. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks for the call, Glen. Here's an email from Lorna(ph) in Palisade, Colorado: As undergraduates, we used to pass Joe Paterno on the sidewalk outside East Halls, the largest housing development in the free world, as he walked to the stadium for practice. We were always aware that he put education of his players above football. For that reason, he was and will remain our hero. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's go next to - this is Rick(ph), and Rick's with us from Ann Arbor. RICK : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead. RICK : I think Coach Paterno is unduly being criticized because - as you said early - he didn't perform the rape; he didn't witness the rape. He reported to people who had the authority to investigate, and he returned to his 16-hour-a-day job. And so he's been - I think he's being vilified. And as I made a point to a friend earlier - is that when I was 13 years old, I was the manager of our high school track team. And during a hazing incident, it got a little creepy. RICK : I've never blamed the coach. I blame the guy who performed the - who decided he wanted to get grabby on me. And that was more - I don't see why Paterno being a third or fourth party should be vilified for this in the way that the previous caller spoke against him so - he didn't do it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : He did not do it. That's - and was not being investigated for any criminal wrongdoing - at least, that's our understanding. RICK : Right. His crime was that he didn't follow up as actively as he should have, and that's his crime. But his crime pales - far pales in comparison to what anybody else ever did so... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, a moral failure, then. RICK : I'm sorry? NEAL CONAN, HOST : A moral failure? RICK : I don't know. I think moral - somebody made the point to me one time was if that was the mother of a child, you know that she would have followed up. And somebody pointed out that you have all these big football coaches with all their bravery on the football field, but they couldn't stand up to a guy who is abusing kids. Now, is that Paterno, or is the assistant coach who reported it, or is anybody else who did the investigating? Is Paterno the one? He is the most visible person. He is the deepest pockets, maybe, for people to go after. RICK : But if it was me, I'd ask the victims.Was Paterno at fault, or was anybody else at fault? Do you - do they hold Paterno at fault? And for everybody else to weigh in on their opinion, I think it's just an opinion that has a little value compared to what the victims would actually - who they would actually blame. \n\n ###",

RICK : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This, from a piece by Jim Litke in the Associated Press. Joe Paterno had barely hung up on the phone when his wife of 50 years picked it up and redialed the number scrawled on the slip of paper. After 61 years, Sue Paterno said to the man who just fired her husband, he deserved better. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll skip down a few paragraphs - yes, he did, Jim Litke continues. And there may be no more fitting postscript for the life and career of a football coach, husband and father who became not just the face but the unyielding, cantankerous soul of a school that over the course of his tenure, was transformed from a cow college into a top-shelf, public research university. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Now, all those people who rushed to judgment about Paterno's role in the Sandusky case will have to find their way out from under the sordid scandal without the longtime coach. Paterno, 85, died yesterday of lung cancer. Those who knew him well believe it was something more akin to a broken heart. His legacy will be forever clouded, in large part because the chance to prove his remorse in the final chapter of his public life was taken by the trustees, and is now gone forever. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For the lion's share of his 85 years, though, Paterno piled one good deed on top of another that had nothing to do with football; things that time can't erase - like the library that sits several blocks from the football stadium and was built, in large part, with his donations back to the school. On balance, all that good should have been enough to earn him one, final opportunity to erase the stain that he called one of the great tragedies of his life. He deserved better. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Michael, and Mike's on the line from Portland. MICHAEL : Hi, there. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted to utilize him as an example of somebody who may have done a lot of good in his life, someone who may have accomplished a lot, can still make an extreme error in judgment that could have potentially caused a tremendous amount of harm. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So a teachable moment. MICHAEL : Yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Michael, thanks very much. MICHAEL : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is from a piece on si.com by Stewart Mandel, remembering Joe Paterno: Though he wouldn't say so openly, Paterno had long feared suffering the same fate as Bear Bryant, the revered Alabama coach who died of a heart attack four weeks after coaching his last game. Eerily, Thursday's the 30th anniversary of Bryant's death. Paterno couldn't imagine life without football. When he was finally confronted with that dreaded reality, it was not of his own volition. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So an 85-year-old man found himself grappling with his unexpected professional demise while also fighting something as unmerciful as lung cancer. Whether you rooted for him or hated him, admired him or detested him, you can surely see the sadness and the self-wrought tragedy of Paterno's final days. One of the perks of becoming an idol is achieving historic immortality, but Paterno was never more human than during the final 11 weeks of his life. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's go next to Paul, Paul with us from Black Mountain in North Carolina. PAUL : Hi, Neal. So you did a good segue because what I - my comment is, basically, this is a tragedy. And the thing about a tragedy, and a tragic figure, is that they're caught up in forces that are far bigger and far beyond their control. And the question about this tragedy is: What is the tragedy of it? And I would like to say that in my opinion, this is an incident that shows that there's something amiss in how we finance, and how we support, higher education in this country - when football and the reputation of a football team, etc., becomes something that could cause all of these lapses of judgment. PAUL : And so it's not really about Joe Paterno. It's about our values being kind of misplaced. And I'm not saying - I mean, I basically think that this could be mitigated a lot if we had a better way of financing public higher education. Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks for the call, Paul. This along the same lines from a piece on espn.com by Howard Bryant, who, of course, also appears Saturday morning sometimes with Scott Simon. (Reading) Despite the urge, Paterno's death should not be used as an opportunity to massage and soften the events that led to his downfall, for it's possible to mourn his passing without rewriting the truths that are known. The truth that his passing should also mark the end of college sports coaching dynasty. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For all the victories and championships, the recruiting coups and runaway revenues, it cannot be understated that his death stands enshrouded in bittersweet contradictions because of the dynasty he was allowed to build. Paterno had too much power, with not nearly enough oversight. He was bigger than the school, and the school towered to - cowered to him. Paterno gave millions back to Penn State, and as his power grew and grew unchecked over four decades, the university lost the ability to control whether he was benevolent or a tyrant. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It was not a power particularly special to Paterno, but to his industry. The entire culture of the coach deserves deconstruction and revision, for the same can be said, in varying degrees, of Bryant and Knight, Bowden and Calhoun, Krzyzewski and Boeheim. Let's go next to - this is John, and John's with us from Aurora in New York. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good. Thanks. JOHN : Great. You know, I listened and - or rather, I read the report about what Paterno said to the reporter, and he said something very interesting. And he said he didn't want to bias the investigation. Now, if you think about how much power that Paterno had and how much there is in our society the abuse of power, at that point in time, if he had followed up, it might have been considered a witch hunt. Or if he, you know, came down - his superiors or the people under him, you know, if he leaned one way or another, he could have been seeing trying to bias the outcome. JOHN : He did, I think, exactly what a position - a man in his position had to do. He reported it to the people who had jurisdiction over the situation, and then he let it go and let the chips where they - you know, they had to fall where they had to fall without him coming on either side of it, because he realized all the things that the reporter just wrote, that he was, in many ways, you know, Penn State. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet some might say... JOHN : Go ahead. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...well, some have said, in fact, that by simply reporting it up to chain of command, he was sending a signal, too, to let's not pay too much attention to this because Joe Paterno, the most powerful man in Happy Valley, did not want to pursue this. JOHN : But he didn't know at the time whether it was accurate or not. If he had - believe me, based on everything, you know, the best way that you can indicate anything about a person is their past behavior. If Joe Paterno had, you know, I believe, felt that there was this horrible person on his campus, why wouldn't he have just fired him? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, he was no longer on the staff at the time. So... JOHN : No, but I mean, yeah, you know, you're banned from campus. If he had that much power, believe me, Joe Paterno could have snapped his fingers and said, out of here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes, he could have. I'm sure he could have. JOHN : No - there's no doubt about that. Now, why would a guy with his background, with his faith, with all these, you know, things dismiss this? There's no past history of that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet he seemed to be remorseful that he did not do enough, that this was not investigated, that the victims were... JOHN : But that's 20-20. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I agree, 20-20. JOHN : That's 20-20. I mean, obviously, the guy came into his office. He said some things. He didn't go in slamming his fist on the desk and say, coach, this is what I'd saw. What are we going to do? He came in and he said, look, I saw this guy in the shower with somebody else. It appeared that he didn't know - he didn't make a definitive statement. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But neither you and or I were at that meeting. But he could have said: What exactly did you see? This is a very serious allegation, a former coach in the shower. JOHN : Now, that's going to be an interesting part of the court case. But you have to, you know, 60 years of being an outstanding guy doesn't fade at a kitchen table at 10 o'clock at, you know, at night. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. John, thanks very much for the call. We're talking about the legacy of Joe Paterno. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. This email from John in Eugene, Oregon: Joe Paterno cared more about winning than anything, including the lives of vulnerable children who looked up to him. He knew Mr. Sandusky should not be allowed to be involved with children or young people, but he allowed the contact and ignored the consequences to pump up the wins column and his ego. He should forever be referred to as child molestation-enabling Coach Joe Paterno. They should help prompt people who were unsure of a coach's or other trusted adults' intentions to look at the situation with open eyes. Paterno's actions sully the great Vince Lombardi line: Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing. Let's see if we can go next to - this is Brian, Brian with us from Ocala, in Florida. BRIAN : Hello, yeah. I believe that - I love your show. I enjoy listening to you. I listen to you every day. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We here at Science Friday are constantly on the lookout for cool, innovative, renewable energy ideas. And when we came across these next two, we knew - I just knew I had to share them with you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Our first one, we go to a dormant volcano in Oregon. It's the site of a renewable energy project that involves hot rocks, millions of gallons of cold water and cutting edge geothermal technology. Susan Petty is the president and chief technology officer for AltaRock Energy, one of the collaborators on this project. She joins us from Seattle. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Welcome to Science Friday. SUSAN PETTY : Hi, Ira. Good to get to talk to you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hope you're weathering the storm out there. SUSAN PETTY : Well, I had to stay home today, because we have 10 inches of snow out here and the road hasn't been plowed yet. But... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, what better way than to share your phone call with us then today? SUSAN PETTY : Absolutely. And we can talk about heat, which is a good thing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, let's talk - so how do - how are you going to use this volcano? Tell us about this. Dormant volcano in Oregon. You're going to use it to generate power. SUSAN PETTY : OK. Well, we were very fortunate. AltaRock Energy is a company that's been focused on advance technology for using geothermal energy since 2007. And we found that the - some folks, Davenport Energy, our partners, had drilled two wells at Newberry Volcano, looking for conventional geothermal resources. And they didn't find it. SUSAN PETTY : What they found, though, was a lot of heat really close to the surface. And so we came to them and said, Look, we've developed this advanced technology that should let us get this heat out, even though you don't have the normal cracks and hot water that would be in place for a conventional geothermal resource. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So instead of - so you made lemonade out of lemons when you got there and decided to try something new. SUSAN PETTY : Something new. And it really is new. I mean, there have been other projects where people have drilled down, gotten into hot rock and made fractures and then circulated cold water down one well and produced it hot out of another well. There're two projects like that - one in Germany and one in France. And they're generating electricity now. SUSAN PETTY : The problem is that it's only economic to do this in some very special places or if you have the kinds of price incentives that they have in Europe to get people to do that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So what you're aiming to do is to do what? You have the rocks \u2013 have the hot rocks there. You will send cold water down, heat it up, bring it back up to the surface? SUSAN PETTY : That's right. And what we are going to do at this particular experiment is we already have a well. That's great. And it's very hot. So what we'll do is we'll put this cold water down. And the combination of the cold and a little bit of extra pressure allows the rock to start to fracture. And then we can extend those fractures out from that first place. SUSAN PETTY : And as they extend out, they will bifurcate and new little fractures will open up. That makes little snapping and popping sounds, which we can use to map where the fractures are going. And we do that from the surface using sensitive seismic instruments. SUSAN PETTY : Then when we finish making one set of fractures, the new thing is that we then pump a suspension of little plastic bits into the crack we've made. That stops that crack going, allows us to let the pressure come up a little bit more in the well. And then the cold water can move out and down, and extend out another set of fractures in the well. SUSAN PETTY : And we can then put the plastic bits in that set of fractures. We can do that again and again until we're happy with what we got. And then when we stop pumping in cold water - this plastic is a biodegradable type of plastic that will then as it heats up break apart into little tiny components of the polymer. That will be completely soluble in water. And we can then produce them out. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### IRA FLATOW, HOST : So you're making sort of a pool or a reservoir of hot water underground? SUSAN PETTY : That's right. A reservoir in little cracks. I don't want you to think of it as an underground lake. It's a reservoir in that it's a bunch of tiny little cracks. And the more tiny cracks we can make, the better we can get at that heat that's in that volcano. IRA FLATOW, HOST : This is not like fracking for natural gas is it? SUSAN PETTY : No. Because in fracking for natural they want a great, big, huge crack, which they then hold open with proppant, with sand. And we don't want that, because that wouldn't get us access to that rock that we want to contact with our cold water to get it to heat up. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How hot does the water get? SUSAN PETTY : Well, we're very lucky. Because this is a volcano, it gets quite hot. So the temperatures in this well are higher than 600 degrees F. They're above 320 C. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. So does the water - that's superheated water then? SUSAN PETTY : Well, yeah. So the water will get that hot, and it will then come out of the production wells at that temperature. And we'll be able to - we have two options then as it comes out of the well. We can either take the steam part - it'll boil - and we then can separate the steam and the water and put the steam through a steam turbine, which is probably what we'll do. SUSAN PETTY : But we have another option. And that is that we can take the full stream of hot water and put it into heat exchangers and boil another fluid. And that will vaporize and that can go through a turbine. SUSAN PETTY : Either way, it's a closed loop. We take all of this water that comes out, pick the heat out of it to make the electricity, and then we put it right back in the ground. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So it's sort of like a boiling water nuclear reactor, but without the nuclear reactor. SUSAN PETTY : Well, you know what? At this place, it's without the nuclear reactor. But everywhere you go on Earth, the deeper you go, the hotter it gets. And that actually is kind of a nuclear reactor, because that heat comes largely from radioactive decay or radioactive isotopes that are in the crust of the Earth. So it's kind of a very diffused and controlled nuclear reactor there under us. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. So when does this all happen? SUSAN PETTY : Well, OK. So the schedule is that we're just now - we've just completed our environmental permitting work. The Bureau of Land Management has released our environmental study for public comment. We have got that public comment period almost done. The BLM will then say go ahead. SUSAN PETTY : And we also have a grant from the Department of Energy to help us do this experiment. So they'll say go ahead. And we have to put in some more sensitive seismic instruments. And that will be happening in the spring. We will then rig up and start the stimulation experiment probably at the end of July, beginning of August. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is this - so you're saying it's technologically feasible, but you have to discover whether it makes economic sense, right? SUSAN PETTY : This is the big part of this, Ira. Right now, we could do this pretty much anywhere. We have the technical capability to generate power from this type of method, anyplace that you would want to try and do it. The problem is it's just not economic. The wells are deep and expensive. And we don't get that much power out of each one, so it wouldn't be justified. SUSAN PETTY : We're hoping that this new method, where we can get a lot more of the hot rock contacted and therefore produce more hot water out of each production well, will make this much more economic. And so then we can move off the flanks of dormant volcanoes, where it's really hot close to the surface and go to places where we would find more normal levels of heat at depth and use this technology to make power a lot of places. That's the goal. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, we wish luck. And we'll be watching to see how this turns out. SUSAN PETTY : Well, that's great. And we'll let you know what happens. \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Susan Petty is president and chief technology officer for AltaRock Energy, one of the collaborators on this project. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We're going to move on now to offshore. The other project I talked about that was really different that we'd kind of like to look into. This is going offshore to deep waters in the Gulf of Maine. And that's where a group called Deep Sea Wind Consortium hopes to one day see 100 floating wind turbines, each as tall as the Washington Monument, harvesting wind energy. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And while we know all about wind turbines, but the difference here - these turbines are going to be in deep water, way out to sea. You won't even be able to see them. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Habib Dagher is director of the Advanced Structures and Composite Center at the University of Maine, which leads the consortium. He joins us from Orono. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Welcome to Science Friday. HABIB DAGHER : Thank you. Pleasure to be with you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Did I describe that correctly? HABIB DAGHER : That's very well done. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're going to have - well, you're not going to start out with 100 of them are you? You're going to just try one or two? HABIB DAGHER : Yes. We we're going to walk before we run on this. And we started, actually, with scale models. These turbines, when they're completed, they'll be about 300 feet to the hub, but five to ten megawatt turbines. The blades would be close to 180 feet long per blade. HABIB DAGHER : So what we've done is we started with smaller specimens, a 150 scale unit, that we put in a wave wind basin. And these were about six feet to the hub, the blades were four feet long. And we put them through, essentially, a variety of designed storms to understand how they perform in hundred year storms. If you've seen the movie, \"The Perfect Storm,\" we actually created many perfect storms in a wave wind facility. And that's where we start and that's where we started them. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you found that they can resist some of these great storms and not be in danger of capsizing or getting wrecked? HABIB DAGHER : That's correct. That's the purpose of the experiments. One reason we ran the experiments is to see how these actually perform, but also to try to understand how to predict how they will perform in a variety of environment. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, what makes Maine or the offshore part of Maine a good place to do this? HABIB DAGHER : Within 50 miles of the Gulf of Maine, of the state of Maine, there's about 150 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity. That's about 150 nuclear power plants worth of wind. And the state of Maine only uses 2.4 gigawatts of electricity at the peak summer period. So we've got quite a bit of resource out there. And the state of Maine also has a maritime history with Bath Iron Works and others who've built ships and so forth, so it made sense for us to harness this resource and then build on an existing industry base. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And this is the first time this idea will be tried in the U.S.? HABIB DAGHER : That's correct. That's the first time it will be tried in the U.S. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Has it been tried elsewhere? \n\n ###",

There's been - there's currently an international race to go after what we call deepwater offshore wind. And the reason is there's so much resources out there and it's close to major cities across the globe. To put things in perspective, there's enough offshore wind capacity around the U.S. coasts, within 50 miles of the U.S. coast, to power the U.S. four times over. And about 75 percent of that is in 100 feet of water or more. So it's a huge resource in the U.S. It's also a huge resource globally. The first operating floating wind turbine in the world was put out in Norway by a company called Statoil about a couple of years ago. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Now Cape Wind in - off, I'm sure as you know, off of Nantucket has been having trouble with the local people, saying this is an eyesore. You won't have that trouble because they're so far offshore? HABIB DAGHER : That's correct. Our turbines - our plan in Maine is to place these turbines between 20 and 50 miles offshore, so you won't see them because of the curvature of the Earth. And we've run some - the University of Maine, through a National Science Foundation-funded program, ran surveys across the Gulf of Maine, across the state of Maine, with two - over 6,000 people, and the support was over 98 percent for the concept. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you would run a cable back to the shoreline? HABIB DAGHER : That's correct. And that technology is thoroughly well known right now. In Europe, they've been building offshore wind farms since 1991, and even in the U.S., we've built another of these undersea cables, if you wish. Yeah, there would be one cable that will come from a farm to a location on that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR, talking with Dr. Habib Dagher, a director of the Advanced Structures and Composites Center at the University of Maine. And you eventually - you there, you eventually - you could be an exporter of electricity, could you not? HABIB DAGHER : Yes, absolutely. The state of Maine has a put a plan together that - to produce close to 5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. That's the equivalent of five nuclear power plants worth of wind, when the wind is blowing, of course, and with an average output of 40 percent of that over the year. That's about two gigawatts. We can't use all two gigawatts in Maine, at least just for electricity. We plan to use it to heat homes, and we plan to use it to also fill up cars, essentially the electrical cars and the hybrid vehicles in the future. And then the rest of it, of course, we could sell on the New England grid. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Tell us your time schedule on it. HABIB DAGHER : We are - we have just finished doing this last year the 150 scale models that we just discussed. At this stage of the game, we're designing a one to six scale unit that's going to be deployed in the spring of 2013, spring of next year, in the water off the Gulf of Maine. Following that, our goal is to put a small farm off the Gulf of Maine and just start constructing that in 2016 and have it operational in 2017. The state of Maine has put out a bid for the farm right now, for this demonstration farm, and the Maine PUC is in the process of selecting a winning bidder for that project. And then following that, between 2017 and 2020, the goal is to expand that to a larger farm in the order of a 500 megawatt farm. So that farm would have, say, 105 megawatt turbines. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And there's no reason why other places up and down the East Coast could not do the same thing. HABIB DAGHER : Absolutely. So there's a lot of opportunities all across the United States and beyond to do this kind of thing. And actually, Japan, as we speak, the Japanese Parliament just two months ago has allocated $250 million to build six floating turbines off Fukushima because of the nuclear disaster in the area. They're looking for alternatives to nuclear energy and they have deep waters off their coast, so they're looking at floating wind turbines as well. The U.K. right now is also looking at doing that. So there's an international race to go to deep water offshore wind technology. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And, you know, what do you say to people who say, well, you know, the wind doesn't blow all the time? HABIB DAGHER : That's correct. We all know that very well. And typically in most places in the U.S., you could integrate wind and you could deal with that. When you - about less than 10 percent penetration of wind on the grid. If you go over 10 percent, you start to have to do some things to back up the wind, so forth. So you can accommodate up to 10 percent penetration in most locations without a lot of trouble. Because what's happening is we already deal with an uncertain grid because the load changes throughout the day and throughout the week and so forth. So we know how to deal with an uncertain load, if you wish. So up to 10 percent in most places, we're OK. And 10 percent of, let's say, in the New England area, the grid is about a 30 gigawatt grid. So getting up to 3 gigawatts in the New England grid would be very doable without a lot of effort. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. But you're taking - you're saying there is potential to go a lot further? HABIB DAGHER : There is. There is potential to go significantly higher than that, of course, with backing up the wind properly. And also, how do you use the wind? If you use the wind, say, to fill up cars, one of the best ways to store renewables is in the electric vehicles. As - if we look down the road 10 or 20 years in the U.S., if we start, say, having a 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 percent penetration of these vehicles, they're like a bunch of batteries. They're not all in one place, but they're a large distributed battery. HABIB DAGHER : And most of us use our cars less than an hour a day. So the other 23 hours they're sitting there, they can be taking that energy and storing it. And, essentially, what we'll be doing is we'll be displacing using fossil fues for the gasoline and using - and replacing that with renewable power. So that could be stored, if you wish, in these vehicles. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. HABIB DAGHER : You can also use it to heat homes with it, and you can store that energy as well. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Sort of distributed storage, instead of (unintelligible). Yeah. HABIB DAGHER : Yeah, yeah. And certainly that's one of the many ways you could use to address some of the - if you wish, the intermittency of the wind. \n\n ###",

Opponents argued that burning off the vast deposits would doom any chance to stop global warming and that the route across Nebraska's Ogallala Aquifer was too risky. Supporters said the pipeline would create thousands of jobs and reduce reliance on Middle East oil. As you can imagine, there's controversy in Canada too. Op-ed columnist Murray Mandryk wrote : It's time for Canadians to move pass talking points and have thoughtful dialogue on better addressing oil policy issues. Well, nobody believes the debate over the XL pipeline is over, so how should we see last week's decision? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. You can also find a link to Murray Mandryk's column there. Op-ed columnist Murray Mandryk wrote : Murray Mandryk is political columnist for the Regina Leader-Post. His op-ed ran in that newspaper on Saturday. And he joins us now from studios at the CBC. Nice to have you on the TALK OF THE NATION today. MURRAY MANDRYK : Well, thank you, sir. Nice meeting you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline project last week, or at least seemed to. You say this is far from being over. MURRAY MANDRYK : Well, I think there's people in your country that will have a far better grasp of the political nuance than maybe I would. But I think there's a lot of people in Canada that anticipate that it will come back in 2013 once things cool down. It's largely seen here from those that can take a breath and get past their own politics to be a strategic political move in relation to your vote coming this fall. Everyone fully anticipates that the pipeline will go ahead because it makes sense on a lot of levels from a Canadian perspective and probably from an American one as well. MURRAY MANDRYK : However, there are any number of controversies related to this and inconsistencies in policy in both countries, not the least of which Canadians, for all our reputation of being nice and reasonable, we sometimes like to have our cake and eat it too. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, fill us in, a little background on the Canadian political argument. Of course this is a policy that's been very popular with the conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper. MURRAY MANDRYK : It is very popular. And much like your country, you really can't talk about a Canadian perspective and have anything that's terribly uniform, sir. In our country, the problem being is that, you know, we are as divided, as I'm sure Americans are, on a lot of issues, up to including this one. And we're also regionally divided because eastern Canada isn't as dependent on oil production as a revenue source. In Canada it's a little bit different perhaps than in the United States because the provinces, equivalent to the state government, obviously has control over the resources - its natural resources. MURRAY MANDRYK : So for provinces like Saskatchewan, where I live, or next door in Alberta, it's a really big deal to produce oil and a really big deal to export it, particularly to the United States, which would be our preferential export. The difficulty being is that, particularly in Alberta, they're running headlong into the environmentalist lobby. It's not just an American environmentalist lobby, but I think our federal Canadian government and perhaps a couple of our provincial Canadian governments want to categorize it that way, as too much influenced by the American left. MURRAY MANDRYK : In reality, though, what is of concern, though, is just being able to get our oil to market. As I say, the preferential market would obviously be the United States, but there's a second pipeline through northern B.C. called the Northern Gateway pipeline that Canadians are proposing - Canadian oil industry is proposing as perhaps an alternative to feed Asian markets - China and such - if this pipeline doesn't go through in terms of the Keystone development. MURRAY MANDRYK : So there is a lot of layers and nuance to this argument that makes it not easy to digest in one whole sitting. You almost have to - you have to take this one in in bite-size pieces. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That pipeline - proposed pipeline to the Pacific Coast, if my grasp of geography is correct, would have to go across the Rocky Mountains, through a lot of wilderness area, and I would assume some areas run by native - operated  by Native American tribes. MURRAY MANDRYK : You're absolutely right. And the first station plan right is an incredibly important issue in Canada, and right now they're in the process of hearings. And it is those hearings that incited the Canadian natural resources minister to start talking about foreign-backed environmental radicals who basically are trying to kibosh is - our Canadian government sees it - this northern pipeline. MURRAY MANDRYK : The fact of the matter is, there's probably many of us who really wonder the very question that you're asking, why on God's green Earth and, you know, quite literally on God's green Earth, do you want to put a pipeline through the Rocky Mountains in general because it's difficult, but pristine wilderness like this through First Nations? The company involved, Enbridge, hasn't exactly had a perfect record on environmental spills, as the people of Wisconsin might attest in 2007. In fact, I think in the last decade, it's had something like 804 spills of 200,000 barrels of oil through its pipelines, et cetera, and its other enterprises. MURRAY MANDRYK : That said, I'm not anti-pipeline. I'm probably like a lot of Americans and certainly a lot of Canadians that obviously see that this is the best way to generally move oil. It certainly beats - it's certainly better than tanking it through - with cars and tanker trucks that are going to possibly have more of an environmental disaster and are more likely to because of the nature. In relative terms, it's probably a reasonably safe way to go about it. But in doing so, we do have to sort out all this environmental differences; our own in this country and certainly with Keystone XL, related to the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska, the sand hills there, and different landownership issues, et cetera. And it's difficult, of course, force it through, because of this situation in America where it has become a bit of a political football. It's now becoming a bit of a political football up here. MURRAY MANDRYK : And as I think you pointed out, the conservative government is pushing it through because they particularly like the idea of this fight for whatever reason in terms of supporting this base, and there's certainly concern about the economic argument. But I don't think enough people are sitting back and taking a look at the Obama administration and understanding that this is a pretty pragmatic government as well. Probably, it's going to come to the conclusion that once the smoke clears, it's in America's best interests, obviously, to have a pipeline through here too. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And one of the reasons people got themselves arrested in front of the White House last fall was the argument that if we start to tap this vast resource of the Alberta oil sands or tar sands - and I guess those have controversial terms, too, whichever one you use - but if we start to tap these vast reserves, if we burn those - that petroleum, the odds of fighting back global warming are over. It's dead. MURRAY MANDRYK : Well, here we run into a bit of difficulty, one of which is the fact that the feeding government isn't - is wholeheartedly - the current Canadian government isn't wholeheartedly supportive of a notion that global warming is man-made, let alone it'll be caused by the tar sands. They embarked kind of very aggressive program called Ethical Oil, and one of the more controversial right-wing authors in this country has even penned a book under that name. And the premise of it basically being is two things, one of which is that the argument that tar sands oil, oil - sands oil isn't as dirty as some claim. MURRAY MANDRYK : And early in my career, I actually work up in the area, in Fort McMurray, and I can attest that, no, it's really not in terms of its environmental impact. Yes, it's problematic, but it is a mining venture. And from that perspective, it's not as damaging as some might think. There's certainly huge issues related to underground water supplies, et cetera, other issues, but there's a really good argument that the whole notion of its environmental damage has been vastly overblown, particularly its impact on global warming. When you can consider all the other things that we do in both our nations and China, like burning coal and such. There's more of a direct impact. \n\n ###",

And I think that's probably fitting into the Stephen Harper Canadian government - the conservative government in Canada - is to what points they want to make in terms of bringing their own agenda forward. So it's, I guess, they say in the movies in terms of some of the protesters, it gets complicated. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Now, let's see. We go to a caller. Edward is on the line, calling us from Maui in Hawaii. EDWARD : Hey. Aloha and happy New Year. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Happy New Year. EDWARD : Say, look, you know, in the last - I don't know how many years it's been since I've been aware of Canadian tar sands, and then in the last year or so since this pipeline has come up. I believe that a lot of what I originally heard of the - in the last year or two was that, as your guest have had said, Canada's interest is marketing their oil. He also speaks of America's best interest. I'm trying to figure out what those are. I know that Canada is improving their pipeline to their coast so they can ship to China. And I know they want to run a long pipeline across our country, and I think the ecological issues can be addressed. But I'm trying to figure out what's in it for us? They want to get access to Gulf Coast ports to ship that oil to other parts of the world. EDWARD : That oil isn't going to end up into our own pipeline. I mean, heck, we're shipping excess fuel off of the continent right now 'cause we have oversupply. What's it - what are America's interests besides what's realistically estimated at around 6,000 jobs for a short period, and then there's the maintenance jobs. I'm assuming there's going to be a tariff per barrel that goes through there. But what exactly, in your guest's opinion, are America's best interest? The threat of not having tankers going along our coast and leaking oil or trainloads through them? Because it really sounds like it's in the best interest of Canada. But what's our interest? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Murray Mandryk, from the Canadian point of view, what's the argument they make when they go to Washington? MURRAY MANDRYK : Oh, certainly. It was the second point that I got a little lost in thought and didn't get to, but it's related to that Ethical Oil question from the Canadian perspective. And simply put this way: Do you want to buy your oil from sometimes unstable Middle Eastern dictatorships? We all know what's happening in the world of the Arab Spring. We all know what's happening in other countries. We know the history with your country related to 9/11 and the difficulties with the Middle East. We know what's going on in Iran and what's going on with Iran right now and what's going on in Iraq. We know the problems related to dealing with Middle Eastern nations. Do you want to deal with Middle Eastern nations or who we like to consider America's best neighbor, which is Canada? MURRAY MANDRYK : Now this is sort of the argument from the Canadian government perspective, not necessarily mine. But I'm actually very sympathetic to that argument because we have the longest unguarded border in the world. We have the best trade relationship in the world. There's no particular reason why us selling oil to Americans can't be beneficial to both of us. However, within that, I think there's a couple of things as Canadians and Americans, but certainly as Canadians, which I'll speak for, that we have to be respectful of - one of which, obviously, is your environmental process. And we can't just be mad and basically say, well, because this isn't in our economic best interest, we have to say we're being picked on or that the American Obama government is somehow doing us an unjust turn. MURRAY MANDRYK : There may be political reasons behind the decisions related to the Obama not - government not approving the permit. But there are certainly political decisions behind the U.S. Congress, dominated by Republicans - at least from our standpoint, there seems to be - of imposing the arbitrary February deadline when they've going through this process for a number of years. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking... MURRAY MANDRYK : It's not like TransCanada pipeline hasn't exactly been in the middle of these hearings forever. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Murray Mandryk, political columnist for the Regina Leader-Post on the Opinion Page this week. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. There was another point mentioned there, and that is this oil would be refined on the Texas Gulf Coast and, a lot of people say, then shipped to export to other countries. It would not go ultimately to the American market. MURRAY MANDRYK : Well, that's quite possible. That - your - I'm venturing out of my area of expertise in relation to this. Generally speaking, in Canada we see the oil being exported for - to U.S. for domestic use and domestic consumption. And certainly, you have a market for it. The tar sands as it's called or the oil sands is - I think they prefer to call it for politically correct reasons of being the product more saleable - is a vast resource that actually has great potential in terms of our fossil fuel needs going forward in the future. And I guess there's an interesting question from the Canadian perspective, is that why would be shipping it from that distance when we could probably refine all of it here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, that's what Gavin(ph) asks in an email from Norman, Oklahoma: It makes sense, on a lot of levels, your guest says. Why does the oil need to be processed 1,700 miles from where it's extracted? MURRAY MANDRYK : Well, you have to understand Canadians sometimes. I think some days I think we just would rather ship raw products and raw resources than refine them ourselves. And it's a century's old frustration for western Canadians who have long been viewed as the hewers of wood and drawers of water, compared with our eastern counterparts. And it's certainly a longstanding frustration, but the fact of the matter is one of the reasons why we do it this way, it's just more economically efficient. MURRAY MANDRYK : If you have the refineries near New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of Texas, and they're existing and they met the environmental approval in those particular jurisdictions, it's more cost efficient than building them up here. Sometimes, we face with the reality of something like Hurricane Katrina that comes along that not only shuts down, basically, your oil production but ours as well. So there are deep considerations here to be made, but this is somewhat the longstanding nature of Canada that's basically been - always deemed itself a bit more of a supplier of raw material than manufacturing. A lot of it has to do with our population base and our inability to do things like this cheaply to go in our climate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Murray Mandryk, thanks very much for your time today.

They tell pollsters, campaigns and reporters they want a candidate who can beat President Trump. NPR's Asma Khalid has been asking Democratic voters to explain what they mean by that. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : Whether it's Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina, Democrats are all seeing some iteration of this. DOUGLAS LEY : I want a win (laughter) pure and simple. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : That's Douglas Ley. He's the majority leader in the New Hampshire State House. Ley says it's still really early, and he wants to hear from all of the candidates first. DOUGLAS LEY : And, you know, quite frankly, if it boils down to, let's say, two or three candidates that I'm happy with but one is perceived by me to be more electable than the others, I'll go with electability. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : That word electability is also something I hear thrown around a lot, so I ask him what exactly it means. DOUGLAS LEY : For me, it means speaking to working people, speaking to good, you know, middle-class people who are getting shafted. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : Ley thinks his party needs to do a better job of appealing to the working class. He's not sure if that means a progressive or a centrist. Frankly, he says, voters just want solutions. And he's not alone here at the big, annual New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner. Chris Muns is chair of the Democratic Party in Hampton, a small town on the New Hampshire seacoast. CHRIS MUNS : I grew up in Michigan. I mean, I think one of the things that Democrats have to do is reconnect with that - you know, that industrial heartland. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : His wife, Melanie, says a candidate's geography might help. CHRIS MUNS : I mean, that's where I think Amy Klobuchar might have a chance because she's from the Midwest. She can appeal to the middle of the country, where other people can't. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : Melanie Muns says she's already seen three or four candidates in person, and a lot of them have similar policies. CHRIS MUNS : Because there are so many similarities, at that point, it'll just sort of be a gut feeling. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : A gut feeling to find someone electable. That word is something Jaime Harrison says he also hears a lot in South Carolina. JAIME HARRISON : People are saying the same thing, but I think it means different things to different people. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : Harrison is an official with the DNC in South Carolina. He says Democrats he talks to are searching for a candidate who will pay attention to the base of the party. JAIME HARRISON : Someone who will go into African-American communities and spend resources to talk to them and mobilize them and get them involved and get them engaged and who will not take the black folks for granted. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : Whether that's a progressive or a moderate is up for debate. KEITH WARING : I'm really looking for a candidate that can bring a centrist message. ASMA KHALID, BYLINE : That's Keith Waring, a city councilor in Charleston. He says if he could choose the ticket, he'd go with former Vice President Joe Biden as president and California senator Kamala Harris as vice president. Waring says Biden has experience, and Harris could re-energize parts of the Obama coalition. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Last week, a cruise ship carrying more than 4,000 people ran aground off the coast of Italy, resulting in the loss of numerous lives, not to mention damage to the ship. It struck a rocky outcropping clearly visible on the chart, tearing a gash in its hull, which leaves us wondering: How in this age of GPS, sonar, other high-tech navigational devices could such a tragedy occur? Did it veer dangerously off-course? What kind of technology does the crew of large cargo and cruise ships depend on? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Joining us to talk about this and answer some of those questions is Max van Norden. He's coordinator of the hydrographic science program in the Department of Marine Sciences at University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MAX VAN NORDEN : Thank you very much, Ira. I'm glad to be on your show. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're welcome. Is this a common occurrence? MAX VAN NORDEN : Not really, not really. I mean, this is - well, this is really a case of gross stupidity. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Why do you say that? MAX VAN NORDEN : Well, because a modern navigational system, which would have been present on a ship like the Costa Concordia, would have definitely warned the crew, the bridge crew and the captain that they were - you know, had to make corrective actions. A modern navigational system, which is called an ECDIS, an electronic chart display and information system, really gives great improvement in navigational safety because, first of all, it gives great improvement in the situational awareness. It automatically plots the position of the ship, as you mentioned, with GPS. MAX VAN NORDEN : It also automatically plots the positions of other ships within its radar range to - and, from that, project, from the course and the speeds, whether there's a problem with, you know, possible collisions with other ships. It also plots what we call AIS targets, automatic information - automatic identification system targets, which every major ship today has to carry an AIS transponder after 9/11 because. And these transponders give a ship's position, its course, its speed, what cargo it carries, where it's coming from, where it's going, what flag it flies, so forth. MAX VAN NORDEN : But from the - from, say, the Concordia's AIS receiver, it could also have plotted all the AIS targets as well. So a active system gives greatly improved situational awareness of the water space the ship is going in and there to prevent collisions with other ships. MAX VAN NORDEN : And then, in addition to that, the systems allow for voyage planning, where the navigator sets out the exact track that they want to follow at each course change based upon the electronic navigational chart. And if the navigator should set out a course or a planned course in this voyage planning that takes it over a hazardous area, the active system will tell him, you can't - this is a bad track. You know, change your voyage plan to a more safer track. So it's also a great improvement in voyage planning. MAX VAN NORDEN : And then the third thing is the route monitoring part. It actually gives you warnings when you exceed the allowances for danger. In the voyage planning, you'll put in things like the ship's characteristics, its turning rate and things like that, its allowable draft. And if it gets too close - and the standoff allowances to navigational hazards, and if it exceeds those allowances, the system will give out warnings, you know? MAX VAN NORDEN : Think of the Exxon Valdez, for instance, in 1989. That accident could have been prevented with a - with an ECDIS system. But they didn't have ECDIS at that time. But if you recall, there was a third mate, an inexperienced third mate on the bridge who failed to make a critical course change. And an ECDIS system would have warned him, say, you've got to make this turn at this time. And - or as the ship was going off towards a navigational hazard, the ECDIS system would have given him a warning, saying, you're getting too close to this navigational hazard. Or a depth sounder, which is interfaced with an ECDIS system, would have told him, you're - the bottom is getting too shallow. You need to make - take corrective actions. So all these are great improvements in navigational safety that these modern electronic chart display information systems provide to the mariner. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And the location of the underwater hazards are also well known, like the rock that it hit. MAX VAN NORDEN : Well, in this case, yes. But you bring up something - there are some pitfalls to these navigational systems, particularly, I think, in my opinion, in fact, the cruise line industry because these displays, these are all very colorful, you know, computer monitors and displays MAX VAN NORDEN : ...navigational systems, particularly, I think, in my opinion, in fact, the cruise line industry, because the - these displays, these are all very colorful, you know, computer monitors and displays that sort in complacency(ph) the fact the - OK, the database for these active systems is the electronic navigational chart, and it looks very colorful as well. But in many cases that information on that chart is based on very old data. NOAA, for instance, is responsible for charting U.S. waters. MAX VAN NORDEN : I've seen the presentation where they say that 50 percent of the data on their charts were collected by hydrographic surveys before 1940, old technology. And so in areas that are well travelled by, say, container ships or tankers, whatever, these well-travelled routes are well charted. But these cruise liners, they like to go off the beaten path and show, you know, pristine areas, picturesque areas to the passengers. So they're going off the beaten path into areas that are not well surveyed. MAX VAN NORDEN : Or maybe they've been surveyed many, many years ago with old technology, even by - perhaps by Captain Cook even. But in any case, these areas in fact may not have ever been surveyed, in some cases of Alaska, where the glaciers have receded and these cruise liners going to these areas and watching these beautiful glacier areas may have never - the waters, however, may have never been surveyed. MAX VAN NORDEN : So for these cruise ships, they're going off the beaten path and putting these half-a-billion-dollar ships at some risk with the passengers, of course, by going into these areas that are not well surveyed. Even though the chart might look very fancy and colorful and - a very colorful display in this modern, integrated bridge, but that underlying data would have been collected, in many cases, with very old technology. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. But the case of last week, this was not that case, was it? \n\n ###",

This is just really a case where - well, from my readings, the Costa Concordia had a modern navigation system, modern (unintelligible) system. It was given a number of warnings that he's getting too close, I'm sure, but I guess in his case, the captain's case, he just turned off the warnings and ignored them. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Would there not be other members of the crew on the bridge there? MAX VAN NORDEN : There would. And I was wondering why the chief mate would not have jumped in and say, Captain, you're doing, you know, you're taking the ship into dangerous waters here. But, you know, that's - I'm just speculating. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. So there's enough electronics on the ship to let you know, at least in that case, to let you know where you are exactly... MAX VAN NORDEN : Exactly. IRA FLATOW, HOST : ...and to let you know exactly what is around you. And it's up to you to decide whether to listen to it or not. MAX VAN NORDEN : Yes.

MAX VAN NORDEN : One that I saw that was really good is gcaptain.com, where they show, using the AIS data, exactly where the ship travelled. And the narrator gives very good explanation what he thought happened. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Gcaptain.com? MAX VAN NORDEN : Yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let me go to the phones to Matt in Alexandria, Virginia. Hi, Matt. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MATT : Oh, hello. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi there. Go ahead. MATT : Yeah. I was curious. I used to be a second mate. And I was wondering if the voyage data recorder info had been recovered. And if so, would it ever be made public? MAX VAN NORDEN : I saw a picture of them recovering the voyage data recorder. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is that like the recorder on an airplane when it goes down? MAX VAN NORDEN : Yes. MATT : Yeah. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So it's been recovered. And that would have the record of where - exactly where it went. \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Matt, does this surprise you as a second mate? MATT : Yeah. Yes. I mean, the ships I've been on have all had one. We never had to do anything with it, I mean it was sort of a passive thing. But we were under the instructions or understanding that if something happened, it would be one of the first things recovered, and the data it records would be used to recreate what happened prior to the incident. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Thanks for calling. 1-800-989-8255. Talking with Max van Norden. So you're saying that there's a lesson here about the future of cruise shipping and knowing where you are and the ancient charts that - and you were not joking that some of these go back to Captain Cook. MAX VAN NORDEN : No, I wasn't. Another example, the QE2 grounded off of Martha's Vineyards a couple of years ago. I think 1992. They went off the beaten path and grounded off on - in an area they hadn't been surveyed since 1939. So, I mean, these things happen. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you say they go off the beaten path because the captain may want to get the passengers a special look at something or get close to a glacier in Alaska? MAX VAN NORDEN : Right. That's part of the deal for these cruise lines, to take you into picturesque, you know, pristine areas of Alaska and other areas and have the, you know, the passengers see some very beautiful scenery. But in a number of cases, these are unsurveyed or very bad or very old surveyed areas. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And the alarms could be going off in the ship, literally off the chart when they do these things. MAX VAN NORDEN : Well, you see, in that case the alarms wouldn't necessarily go off because the ship relies or the active system relies on the known data of the electronic navigational chart. And so if there's nothing to tell or nothing in the data to say that there's, you know, there's a danger, if the rocks haven't been discovered that will ground the ship, if those shoals have not been discovered, there's no - the alarms wouldn't necessarily go off. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But in the normal course of a cruise, we would expect that this is - if you stay on course, this cruise has taken - the captain and his crew have taken this trip a hundred times at least and know exactly where everything is, and they're quite safe. MAX VAN NORDEN : Right. If they follow, you know, the normal shipping lanes or have taken these cruises along that line before, then it should be safe, yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking with Max van Norden, who is coordinator of the Hydrographic Science Program at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. So what is your recommendation here, Dr. Van Norden? MAX VAN NORDEN : Well, of course one recommendation would be to, you know, follow the advice of your ecto(ph)-system and not overrule it. But the other thing is that we need, you know, more hydrographic surveys in those areas where these cruise liners are going. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. And... MAX VAN NORDEN : Modern surveys. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And we need to have captains take less risk. MAX VAN NORDEN : Absolutely. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What is the normal sequence of an investigation that would go on now? MAX VAN NORDEN : Well, I - that's really out of my area. I, you know, I'm sure the Italian version of their coast guard would be following that investigation, and they would have to present the evidence to a maritime court of some type. And generally these things follow some sort of maritime law. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And as far as knowing where you are in the water and what's around you, would not sonar on your own ship tell you that there were these rocks right next door to you, where you're going? \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. 2011 was the ninth warmest year on records, according to a new NASA report, and those records stretch back into the 1880s. And nine of the ten warmest years have happened since the year 2000. In other words, it's hotter than ever in modern history, but no data is enough to convince some climate change deniers about global warming. Lawmakers in several states have already introduced laws to make sure the views of climate skeptics are represented in the classroom. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Louisiana has already passed one. And as the case with teaching evolution, rather than deal with complaints of parents, some teachers are just avoiding teaching climate change altogether saying it's more trouble than it's worth. That's where my next guest comes in. Her group, the National Center for Science Education, has defended evolution teaching for decades and now it's taking on this new challenge to keep good climate science in the classroom and bad science out. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let me introduce her. Eugenie Scott is the executive director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. EUGENIE SCOTT : Thank you very much, Ira. It's great to be back. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How widespread is this phenomena? EUGENIE SCOTT : We have noticed, of course, every year as you and I have discussed, there have been a batch of anti-evolution bills submitted to state legislatures, but over the years, we've noticed that many times these anti-evolution bills also bundle global warming along with evolution as allegedly controversial issues that teachers are supposed to give balance to. And we know what that means, you're supposed to teach standard science and then teach anti-science or anti that particular view. EUGENIE SCOTT : In fact, one was just introduced. We don't even have it up on our website yet. One was just introduced yesterday in Oklahoma that would do this. But we're also hearing reports of school boards and, you know, local school districts discussing regulations or imposing some sort of restrictions on teachers to teach climate change and climate change denial, basically. And that's obviously something that has a chilling effect. EUGENIE SCOTT : But I think the thing that really motivated us to get into this is the stories that we're hearing from individual teachers more and more frequently that they are receiving push back from either students or from parents and of course, the board of directors that pays their salary in the local school district. And we thought that maybe our experience in dealing with these - really they're political issues and not really scientific issues so much - on the local level might help teachers cope with these pressures just as we've attempted to help them over the years cope with pressures against teaching evolution. EUGENIE SCOTT : So, yeah, it's out there, Ira, and it's a problem that we'd like to get ahead of. You know, sometimes I think that the climate change issue, climate change education issue, is sort of where evolution was 25 years ago or 25, 30 years ago. And it took us awhile to gear up to us being, you know, NCSE, but the science community as well. Maybe we can get ahead of this one and it won't be quite as big a problem. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But evolution was based, originally, as a religious point of view. You're saying that this is more a political point of view. EUGENIE SCOTT : That's correct. The commonality is that with the anti-evolution problem that we have been dealing with, yes, you're right, the ideology that motivates it is religious ideology. There's some religious ideology that motivates the anti-global warming group, but it's not really predominant. I mean, there's, you know, God's providence would never let anything bad happen to the Earth is out there, but that's not really what's motivating and paying for the surge of anti-global warming and climate change that we've seen recently. EUGENIE SCOTT : It's more a political ideology and/or an economic ideology. it's the idea that if the planet's getting warming - if the plant is truly getting warmer, then we're going to have to do something about this and this is going to require us to make compromises, perhaps in our standard of living. I might lose my job if I'm in a business that's - or an occupation that has to do with energy production based on carbon, you know, coal, oil, gas, et cetera. EUGENIE SCOTT : And people really have sincere fears about what's going to happen and clearly, the easiest thing to do is just attack the science. Well, the science is invalid. It's not really getting warmer. This is just an effort by liberals to increase big government. You hear that kind of argument out there as well. And so, you know, yes, the science is necessary. Yes, we will have to deal with the claim it's just sun spots or it's just the sun or it's just normal cyclical kinds of things. It's the volcanoes, not human putting CO2 in the air. We're going to deal with that. EUGENIE SCOTT : But fundamentally, we're going to have to deal with these underlying issues, just like with evolution you have to deal with the underlying religious issue and try to assuage some of those concerns. Because, you know, you can't solve this problem by just piling more science on it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And science teachers are avoiding the whole thing altogether. EUGENIE SCOTT : We have reason to believe, but it's only anecdotal. There hasn't been a really good survey, a good reliable, you know, standard survey of research... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. EUGENIE SCOTT : ...type of survey of teachers as to what they know about climate change, climate science, and what they're actually teaching about it. But we have reason to believe anecdotally that many teachers are saying, whoa, this is another controversial issue. It's too much work to - you know, I don't want to put up with the crap. I'm just not going to teach it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We have a lot of people who email us or blog us and say, if I want to answer climate change skeptics, where do I get information? What kind of hard data can I tell them why I'm convinced of it? EUGENIE SCOTT : I think a website that I've found very useful and I recommend to people and will certainly link to it from the resources on NCSE's website is climatescience dot - excuse me, skepticalscience.com. It's a very useful site. It's written by scientists and knowledgeable people, engineers and the rest and they have very clear explanations with links, you know, documented scientific research supporting their views for the top 100 or so climate change denialist arguments. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. IRA FLATOW, HOST : An American cancer patient became the second person in the world to receive a synthetic windpipe transplant. Surgeons in Sweden replaced a patient's cancerous windpipe with one that was grown in the laboratory. It was made from plastic nanofibers and seeded with the patient's stem cells. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But just how is this artificial organ turned into a functioning airway? And how can this experimental procedure be used on other organs, perhaps lungs, even the heart in the future? IRA FLATOW, HOST : My next guest, Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, was the lead surgeon for both synthetic windpipe transplants. Dr. Macchiarini is the director of the Advanced Center for Translational Regenerative Medicine at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Welcome to Science Friday. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DR. PAOLO MACCHIARINI: Thank you so much. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thank you for joining us. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's start at the beginning. How was the scaffold for the synthetic trachea built? MACCHIARINI : Well, basically, by the same fibers that everybody of us has, nanofibers; very, very small fibers that are composed and native to the human trachea. So when we wanted to transplant this organ, we thought what is best. And the best would be to just replicate what human nature has done. And this is the reason why we use these very thin fibers. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And then you seeded the fibers, the mold, so to speak, the plastic, with the patient's own stem cells. MACCHIARINI : Exactly. Because these first steps, the generation of the scaffold, was entirely made in the laboratory. But without the cells, the scaffold could not be implanted, because the trachea is the only organ which is in contact with the external environment. So if you put a prosthesis(ph) or synthetic material (unintelligible) become infected. And you can have different lethal problems. By reseeded the scaffold with a patient's own stem cells, we were making living plastic tissue. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Did the stem cells then start to grow as trachea cells? MACCHIARINI : Well, the first step is to produce a nano(ph)  composite. Then the second step is to take the stem cells of the patient. The third step is to put the two together using a so-called bioreactor, which is a shoebox where you put this (unintelligible) cells and the scaffold. And the cells are attracted by this scaffold, because it is biomaterial and permits attachment of the cells. And the cells are not only attaching, but then starts to proliferate, are living. So that they feel like they would be in a physiological (technical difficulties). MACCHIARINI : Once you have done this, you implant it, implant this in the human body and you give bioactive (unintelligible) that differentiate the stem cells into the (unintelligible) of the trachea. And this happens usually within 14 days after the transplantation. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so that the stem cells basically grow and become part of the trachea? MACCHIARINI : Well, rather than growing, they differentiate into the given specific cells. And to avoid infection (unintelligible) the graft. Yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so by the time you transplant it back into the patient, you have the plastic structure and you have tracheal cells that you're putting back into the patient? MACCHIARINI : Well, we have the nano composite. We have cells. But these are not tracheal cells, because in such a short time you cannot differentiate a cell. You just can have cells that are living. And once they are implanted in the human body, we use the human body as a so-called own bioreactor and we boost the regeneration. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so how long would it take for those cells to regenerate once they're back in the human? MACCHIARINI : Well, after one week of the transplantation, we did an endoscopy. That means an evaluation of the graft. And by taking the cells out, we were finding evidence that the cells of the (technical difficulties)  inside it were already there. So in short of seven days you can have differentiated cells starting from not differentiated cells. \n\n ###",

MACCHIARINI : Well, we did - before the last patient came home, we did again an endoscopy. And it was lined with the cells. And today we just proved, with the pathologist, that cells were all there. So probably this depends (technical difficulties) three dimensional measures of the trachea. Because if it a - it's a very long - it is a trachea with bifurcation so that many factors play a role. But usually within two to three weeks, if you tell the body to boost, to accelerate regeneration, you can get the complete differentiated trachea. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Two to three weeks you can make the whole trachea. MACCHIARINI : Well, using the human body as a bioreactor, yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So I imagine you could try to do this with other organs in the body, other things. MACCHIARINI : Well, we are starting to learn what happens with this still experimental therapy. So I'm not so pessimistic to try to do the same with other tissues or organs. And since I'm a thoracic surgeon, I deal with organs of the chest. So I would think of the esophagus at the chest wall, at the liver \u2013 at the lung, and eventually at the heart. Yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And how are the patients doing? MACCHIARINI : Well, probably there was a huge media coverage when he came back in the United States. And he's doing very well. He was seen yesterday by his referring physician in Baltimore. And as far as I know he's doing fine. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Can you reconstruct blood vessels this way? MACCHIARINI : Well, actually, the Yale University has started to - a clinical trial approved by the FDA using tissue (unintelligible)  in children. So the answer would be yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And just to understand more completely, this is a - the trachea is - it has a microfiber backbone to it, on top of which you have permeated with stem cells. And the stem cells have been coaxed into becoming tracheal cells? MACCHIARINI : Exactly. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Exactly. And then they have now totally covered and taken over on top of this structure of plastic? They have now become sort of a living organism? MACCHIARINI : Yes, sir. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. And you did this all - it all happened within just a matter of a few weeks? MACCHIARINI : Well, usually - again, depending on the degree of difficulty of the three dimensional aspect of the tissue, you can produce a trachea, for instance, just the tube, in two days. And a bifurcated trachea in 10 days. So now - then you need two days for getting the cells, reseeding the grafts, or in  two weeks you have an entire trachea. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And perhaps you might extend your work further, because you deal in this and possibly into the lungs. MACCHIARINI : Well, ideally, yes. But to me my dream would be another one. It would be rather than replacing the lung or replacing the heart, you use cell therapy to treat these organs before they ultimately do not work anymore. so rather than doing a transplantation, just when we have the first signs of insufficiency, whether to treat these organs with the patient's stem cells, probably targeting the defect that they have, so prolonging and extending their life. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So if you have untreatable tumors, for example, within the patient, you might be able to instead of putting a new part in put the stem cells in and they would grow to replace that? MACCHIARINI : Well, I don't think that this is so easy. We first need to be very cautious to identify so-called cancer stem cells, because within the cancer you have cells that do proliferate forever and have many of the aspects of undifferentiated and ever proliferating stem cells. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. Russia's Phobos-Grunt spacecraft splashed, crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Sunday. It was a failed mission. It was meant to travel to the Martian moon Phobos and bring back a soil sample, but it got stuck in Earth orbit instead. And they were - never made it out of there. But in lieu of shooting off another expensive sample return mission to Mars, there is a cheaper way, just wait for those Mars rocks to come to us. IRA FLATOW, HOST : It happens once about every 50 years, and we got lucky last July when a meteor shower spits some Martian samples, right here down to Earth. They fell way out on the Moroccan desert, but the samples have come back. Since then, scientists, including my next guest, have been snatching up those meteorites from meteorite dealers. Yeah, they exist. What do you do once you get your hands on them? Can you even touch one without contaminating it? Is there any hope those chunks might contain some trace of organic compounds or even traces of past or present life? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Joining me now to talk about it is Chris Herd. He's associate professor and meteorite expert at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. He joins us by phone. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Herd. CHRIS HERD : Thanks very much. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You are actually in actual possession of one of these chunks? CHRIS HERD : Yes, yes. I arranged to purchase a specimen of this amazing meteorite for the University of Alberta Meteorite Collection. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How do you buy one of these? CHRIS HERD : Well, you talk to a meteorite dealer, and you work out a good value, a good rate. And then, yeah, you come up with the money. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm picturing the scene from \"Casablanca\" and that marketplace where people were selling all kinds of stuff. Is there an underground meteorite market with folks who come in and out of the desert picking the stuff up? CHRIS HERD : Well, in actual fact, in morocco there's a whole economy set up with people picking up meteorites from the desert. They know what they look like, and they bring them into the markets and sell them there. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What do they look like? What does the one that you have looked like? CHRIS HERD : Well, it's kind of unusual as meteorites go, because it is a rarer type being from Mars. But it has a black what's called a fusion crust, the outer crust that formed as it came screaming through the atmosphere that sort of burnt look to it. And in - on one side, it's broken, and you can see a bit of the interior. The interior is sort of a greenish-gray color. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So sort of glass-encrusted in its own little delivery vehicle? CHRIS HERD : Yeah. That's right. The outside heats up enough to actually melt the rock, and then, that forms a glass as it cools off after it comes into the atmosphere. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And how do you analyze it without contaminating it? You know, because I'm figuring you're handling it, but you're saying since it's sort of covered in glass, it's - the inside is, sort of, kept pristine from the way it was. CHRIS HERD : Yeah. Well, that's something that we want to - we definitely want to test. How do you keep it from getting contaminated? That's probably one of the best questions, because this is really an incredible opportunity - being such a recent delivery, such a recent fall - that we want to try to do everything that we can to keep it from getting contaminated, including with organic molecules. And we have those on our fingers, all, you know, and it's just the way we are. We have things like cholesterol and squalene, weird compound - sounding compounds like that that actually are in our finger crease. CHRIS HERD : And so one of the things that I did after we've received this - the sample was to actually just give a little bit of a rinse on the outside with a solvent that we're going to - and we're going to analyze that, hopefully, later this week or next week and see what we find. It's actually kind of a way of detecting whether anybody has touched it before it got sent to me. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And then, how do you crack it open and look inside? CHRIS HERD : Well, then, we'll - we're going do everything we can before. There's a lot of sort of nondestructive, as we call it, tests that we can do first. But then once we - once we're ready, we'll cut it open. We'll use a very thin blade saw, and we'll cut it open. And we'll look inside, and we'll make polished mounts that we can do various types of analysis on with microscopes and just try to get as much as we can - much information as we can out of it.

All we can say is that, based on the original work that was done by my colleagues, Tony Irving and Scott Kuehner at University of Washington in Seattle, we know that they - it has a texture that is the minerals that are - the way they're inter-grown is very similar to other types of Martian meteorites that we've looked at before. But we don't know anything about the age yet. Having said that, those other meteorites that this is similar to, are in the sort of 200- to 500-million-year-old range. That's geologically fairly young, and that's not from a time period that that where we think there was a lot of water around on Mars, but you never know. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. You know, there was that famous meteorite from Mars that's supposedly had signs of ancient life on it that created a lot of excitement, and then went away very quickly. CHRIS HERD : That's right. And that one was - that one is of around four billion years old. So that dates, really, from way back in Mars' history. As I say, we don't really know, because we only just started working on this, how old this particular meteorite is. But the potential is there because it's a fresh meteorite fall, you know, because it's been kept pretty clean, as far as we know, that once we get into the inside of it, we may be able to find - you know, what we find inside is more likely to be from Mars than from the Earth. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to the phones. Dale in Denver. Hi, Dale. DALE : Yes. I'd just like to make a comment that - I mean, ever since I first heard of these meteorites that supposedly come from Mars they found on Earth, I've been incredibly skeptical. You know, beyond an asteroid, you know, a large meteorite slamming into Mars and knocking debris up, and then having that stuff make it all the way to Earth are incredibly astronomical. Until we can actually get something from Mars and compare it to these meteorites, you know, I think it's a little farfetched making the claim that we're actually examining bits of Mars. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Thank... DALE : We have no proof of that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, let me get a reaction, Dale. Thanks for that comment. CHRIS HERD : Sure. I can definitely address that. And there was a really seminal series of studies that were done in the early 1980s on a particular Martian meteorite - a particular meteorite that belonged to this group that was found in the Antarctic. Prior to that - prior to the mid-1970s, early '80s, these meteorites were kind of lumped into a group on their own. We didn't really know where they came from. We just knew that they looked different front other meteorites. CHRIS HERD : In the - in 1976, we had the Viking landers, and the Viking landers had instruments onboard that could measure the composition of the Martian atmosphere, and they did that quite well. And in the early 1980s, this one meteorite was investigated and found to contain trapped gas inside of it. When that gas was analyzed, it was shown to be a match to what the Viking landers found in the Martian atmosphere. And further to that, it's been shown that the Martian atmosphere composition is unique in the solar system. There's no other planet or object or moon that has quite the same composition of atmosphere. So finding this trapped gas in the meteorite is a fingerprint that tells us that it comes from Mars. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What can you learn from this meteorite or other meteorites that land in Morocco or other places apart from what you can learn from the Antarctic ones that have already been discovered for many years? CHRIS HERD : Well, each one, they're all quite similar in some ways. They're all igneous rocks - that is rocks that started their lives as a magma somewhere in the interior of Mars and came up and erupted near the surface. But they all have slight differences to them, and there's - some of them are quite subtle. Some of them are even, you know, more subtle than what you see just by slicing it open and looking at the texture. And so these are the types of advance studies that we do to try to figure out what this new meteorite can tell us that we haven't found in other ones. Every single one tells us another piece of the puzzle of Mars geology as a whole. CHRIS HERD : One of the things that we can do is to actually peer back through the thing - the magma crystallizing into this rock. We can peer back and say something about the magma itself and the interior of Mars, that part of Mars that it came from. So in some ways, we can almost probe right into the inside of Mars through these kinds of studies. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now, Dale is very - from Colorado is very skeptical about - I mean, how could a meteorite, a piece of Mars, get here? CHRIS HERD : Well, he was right that, you know, that the ideas that some large objects, some other meteorite slammed into Mars and launched rocks off the surface. Mars is a smaller planet than the Earth. It has lower gravity, about one-third the gravity of the Earth. And it has been shown through a modeling now that you can actually launch rocks off the surface of Mars. You don't even need a very large object hitting Mars in order to do it. The object - the minimum that you need is something like - something that would hit Mars and make a crater about three kilometers across, which, you know, sounds kind of large, but there's lots of craters that size or larger on Mars. You can get a rock sitting near the surface, accelerate it, you know, fast enough to leave Mars' gravity. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And maybe it could be floating around in the solar system for thousands of years until... CHRIS HERD : Thousands, or millions, at least. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Or millions. So something happens to nudge it in this direction, or it gets here? CHRIS HERD : Or just - yeah. It just happens across our orbit. And, in fact, you know, the - I mean, the point about it - this is that because we keep getting these - this is now the fifth fall of a Martian meteorite, plus we found a whole bunch of other ones, some other - 50-some other meteorites all over the world that have fallen in, you know, prehistoric times. We know that there's debris out there, Martian debris sort of floating around in the solar system, and it keeps landing on us. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So there could be a lot more stuff out there in the desert that... \n\n ###",

CHRIS HERD : There's always a competition. I'm sure there are groups out there looking right now. You know, the economy that exists around these things really drives people to, of course, go and look for more all the time. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What did you pay for this, if I might ask?

Ever find yourself going through day stuck in autopilot mode, waking up at 7:15, wolfing down your usual hot cereal, really, without really tasting it, while you read the paper, your emails, your Facebook feed. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Then it's off to work, sitting in traffic on the bus or train, consumed by thoughts of that electric bill - oh, I forgot to pay that; the birthday call you have to make; that confrontation you want to avoid at work today; or what you're cooking for dinner tonight. Any of this sound familiar? Would you like, instead, to turn off those stressful thoughts of the day and just concentrate on what's going on around you right now? Relax, enjoy the moment and worry about that stuff later. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's what my next guest advises, what he calls mindfulness based cognitive therapy, or mindfulness meditation, a practice, he says, can sometimes be as effective as drugs and staving off recurring bouts of depression. What's the science behind meditation therapy and what are the connections between body and brain? Mark Williams is here to explain and he's actually going to guide us through a mini meditation session. We wouldn't want you to do this while you're driving so a little bit later we're going to do a little meditation and maybe you'll pull off the road or listen to it later on the podcast. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mark Williams is the author of \"Mindfulness: An Eight-week Plan For Finding Peace in a Frantic World.\" He's also professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford in England. He joins us from BBC Radio (unintelligible) in South Hampton, England. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MARK WILLIAMS : Hi. Thank you very much indeed. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Could you explain \u2013 is there a nutshell you can explain what mindfulness is? MARK WILLIAMS : Well, mindfulness is a form of awareness, really, so we're all aware sometimes that just as you're wonderful description of getting up in the morning and as you were driving to work with all these things going through your head, we also know that sometimes we can naturally switch that off sometimes if we take the time to take a walk with a youngster, you know, three or four-year-old, and they're going very slowly along the road and they're looking at things. MARK WILLIAMS : And sometimes you just have this capacity to slow down at their pace to see what they're seeing as if through their eyes and to see little tiny details of life as if for the first time. So we know rushing around, but we also know how to slow down sometimes. It's just that slowing down is actually very difficult to do. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, especially in this age. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. You can call us to talk about mindfulness. Maybe you practice it yourself. You can go to our Twitter, tweet us at scifri. Is this an especially challenging time with all the distractions from our cell phones and tablets and things like that? MARK WILLIAMS : There's no doubt that we have always lots of new challenges. Now, whether cell phones and emails and stuff, which, of course, most of us find get us down from time to time, whether that's something which is a passing phase in terms of perhaps the new generation coming up will learn how to cope with that better than we who've been around a while without it and then find it very overwhelming. MARK WILLIAMS : But certainly the 24 hour, seven days a week connectivity, as my colleague John (unintelligible) UMass Medical Center has pointed out, that sense of connectivity means that we have to take special measures to know how to slow down and how to take a brain break, if you like. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. We're going to talk about those special methods for slowing down and taking a brain break. We're going to try and take one right here on SCIENCE FRIDAY, after the break when we come back and have Mark Williams give us a little demonstration of how to practice mindfulness. Our number is 1-800 - this is something, Michael - 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Also, you can tweet us at scifri, @S-C-I-F-R-I, and we'll try a little mindfulness during the break. Stay with us. We'll be right back. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Mark Williams, author of \"Mindfulness: An Eight-week Plan For Finding Peace in a Frantic World.\" Our number is 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us or on Facebook, go to our Facebook site at scifri and tell us, do you meditate, why you do it, what do you get out of it. You can tweet us or leave us a little note there in our SCIENCE FRIDAY Facebook page. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mark, who is this book for? Is it for people who suffer bouts of depression? Is it for people who - is it for everyone? Is it to teach you how to focus on what you want to focus on instead of all those other things? MARK WILLIAMS : Absolutely. If you start with that last question, most of us find that our attention is often hijacked by our current concerns so our attention just wanders all over the place and it's very difficult to focus. So one of the first things you learn in mindfulness meditation is how to just settle the mind, how to focus, not to clear the mind. So it's not the idea that you try to switch off all these thoughts going through, but that you see them passing through the mind like clouds in the sky. MARK WILLIAMS : And that already gives you a greater sense of balance and control in your life. And the reason why it's relevant for everybody and not just people who get depressed is because both getting caught up in the constant spin of rushing around in a frantic world needs some addressing for many, many of us, most of us indeed. But also, we find that exactly the same strategies, the same skills we find in our research actually reduces the risk of depression. MARK WILLIAMS : So those how would get depressed in life many times, especially those with three or more previous depressions, it halves the risk of depression coming back. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So this is actually measurable, the effects. MARK WILLIAMS : Indeed, indeed. So there would be now six trials around the world starting off with the trial at (unintelligible) in Toronto and (unintelligible) in Cambridge and I did now 10 years ago. And that was the first trial to establish that eight weeks of this training could reduce depression. And we measured it both with questionnaires, but also with very careful interviews based on the American Psychiatric Association's interview to diagnose depression. And the interviewers were blind. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### MARK WILLIAMS : They didn't know whether people had had the meditation or not, so they couldn't, as it were, make up the results to try to make the results better. And they found this really striking reduction in the risk of future depression. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mark, can you give us a little taste of the sort of meditation you teach in the book, a little session here? MARK WILLIAMS : Yeah. So here's a two or three minute meditation that people can try out.  As you quite rightly said, it's not wise to do it if you're in your car and you're doing lots of things that need your full attention. But if you can, you can become aware of your posture and just if you're in a sitting position, you might want to just sit up straight so you've got a straight spine. But not stiff, not sort of like a sergeant major. MARK WILLIAMS : Just with the back straight, the head balanced, the shoulders can be quite relaxed and dropped. And even this sense of changing your posture already signals your intentions to step out of autopilot. And then, there are three steps now that people can try for themselves. The first is just to notice what's going on in mind and body right now. So in the silence that comes up, just notice any thoughts that are around, any feelings or emotions there may be, any body sensations that are around. MARK WILLIAMS : Notice any tendency we have to want to change what we discover and seeing if it's possible to simply allow it to be just as it is, just as it already is. And then, moving to step two of this short meditation, to gather your attention, to let all that fade into the background, gather the attention and place it lightly on the breath. So just noticing the sensations of the breath moving in and out of the body, and it may be convenient just to focus on the sensations down in the abdomen. MARK WILLIAMS : You can put your hand on the abdomen, if you like, and just notice the rising of the in breath and the falling away of the out breath. And just paying attention as best you can to that sensation of breathing in and breathing out. Not trying to control the breath in any way, simply allowing the breath to breathe you. And if the mind wanders at all, just notice where it went, and very gently escort it back to the breath, the sensations of in or out breath. MARK WILLIAMS : And now, taking step three of this short meditation and expanding attention to the body as a whole, sitting here. So simply noticing the whole body, all the sensations in the body from the surface of the skin and right deep inside as if the whole body was breathing now and allowing the sensations in the body to be just as you find them. A sense of coming home to the body. And then, when you're ready, beginning to move fingers and toes, opening your eyes, if they've been closed, and taking in wherever you are, all of your surroundings, and allowing thee meditation to pass and coming back to this moment. MARK WILLIAMS : So that's it, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's nice. Is this something that you have distilled from other meditation techniques or something you've... MARK WILLIAMS : Yeah. I mean, right in the beginning of our research in the beginning of the 1990s, we were very, very helped by a tremendous breakthrough that had been made by John Cabbot Zen(ph) and his colleagues at the UMass medical center in Wooster. And he developed mindfulness based stress reduction for chronic pain and people whose illness was caused by stress or who were stressed by their illness. And he developed an eight-week program in which he'd taken some of the essence of these centuries old - I like to call them spiritual exercises. MARK WILLIAMS : They exist in all religions and they exist in secular context as well. And he'd put them in the heart of a general hospital for chronic pain and he generously allowed us to use that as a format for applying mindfulness to our problem that we had as psychologists, which was the gradual realization that had come to the fore at the last part of the 20th century that depression was getting more and more common and recurrence was very, very in the minds of clinicians, because people were getting depressed earlier in life so they're having a whole lifetime where they were at risk of a new episode of depression. MARK WILLIAMS : So the emphasis changed from treating depression to preventing depression. And so we distilled from John Cabbot(ph) in using many of the meditations he used. And the three minute breathing space, which is what we've just been through, was a distillation even further down so that people could have a mediation which was very portable, that they could take around and do it any time of day whenever they felt they needed to gather themselves. MARK WILLIAMS : And you notice the very first step of the breathing space is not actually going to the breath at all, but just checking in with what's the weather pattern like in your mind and body, a sense of - what is this? What's arising from me right now? And that itself is a huge gesture of openness to yourself, of friendliness towards yourself, and for people who are depressed or frantic all the time, we're not very much friends with ourselves. You know, we tend to beat ourselves up all the time. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones and see some questions we've gotten. Robin in Brumfield, Colorado. Hi, Robin. ROBIN : Hi. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi, there. MARK WILLIAMS : Hi, Robin. ROBIN : Am I on the air? IRA FLATOW, HOST : You certainly are. I know you probably put yourself very much at ease at that mindful session we just had. ROBIN : Well, I can tell you firsthand that mindfulness works and it absolutely changed my life. I am so excited that you're running this program. Thank you for running this program to make people more aware of mindfulness. I am in the process through my nonprofit organization to launch a program for children, teaching children mindfulness in the schools. And it's such an amazing thing for kids. And I'm doing all this research to that, how it's helping children with impulse control and more focused and assured in their ability to just help them to redirect their thoughts and be more clear. \n\n ###",

MARK WILLIAMS : Absolutely. ROBIN : So it's really exciting. MARK WILLIAMS : Yeah. Thanks, Robin. Absolutely. We've got some schools program over in the United Kingdom as well and it's extraordinary how children get it so quickly. Do you find that? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Oh, we lost her. I think she... MARK WILLIAMS : Okay. IRA FLATOW, HOST : ...she... MARK WILLIAMS : She's gone. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But you have experience with kids and... MARK WILLIAMS : Yeah. We mostly, in our Oxford mindfulness center deal with adults, 18 to - towards older age adults, but we support various other groups that are looking at children, and we also do, even earlier than that, for mindfulness-based childbirth and parenting to prepare for a new baby based on the Californian work going on by Nancy Bardacke, a nurse midwife in California who's developed childbirth and parenting programs with Mindfulness. MARK WILLIAMS : But the school's work that Robin has alluded to: Goldie Hawn's doing a lot of work with her Mind Up program in the States. That's also come into the U.K. And I mean, the whole idea of brain breaks, for example, is from the Goldie Hawn Mind Up program, where she just - is very much a fact about the way in which kids are able to take these short breaks, and it really helps them focus their attention. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Talking with Mark Williams, author of \"Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan For Finding Peace In A Frantic World.\" Can people get frustrated trying to do this correctly during your instructions? MARK WILLIAMS : Oh, absolutely. And in fact, the frustration is a real good opportunity during meditation to notice all the adverse sort of little reactions that happened, like I noticed you say to doing it correctly. And there's a great emphasis in our world - isn't there - on making sure you do things well. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Exactly. MARK WILLIAMS : And, you know, we don't ever heed that wise advice that says if a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing badly. And I think in one sense, with meditation, the sense of having the intention to be - to give yourself a little break, to be with yourself as you are, that's already enormous. It's an enormous act of generosity towards yourself. And then, you can watch all these thoughts coming up like, am I doing it correctly, or maybe I've done it wrong. I'm not trying hard enough. MARK WILLIAMS : Oh, I went to sleep. Oh, my mind wandered. And that's exactly the stuff of meditation. Meditation is not sitting blissfully at the top of the mountain with a mind clear. It's actually noticing all the stuff that we don't normally notice going through our mind, and then learning to relate differently to all of the stuff. We notice that sense of failure. We notice the sense of frustration, and we notice the sense of I must always get things right or it means I'm a bad person. MARK WILLIAMS : We notice that and then gradually, sort of, step back a little, not in an avoidant way, but see it like standing behind the waterfall, seeing its force but not getting dragged down by it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : In your book, \"Mindfulness,\" one of the things you recommend is being more spontaneous. Tell us about that. MARK WILLIAMS : Well, one of the things we ask people to do, week by week, is not just to meditate, but do things in their daily life which just, sort of, shake up the habits a bit. So, for example, we suggest just sitting in a different sort of different chair at meetings, occasionally and - or at home, just to get that different perspective. Or maybe doing, sort of, going to a movie theater without planning - with a friend - perhaps without planning beforehand what you're going to see. So you just turn up at seven in the evening or eight in the evening, and you just watch what's there, just choose when you get there. MARK WILLIAMS : Now, most movie theaters often have a big choice, so it's not a disaster to do that. But there is a, sort of, sense of spontaneity, a sense of reclaiming the life that you've probably, you know, lost when you moved out - teenager or early 20s. Many of us are very cautious. We want to plan our times to the last second, and that means not going to see anything that we didn't plan beforehand and know what it was. So that sense of just shaking up and being a little more spontaneous can help reclaim your life a bit more. \n\n ###",

You have a personal relationship, and I believe Vice President Pence does, with the family of Otto Warmbier. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I do. DAVID NAKAMURA : I'm wondering... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Otto Warmbier was the American college student detained by North Korea in 2016 and convicted of trying to steal a propaganda poster. Sometime while in detention, he fell into a coma. He never regained consciousness. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : It's not known for certain what happened to Warmbier while he was imprisoned. The North Koreans say that Warmbier contracted botulism. The Warmbier family says he was tortured. He was released to the U.S. in June of 2017, and he died a week later. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Which brings us back to the press conference today - Washington Post reporter David Nakamura asked Trump if he had spoken to Kim Jong Un about what happened. DAVID NAKAMURA : Have you, in Singapore or here, confronted Kim Jong Un about Otto Warmbier's death... PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I have. DAVID NAKAMURA : ...Asked him to take responsibility? And what did he say to you? And why do you call him your friend? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I have. And I have talked about it, and I really don't think it was in his interest at all. I know the Warmbier family very well. I think they're an incredible family. What happened is... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : President Trump said whatever happened to Warmbier was, quote, \"horrible,\" but concluded Kim Jong Un was not responsible. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I really don't believe that he was - he - I don't believe he knew about it. DAVID NAKAMURA : Did he say - did he tell you that he did not - did Kim Jong Un tell you... PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : He felt badly about it. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : And Trump added, he believed it when Kim said he didn't know anything about it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You know, you got a lot of people - big country, lot of people. And in those prisons and those camps, you have a lot of people. And some really bad things happened to Otto - some really, really bad things. DAVID NAKAMURA : Why are you...

How did he play that today, and how did the lawmakers questioning him play that? RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Well, this really was the big ole elephant in the room. Cohen has pleaded guilty to several federal crimes, including tax evasion, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. He is going to federal prison, as you said.

He acknowledged that Cohen lied in the past, but he said that it was critical to hear from him today so that lawmakers and the American public can make their own assessment of what he has to say. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Republicans came at this from the other side. The top Republican on the committee, Jim Jordan, ripped into Cohen. This is a tactic that was repeated by almost every Republican lawmaker. Jordan ticked off Cohen's federal crimes. He quoted federal prosecutors, what they had written in court papers about Cohen - that he was motivated by greed, that he used his power to deceptive ends, that he was a fraudster, a cheat, a convict. Cohen himself - he acknowledged his credibility issues. He said that's why he brought documents to back up some of his allegations against Trump. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Right. He brought letters and introduced financial statements and a check, which leads me to ask you this. For all of the hoopla surrounding the testimony today, what struck you as the most significant things we actually learned? RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Well, Cohen spent around a decade working for Trump, so he has a lot of material to pull from. We can't get at all of it. He accused the president of being a racist. He accused him of shady business practices. But one big headline that Cohen made involves WikiLeaks. He says he was in Trump's office in July of 2016 during the campaign when Roger Stone called and Trump put him on speakerphone, Trump being - Stone being a longtime informal adviser to Trump. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Cohen says that Stone told them he had just spoken with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and he said there would be a big email dump in the coming days that would damage Hillary Clinton. So he's saying that Trump knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks emails were coming. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : There's one other thing that stood out. Cohen says that Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow and the lawyer for Jared Kushner reviewed his first statement to Congress. Cohen says Trump's lawyers edited that statement so that he lied about how late into the campaign negotiations over this Trump Tower project in Moscow went. The goal on that was to protect Trump. Cohen has admitted that that statement - that original statement to Congress was a lie, and he's going to serve prison time over it. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : OK, so the new thing here - Cohen had admitted he lied about that. What he added today was that it was Trump's lawyers who edited his statement... RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Right. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...He says. OK, the other thing that struck me was the discussion about hush money payments made to two women who have alleged that they had affairs with Trump. And we got some new details on that. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Right. Cohen brought documents to back up these allegations. We now have a photo of a personal check from Donald Trump with Donald's squiggly signature on it. It's a check for $35,000 to reimburse Cohen for the hush money payment that he made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. The big twist here, though, is that the check is from August of 2017, so that's a check from once Donald Trump was president of the United States. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Signed while he was living in the White House. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Right. Trump has long insisted that he never had an affair with Daniels. He's denied that the payment had anything to do with the campaign. Cohen and federal prosecutors in New York as well say this payment was explicitly to influence the campaign and keep Daniels silent. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : OK, so where does this leave us? Cohen, as we've said, is headed to prison, but we expect that Congress will keep pulling at the threads that he introduced today. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : Right. Cohen has one more day of testimony on the Hill, actually. That's behind closed doors with the House Intelligence Committee. He's promised to cooperate with federal prosecutors if he's asked. There are several ongoing investigations into Trump-related matters, including the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Cohen reports to federal prison in May to serve his three-year sentence. RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE : But as you said, this does not end with Michael Cohen. Again and again today, Democrats asked him to provide the names of people who were witnesses or could corroborate his testimony. He did that. So we may very well see those people called up to Capitol Hill to testify about what they know. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas - thank you, Ryan. \n\n ###",

It's drawn the likes of Tesla and Google. Recently, though, the county, home to about 4,000, has gained notoriety for a different reason. Its top law enforcement official, the sheriff, faces a growing list of serious allegations against him, including rape. His accusers are asking what it will take to unseat him. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : From Nevada, NPR's Leila Fadel has our story. And a caution to listeners - her reporting includes details of sexual assault. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : On most days, Melanie Keener is hidden away in a cubicle in the backroom museum of the Virginia City courthouse. It's a far cry from the job she held as the sheriff's chief deputy. That's what happens, she says, when you cross her former boss, Sheriff Gerald Antinoro. She's suing him for sexual harassment. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : According to her lawsuit, on the last night of a law enforcement convention in Ely, Nev., in 2015, she and her boss went to their rooms. Later... MELANIE KEENER : He sent me some very inappropriate text messages. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : She says the texts appeared to be referring to oral sex. Then, on the about five-hour ride home with her boss... MELANIE KEENER : There was just a - this long narrative of his sexual life and to the point where I didn't know what to say. This is my boss, and I was terrified that I would lose my job. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Over the next eight months, she says, the sheriff grew more hostile toward her. While he was away at a convention she said she couldn't go to, she found the courage to report him to the county. It opened an investigation, but she says it felt like she was being punished. MELANIE KEENER : You know I didn't come forward because I was afraid of losing my job. And then I finally came forward, and it was just - it was like the county had no idea what to do. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : While the sheriff kept his position, HR took her badge, her keys, her gun and reassigned her. She went from being the second-most-powerful person in the sheriff's office to inspecting fire extinguishers and making security maps in a hidden corner of the courthouse - this, even after an internal investigation found that the sheriff violated the sexual harassment policy. MELANIE KEENER : You know they call him Teflon because it doesn't matter what he does wrong, he gets away with it. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Police reports, court proceedings, ethics commission hearings, interviews with lawyers and Antinoro's accusers show a whole range of allegations against him from rape, misusing government resources, to using racial slurs. LAURIE : Sheriff's office. This is Laurie (ph). LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Antinoro was first elected to the sheriff's office in Virginia City, a former gold-mining town, in 2010. He denies the allegations. GERALD ANTINORO : The people of county haven't bought into their nonsense, and they keep returning me to office because obviously somebody thinks I'm doing a good job and that I'm a decent guy. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : That's Antinoro. He says every accusation is political because, he says, some people don't like him enforcing the law. Before his arrival in Storey County as a deputy in 2006, he bounced between different law enforcement jobs in Utah and Nevada. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : 2006 was the same year he allegedly sexually assaulted a woman with another sheriff's office employee, according to a police report filed by the alleged victim. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : I was home sleeping, and I was awakened by the sound of a police radio. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : The woman met with me at a cafe near Storey County. She asked that we not use her name because she's afraid and ashamed of what happened. She says another sheriff's office employee she knew brought Antinoro to her home. She later told police Antinoro raped her at the direction of the other man. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : To cope, she started drinking. Because of the drinking, she says she lost her job and custody of her daughter. \n\n ###",

LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : She's sober now, but it took years for her to get her life together. And in 2014, she says she gathered the courage to report the alleged assault to the police in Sparks, Nev. Even then, she did it under a pseudonym. But the statute of limitations had run out. Every day, she drives through Storey County to get to work. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : And every time I see a Storey County car, I freeze. I feel my blood pressure rising, my pulse racing. I feel sweaty because I think, what if it's one of them? LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Through the Melanie Keener lawsuit, another assault allegation surfaced against Sheriff Antinoro. A woman testified a romantic getaway with the sheriff turned into a gang rape in Lodi, Calif., in 2015. In her deposition, the alleged victim says that Antinoro invited three strangers to the hotel to rape her. She says she never reported the assault because she's, quote, \"scared to death.\" LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : The Nevada attorney general's office spokesperson says her statements were referred to police in Lodi, Calif. A Lodi police spokesperson says they opened an investigation in 2018. They since closed it but won't discuss why to protect the privacy of any potential victim. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : I asked Sheriff Antinoro about the accusations, and he dismisses each one. He points out he's never been prosecuted. The rape in Sparks, Nev... GERALD ANTINORO : It was false then. It's false now. No truth to it whatsoever. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : The orchestrated gang rape... GERALD ANTINORO : That is a complete and utter fabrication. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : The conversation about a sex life with his former chief deputy, Melanie Keener, in the car. He says if it bothered her, she should have said something. As far as the text messages... GERALD ANTINORO : There was no sexual innuendo - never had any interest in her in that manner. It makes me not want to talk to anybody because you can take anything and turn it into sexual connotation. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Everything is either a fabrication or, in the case of things like harassment and racism, people being overly politically correct. He acknowledges he's called white people the N-word but he doesn't see that as racist. So why would so many people make up stories? GERALD ANTINORO : It's a concerted effort by a small group of people to try and remove me from office, plain and simple. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : And what would be the reason behind removing you from office? GERALD ANTINORO : I enforce the rules. I follow the law. I don't give people breaks. LANCE GILMAN : Great story to tell - not true. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : That's Lance Gilman, a real estate developer and one of the people responsible for bringing Tesla and other tech giants to Storey County. He's also the local brothel owner of the Mustang Ranch and a county commissioner. Everyone in town knows about the feud between the local sheriff and the local brothel owner. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : The sheriff says Gilman is conspiring against him because he doesn't rubberstamp permits at the brothel. Gilman says that's a lie. He's suing for defamation. Gilman helped lead a failed recall effort in 2017. LANCE GILMAN : We've used every avenue we know of to say look at this. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE : Melanie Keener's lawyer wrote to the Nevada attorney general's office demanding an investigation into all the allegations against the sheriff. A statement from the attorney general's office said after hundreds of hours of investigating, the office found, quote, \"no criminal conduct within its office's jurisdiction.\" That lawyer also represents Gilman. \n\n ###",

Today, he testified before Congress that his former boss was a racist, a con man and a cheat. This testimony comes just a couple of months before Cohen goes to prison for crimes that include lying to Congress and covering up what Cohen called Trump's dirty deeds. One of those deeds was paying off women who say they slept with Trump. The president denies those affairs. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Today, Cohen produced a check signed by Donald Trump in 2017 after he was in the White House. Cohen said that check was reimbursement for one of those hush money payments. MICHAEL COHEN : The president of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : In another part of the program, we're hearing from a Democrat who questioned Cohen today. And we are joined now by one of the Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RALPH NORMAN : Well, thank you, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Everyone went into this hearing with expectations for what would happen and what they would hear. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : What did you hear or see today from Michael Cohen that surprised you? RALPH NORMAN : Well, I guess the main thing, Ari, he really wasn't - he apologized, and he, you know, said he was a changed man. And my questioning, along with others, said, well, you know, is he really repentant or is he - did he just get caught? And... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : I think a lot of Republicans were very concerned that he was lying again under oath, given that he has lied under oath to Congress before. But one question I have for you is, even if you set aside every unverified claim that Cohen made and assume that he is a liar, he's introduced a pile of documents as evidence. There was that hush money reimbursement check we mentioned. There are copies of financial statements, letters, articles with the president's handwriting. Even if he is a serial liar, does it concern you that these documents appear to connect President Trump to crimes? RALPH NORMAN : Well, here's the question. One - with the payment for the women, that's old news. But that's fine. Let him produce the documents. Let him - he says he's been looking, you know, for, I think, weeks and months for boxes of documents. Let's get them out. We're not trying to hide anything. And I guess, you know, where were the documents? Where are they now? RALPH NORMAN : And we came in, and the fact that he - you know, I'm not interested in Michael Cohen's opinion. The fact that he will be in an orange jumpsuit in less than 90 days, it's obvious for the record what he's admitted to - tax fraud, bank - signing fraudulent bank statements. He's guilty of that. And yeah, it makes us suspect on anything he says. RALPH NORMAN : But - and he came out with - and this really got me - when he came out, the man that he says he would take a bullet for, that he respected, he worked for a decade, and then he said, you know, he's a cheat. And my question to him was, Mr. Cohen, you were his personal lawyer for 10 years, who you respected. You illegally recorded him, wiretapped him. And... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Congressman, I would like to drill down on something that you said, though, that - where you referred to the hush money payments as old news because the fact that President Trump wrote a personal check to Michael Cohen to reimburse him for those hush money payments - which have been documented to have been a campaign finance violation - that's not old news. That's something we learned today, that he made that payment from his personal account while he was in the White House. Does that concern you? RALPH NORMAN : Well, it is what it is. And let's let the documents show, and let's let the public - and let's let it be of record, as anything else he has. So you know, that'll be played out as it is. You can't change that. Where were they... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : I mean, I guess the question put bluntly is do you believe the president was complicit in these crimes that Michael Cohen is going to prison for? RALPH NORMAN : Well, after they examine the records, let's see what happens. Let's see how they judge it. But my issue is why did he wait this long? And if that's all he has - you know, he was on the record today of no collusion. I thought that with the Mueller investigation... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : With Russia, you mean? RALPH NORMAN : With Russia. I thought with the Mueller investigation, you know, this was going to prove Donald Trump - they're laying the groundwork to impeach the president. That's what this is about. And anything... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Well, you're saying you're undecided as to whether the president was complicit in crimes or not. If the president was complicit in crimes, then whether or not the president should be impeached seems to be an open question. \n\n ###",

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : His name was Duke. He was a dog. He was also the honorary mayor of Cormorant, a tiny village in rural Minnesota. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Duke was a Great Pyrenees, big and fluffy and white. And for the first half of his life, he was just a humble farm dog. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Then one day back in 2014, the village decided to hold an election of sorts. It was mostly a fundraiser for the community. TRICIA MALONEY : Let's do a dollar a vote and put a big sign up that says, OK, vote for your favorite person that you would like to have mayor of Cormorant Village. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : That's Tricia Maloney, who owns The Cormorant Pub. She is one of the people who first came up with the idea. She says Duke, while, OK, yes, not technically a person, was already a local celebrity. TRICIA MALONEY : So many people went, oh, you can vote for mayor. Let's vote for Mayor Duke. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And Duke won by a landslide, so they swore him in. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : If you accept this challenge and these responsibilities, please raise your right paw and bark. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Well, Duke panted, looked out at his constituents and stayed silent. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE : Yay. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : Close enough. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : That was just the beginning. Karen Nelson helped raise Duke and describes herself as his adopted mom. KAREN NELSON : When they first said Duke, everybody just kind of thought, oh, yeah, it was just going to be a big joke. But the newspaper got a hold of it and the TV station, and then it just went viral. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : He made national and international headlines and became an icon for Cormorant. His portrait is at the top of the township's website, wearing his signature top hat. Here's Nelson. KAREN NELSON : He always loved the kids hanging on him and petting him. And when we did the parades, he'd sit on the back of this red convertible, and he just held his head so high and proud. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Duke served four one-year terms as honorary mayor, so 28 dog years. When he retired last year... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : ...The village wrote him a song. UNIDENTIFIED SINGER : (Singing) You might think that it's quite strange this dog became the mayor, but Cormorant Village thought it through. It was fair and square.

Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from Planet Money's The Indicator tell us what the regulations would have done for consumers and what it's like to be in a debt cycle with payday lenders. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : Amy Marineau took out her first payday loan nearly 20 years ago. Amy was living in Detroit with her husband and three little kids. She says the bills had started to feel crushing. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Amy went into the payday lending store to just see if she could get a loan, just a little one. AMY MARINEAU : I felt like, yes, I can pay this bill. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Amy says it felt like she could breathe again, at least for a couple of weeks. That is when she needed to pay the payday lender back with interest, of course. AMY MARINEAU : You have to pay 676.45. That's a lot of money. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : You still remember the amount. AMY MARINEAU : That 676.45 - it just now popped in my head. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : That extra 76.45 was just the interest on the loan for two weeks. Play that out over a year, and that's an annual interest rate of more than 300 percent. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : But when she went back into the payday loan store a couple weeks later, it felt like she couldn't pay it back quite yet, so she took out another payday loan to pay off the 676.45. AMY MARINEAU : Because something else went wrong. It was always something - something coming up, which is life. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Amy and her husband started using payday loans to pay off credit cards and credit cards to pay off payday loans. And the amount they owed kept climbing and climbing. AMY MARINEAU : You feel defeated. You're like, when is this ever going to end? Am I ever going to be financially stable? Am I ever going to get there? CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : And this is, of course, why the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had planned to put payday loan regulations in place later this year. Those new rules were announced under the Obama administration and would've restricted who payday lenders could lend to. Namely, they would only be able to lend to people who could prove a high likelihood that they could immediately pay the loan back. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : How much of a difference would those regulations have made in the industry? RONALD MANN : I think it would've made a lot of difference. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Ronald Mann is an economist and a professor at Columbia Law School. He's spent more than a decade studying payday loans. And Ronald says the regulations would've basically ended the payday loan industry because it would've eliminated around 75 to 80 percent of payday loans' customer base. RONALD MANN : I mean, these are products that are - there's a fair chance people aren't going to be able to pay them back. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Ronald says that is exactly why about 20 states have either banned payday loans entirely or really restricted them. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : On the other hand, more than 30 states don't really have restrictions at all on payday lending. And in those states, payday lending has gotten huge, or, you might say, supersized. \n\n ###",

He's been sentenced to three years, having pleaded guilty to campaign finance and other crimes. But first, Cohen says he wants to give, quote, \"a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\" ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : The venue for that - three congressional hearings this week. Two will be behind closed doors, but Cohen's testimony before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform will unfold in full public view. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : The man who'll gavel that hearing to order 10:00 o'clock Wednesday morning is Elijah Cummings. He's a Democrat from Maryland. He chairs the House Oversight Committee. And he joins me now from his home in Baltimore. Congressman, welcome. ELIJAH CUMMINGS : It's good to be with you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : So Michael Cohen, as you know, has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. What makes you think he will be a credible witness now? ELIJAH CUMMINGS : Well, we don't know. I have practiced law for more than 20 years. And you have a situation where a man apparently wants to bare his soul and talk about his relationship with this president. Keep in mind that Michael Cohen is the one person who has accused the president of committing a crime. So it's hard to say what's going to happen. ELIJAH CUMMINGS : But the good thing about it is that members of Congress will have an opportunity to observe him. The public will have an opportunity to observe him. And I think that's a good thing. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : But did it give you pause to give him such a prominent platform, given his history of lying to Congress? ELIJAH CUMMINGS : Of course. But at the same time, we have a situation where it's quite possible we may never see the light of day what Mr. Mueller does because there's a lot of discretion that the attorney general has with regard to releasing anything that comes out of the Mueller investigation. And so the - it's quite possible that the public never would have an opportunity to hear directly or see him. ELIJAH CUMMINGS : On the other hand, we have the president. The president, you know, almost on a daily basis has talked about how he has not committed any crimes and has basically called Michael Cohen a liar. So I think it's only fair to Michael Cohen and to the president that representatives of the people - that is Republicans and Democrats in the Congress - have an opportunity to ask questions. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : What's your top question for Michael Cohen? What are you going to ask? ELIJAH CUMMINGS : We'll be looking at subjects such as the president's debt and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election, the president's compliance with financial disclosure laws, the president's potential and actual conflicts of interests, the president's business practices and the Trump International Hotel in Washington. And it's - and accuracy with regard to reporting data to the Congress. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You've got a couple of firsts going on here. This is Cohen's first major public appearance since he turned on the president. This is also the first big marquee hearing for the Democratic-controlled House. And I wonder why Michael Cohen, who, A, we've talked about, has a history of lying to Congress - B, the questions you're describing don't seem to have anything to do with Trump's conduct as president or his administration's policies. ELIJAH CUMMINGS : No, that's not accurate. First of all, you got to understand, our jurisdiction... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You're talking about stuff from 2016, from the campaign, which is important, but... ELIJAH CUMMINGS : Yeah, I got that. But our jurisdiction - and the main thing that my committee is for is making sure that government functions properly. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : But is there a risk of it looking like Democrats are determined to just keep digging through the tawdry chapters of the president's life - testimony about a porn star and a Playboy model - instead of exercising serious oversight over his administration? ELIJAH CUMMINGS : Well, that's interesting that you said that because you're inaccurate. The first thing we did was a drug hearing. We had a hearing on drugs - prescription drug. That was our first major marquee hearing. Our second major marquee hearing was one where we talked about HR1, which deals with voting rights and corruption in government. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Safe to say HR1 didn't quite have the TV networks buzzing in the way that Michael Cohen is going to be, but go on. ELIJAH CUMMINGS : Yeah. But my point is, what are we supposed to do, sit back on our hands when we see that there may be problems in the executive branch, when the Constitution clearly states that it is our job? We have sworn to be a check and balance on the executive branch, and that's exactly what we're doing, period. \n\n ###",

ROBERT KING : Well, the scale of human rights abuses in North Korea is actually fairly well-known. We're marking the fifth anniversary this month of the report of the Commission of Inquiry, a U.N. human rights commission. They concluded that, in fact, there are crimes against humanity being committed in North Korea. They had a number of North Koreans who had fled North Korea and were able to talk about conditions there. They had experts who talked about what we can see from satellite images. So I mean, we know quite a bit about what's happening. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : That quote we heard from President Trump - an estimated 100,000 people in North Korean gulags suffering from torture, starvation, rape and murder. Does that sound accurate to you? ROBERT KING : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : There wasn't any progress on this issue in the last meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un. Do you think this time will be any different? ROBERT KING : There's no indication of it. What the problem seems to be is that the Trump administration - at least Trump has used human rights not as something we need to work on but as a stick to beat the North Koreans until they come around to talking about nuclear weapons. He was very careful to mention human rights in his United Nations speech in the fall of 2017. He mentioned it in 2018 in his State of the Union address. ROBERT KING : After the summit was set up, nary a word from the White House on human rights conditions in North Korea. It wasn't raised in the last summit. There's no indication so far that it's going to be raised in this summit. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : President Trump said they did discuss this at the summit in Singapore, though relatively briefly compared to the issue of denuclearization. But he says it did come up. ROBERT KING : It may have been raised. The North Koreans certainly didn't engage on the issue. And there was nothing mentioned by the North Koreans about human rights in their take on the summit, which suggests - wasn't an issue for them. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Well, what do you think a reasonable expectation is? What is achievable? ROBERT KING : Well, the first thing is raising the issue. I don't think we start with the worst problem, the most sensitive issues. But there are things that we ought to do in terms of encouraging the flow of information, for example. North Koreans are extremely limited in terms of their access to information about what is going on, both in their own country and outside. The government controls information very tightly. That's an area where we could make progress. ROBERT KING : We could press the North Koreans for more contact, for more openness, more travel for North Koreans. There are a number of areas we could work on. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Is there an argument that because North Korea has the ability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles at the United States, it makes sense for a president to prioritize that over an issue like human rights abuses? ROBERT KING : There's no question that North Korea's military capability is the most important issue that we face in terms of dealing with North Korea. But we're trying to get North Korea to accept international standards in terms of nonproliferation - this kind of thing. ROBERT KING : The North Koreans have undertaken to accept international standards in human rights. They are signatories to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If we let them get away with doing nothing on human rights when they've committed themselves to observe those human rights obligations, what does that say about our ability to press the North Koreans to make progress on international nuclear standards we're trying to get them to accept? \n\n ###",

Coming up, the next primary is in Puerto Rico. We're going to hear from a political analyst there who says it's not clear that Senator Hillary Clinton is going to do well. But first, the average price of gas is approaching four dollars a gallon on this Memorial Day. It's expected to keep on climbing. That coupled with a soft economy is worrying businesses that depend on summer tourists. We sent reporter Joel Rose to the beach recently for the latest instalment in our series, The Bottom Line. JOEL ROSE : It's sunny but cool today in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with a stiff wind off the ocean.  There are almost as many seagulls on the boardwalk as tourists. In a few weeks, this boardwalk will be mobbed, or, at least, that's what the merchants here are hoping. One of those merchants is Marie Kilpatrick(ph). She manages Dolle's Candyland, the corner of Rehoboth Avenue and the boardwalk. Ms. MARIE KILPATRICK (Merchant, Dolle's Candyland) : We're not as busy. We're hoping this weekend they're saying it's going to really be beautiful. So I'm trying to hope, and keep our fingers crossed. JOEL ROSE : Kilpatrick has worked at Dolle's for 10 years. She says this is the slowest she's ever seen it. Kilpatrick says some of her customers are buying smaller boxes of caramel corn fudge and saltwater toffee than they normally do. And she's worried that's a sign of things to come. Ms. MARIE KILPATRICK (Merchant, Dolle's Candyland) : If they come down, it may be just for a day or two with the gas prices. And they're going to watch their money. I can see that. But, you know, people want caramel corn, people want toffee, they're going to come down here regardless. Mr. KOSTAS SARCOLIS (Manager, Robin Hood Restaurant) : This might be the most challenging time in the last 15 years. JOEL ROSE : Kostas Sarcolis (ph) manages the Robin Hood Restaurant about half a block from the boardwalk. He says shop owners in town are nervous that rising gas prices will mean fewer beachgoers this summer. Mr. KOSTAS SARCOLIS (Manager, Robin Hood Restaurant) : It's a little daunting to think about, you know, four dollar gas. And it's scary. JOEL ROSE : Everybody's holding their breath trying to see what it means. Mr. KOSTAS SARCOLIS (Manager, Robin Hood Restaurant) : Yeah, yeah. JOEL ROSE : The story is similar a few miles up the coast in Lewes, Delaware. Betsy Reimer(ph) runs the local Chamber of Commerce. Ms. BETSY REIMER (Lewes Chamber of Commerce) : For the businesses, summertime is for a lot of them, make or break. We are a tank of gas drive from big, metropolitan areas. The Philly area, Baltimore, Washington area. And we're just hoping that they'll say, well, instead of driving maybe four hours to another beach destination, we'll do the two hour drive to this area. JOEL ROSE : One hotel here isn't just hoping, the Greystone Inn Bed and Breakfast is offering to buy 20 dollars worth of gas for anyone who stays at least two nights. Mr. MITCH MYERS (Proprietor, Greystone Inn Bed & Breakfast) : The astute traveler who wants to go to the beach is going to go anyhow. But if there's any way that I can entice them, that's what I'll do. JOEL ROSE : Still, proprietor Mitch Myers(ph) says B&B's all over Delaware are bracing for an off year. Mr. MITCH MYERS (Proprietor, Greystone Inn Bed & Breakfast) : Everyone thinks we're going to have probably a 10 to 15 percent less in terms of people and overnight stays on what we had last year. That's what I really think. I hope I'm wrong. Mr. MITCH MYERS (Proprietor, Greystone Inn Bed & Breakfast) : Unidentified Announcer: May I have you attention please... JOEL ROSE : High gas prices haven't stopped the traveler on this ferry boat from Delaware to New Jersey though some like Judy Balser(ph) of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, took a bus to the Jersey shore instead of driving. Ms. JUDY BALSER (Holidaymaker) : All that travel, is all included in a package, so cheaper than buying gas for a car. We have done this before. But now it's even a better deal because now we think, how could we afford to do it with the price of gas? JOEL ROSE : Several other travellers told me they're planning shorter trips this summer to save money including Tera Pazulo(ph) of Wakefield, Rhode Island. \n\n ###",

I'm John Donvan, in Washington. Neal Conan is off. It is taking a huge risk to let the New York Times reveal in its pages the minute and most personal details of your love life. And the reason the Times even cares to write about the relationship you're in, it's not because you're running for office or because you're a movie star. It's because you are a teenager who has Asperger's syndrome. And by the way, the other person in your relationship is also a teenager with Asperger's syndrome. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Teenagers Jack Robison, who is 19, and Kirsten Lindsmith, who is 18, took that risk. They told their story to writer Amy Harmon of the New York Times, and the risk was worth taking. The resulting piece is a beautiful, inspiring, funny, moving, sometimes sad look at love on the autism spectrum - because that's what Asperger's syndrome is, it is a way that the brain is wired that is sometimes described as a form of autism, but where the person who has it is generally intelligent or above average in intelligence and well-spoken. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : But the difficult part of life is in reading social cues. It's missing the joke that everybody else gets. It's not knowing that what you're talking about is boring the life out of everybody else in the room. It's having a tendency to obsess on narrow topics, maybe having some set routines that cannot be interfered with. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : It's the sort of thing you would assume that can really get in the way of a romantic relationship, especially as you move into the categories of more severe autism. But we are here to discuss both the right of people on the autism spectrum to love and to be loved, and the ways to overcome the obstacles that may come with autism. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : If this is your story, or if it's your child's story, we want to ask you: What has gotten in the way of love? And how have you gotten around it? Give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can also join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Later on in this hour, we're going to be talking with Peter Gerhardt. He is a specialist on adolescents and adults with autism, and on the place of love, romance and sex in their lives. But first, this couple that is making their own way in this world, as seen in the New York Times, Jack Robison and Kirsten Lindsmith join us from a studio at New England Public Radio in Amherst, Massachusetts. Welcome, both of you, to the program. JACK ROBISON : Hi. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Hi. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hi. Jack, you just heard my description of Asperger's. Take a moment and add to it or correct me, or just if I got it right, let me know that, too. JACK ROBISON : I think that you got many aspects of it. I think the biggest thing is that Asperger's is sort of a way of being rather than, like, a condition that you have. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Mm-hmm. Do you feel the same, Kirsten? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Oh, yeah. I agree. I'm - it's been pathologized as of late, but I would consider it more of a type of person rather than a disease. Also just a minor correction, the beginning of the article introduced our ages when we got together. Now I'm 20, and Jack is 21. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You have aged. All right, you have matured and ripened, so that is good for a radio broadcast. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : A little bit. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So I hear you saying that having Asperger's or not is being tall or short or fat or thin. It's in that sort of category in terms of a way of being. So - but you do talk about, and you have talked about the ways in which it may complicate having a relationship. And I want to talk - let's go to an interesting moment in your lives, your first kiss. Jack, from your side of the experience, how was that? How did it go? What happened? JACK ROBISON : Well, I guess it was the first night that we spent together, and I was - well, I don't like kissing as much as Kirsten does, but I sort of went along with it. But I don't know. I, the next day, explained my reluctance, sort of, but I tried to play along. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And what was your explanation, if I may ask? JACK ROBISON : That I didn't like the sensation of it terribly much, and that I was not as enthusiastic as a consequence. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And Kirsten, you're on the other side of that kiss. What was your experience of it? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Well, it's - let's see. I have to think about this before answering - that it wasn't really surprising or confusing why he didn't like kissing, because I'd encountered people before who didn't but who weren't autistic. And he basically explained that it felt to him literally what it was, just two people mashing their mouths together, and that it wasn't - it didn't activate, you know, the kind of romantic inclinations it does in other people who like kissing, that it just felt like pushing faces into another face. And so - sigh. But, alas, it's something that comes with the package. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, you seem to like the package. What is this, what we're talking about now, have to with Asperger's syndrome, Kirsten? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Well, Asperger's is much more than just social awkwardness. It's kind of often painted as a social nerd disease, where really, it's more of a full-body thing. A lot of autism and Asperger's has to do with sensory differences. And so, for example, people with Asperger's will react differently to stimuli like touch or sound or smell. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : And so where the sensation of wetness on a face might not bother someone who's neurotypical, it might seem overwhelming to someone with autism. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I just want to jump on a term that you just used, because I think we're going to be hearing it again. The term neurotypical is a term that refers to everybody who is not in any way on the autism spectrum, typically - those who have a typical neurological makeup or assumed to have such. And sometimes it's shortened to nypical, is that correct? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : According to Jack's father. Personally, I don't like the term neurotypical because it implies that if you don't have autism, you are normal. And I think that very few people would be called truly neurotypical, and that even if one is not on the autism spectrum, there might be differences in other areas, people who think differently. Everybody's different. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Right. Who wants to be neurotypical, when you put it that way? Jack, what had been your experience in terms of dating up to this point? We're talking about - so last year, the year before. You were 18, 19. What was your experience in dating up to that point? JACK ROBISON : Well, I had had a girlfriend pretty consistently through high school, from when I was a sophomore on until the end of high school. And I don't know, I sort of - that was an ongoing one where my friends had, you know, girlfriends for a month or two there. That was what I had instead. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Why was that? What was happening? JACK ROBISON : Well, I don't know. I got along with her quite well, and so I didn't have a reason to cut it short, and, you know, I don't know. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So that's a mystery to you. You didn't get an explanation from when the breakups came that made sense to you? JACK ROBISON : Well, I don't know. It sort of - it was a sort of stretched-out thing, and yeah. I don't know. It sort of - we sort of grew apart more, I guess, and it became the thing to do. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Did you tend - we mentioned earlier in the broadcast that - your interest in chemistry, and that one of the characteristics of somebody who has Asperger's is to be really quite focused on a few, a set of small topics, but in great depth and to want to share that or talk about that with people who may not be interested. And did chemistry get in the way in that way for you? JACK ROBISON : Not with her as much, although there - certainly, it was a point of stress for me because it was something that, you know, I care about a great deal, and she didn't really care about it at all. So, you know, I wanted to talk about the things that I thought were really neat that I was reading about, but she didn't really want to hear about it, and neither did my friends, really. So that was sort of a disappointment. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And did you have to learn to take that cue, to take the message that I've got to stop talking about chemistry now? JACK ROBISON : Yeah, I sort of learned to, you know, talk about it on, you know, forums with people who were also interested in it and not with as many, you know, of my real-life peers. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And is that a difficult adjustment to make? JACK ROBISON : I wouldn't - I'd say it's more frustrating than anything because, you know, I'll have something in my head that I want to tell everyone about, but I know they really don't care. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So Kirsten, what was your story, your dating history before meeting Jack? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : I have had more significant others than Jack, though not very many. Let's see. When I was about 15 or so, a sophomore in high school, I briefly dated one of my best friends. And when I say dated, I mean that we went on one date and - where we just sat next to each other and ate sandwiches, and it was very awkward. And for the rest of the time when we were dating, we basically did not change our relationship at all from friends because I was so awkward, and he even had to ask permission to hug me. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : But - and so that broke off pretty quickly. And then after that, I briefly dated very casually another guy in my class who I didn't know very well, and that was sort of like we went to the movies, that sort of thing. \n\n ###",

KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Oh, no. I was awkward, as in I can't even really articulate why, but I was - I think I would most articulate it as I was not ready for a relationship. I was still stuck in kind of the childlike mindset of, oh, people will know that I like somebody, and that's bad, that people will make fun of me for liking somebody, and that even somehow even if he were to know that I liked him - like, I didn't want to hug him or kiss him because then he would know that I liked him, even though we were dating and we obviously were supposed to like each other, that it was sort of somehow embarrassing for me. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : For both of you, for both of you - and - well, I want to get to this point, Kirsten. You found out after your relationship began to deepen with Jack, that's when you found out that you have Asperger's syndrome. Is that correct? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Yeah. I did not know. I didn't get a diagnosis until the summer of 2010, when I was 19. And so I - I suspected when I first started dating Jack, because I knew that he had Asperger's. And so I Googled it, read about it on Wikipedia, learned it was a form of autism, read more about autism, that sort of thing. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : And I noticed that I perfectly fit all the diagnostic criteria, which I thought was very interesting. But I was sort of in the mindset of, oh, I must be being a hypochondriac and I - there's nothing wrong with me. How dare I consider myself to have this disease that real people suffer from - because I didn't know anything about it. And it was really Jack who convinced me that I had it. And I sought an official diagnosis. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Was that a relief to know? Did it give you an explanation? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Oh, yes, because I - in my kind of efforts to get a diagnosis, I ended up going a few places that couldn't give me one. So I set myself with a therapist who I thought would diagnose me, but she told me that she couldn't. But she didn't know anything about autism, and she just decided to run over the criteria with me. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : And she said that she didn't believe I had autism because I have friends, and that she was on the fence. And she asked: What would you say if you didn't have autism? And I would say: Well, I must have something else because, like, otherwise, I'm just broken. And getting a diagnosis really helped me realize that I'm not - there's nothing wrong with me. All the problems that I have, the deficiencies I have are not my fault and that I'm perfectly normal. I'm just a normal autistic. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And I'd like to get a sense from both of you of what that knowledge means in terms of what you actually then do. And we're going to take a break, and I want to ask those questions when we come back.

For people like my guests today, Kirsten Lindsmith and Jack Robison, who have Asperger's syndrome, the social cues that help the romantically inclined gauge interest and to fall in love can be mysterious. But there are skills that adolescents and adults with autism can learn that will help them grow into independent adults with fulfilling lives, and fulfilling lives includes love lives.

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : As I mentioned, Jack Robison and Kirsten Lindsmith are my guests, and we're looking to hear your stories, as well, and we want to start with a story from Commerce, Michigan, and Roger(ph), who is joining us on TALK OF THE NATION. Roger, hello. ROGER : Hi. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hi. ROGER : I myself was an occupational therapy student and did not get diagnosed until my level two of field work, and I had to leave the program afterwards because of it. I'm - and one thing I found is when I attended group therapy sessions, sometimes it's people have a hard time expressing it, sometimes it's reading certain types of behaviors. ROGER : And me in my case, I - it was actually I learned that actually when girls are trying to hit on me, that was one of the behaviors that I honestly cannot read, period. And needless to say, that caused quite a bit of complications in my life. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Yeah, we can imagine, and is it something that you were able to make an adjustment to? ROGER : No, it's something I've never solved it from. Recently, now that I'm 37 years old, I've taken some advice trying out some dating websites and stuff, and it's been a problem that's not been solved because it's, well, hard to tell if someone's interested if I honestly cannot read it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, interesting question. You're talking about face-to-face interaction, and I'm wondering, since you say that you're using Internet sites, does it make a difference if you're looking at text and, you know, you have a little bit of an opportunity to think through the language that's going in two directions? Does it make a difference if it's online? ROGER : I honestly don't know yet. To be honest, it's because it's first seeing if someone's interested, if someone's online, if someone's on a dating site, you're obviously interested in dating. So if I get a hit, it must be - in some way I know that someone's interested because that's the only way I guess I could find out unless someone tells me they're interested, and through text, they have to tell me they're interested. I can't read the non-verbal cues that other girls, you know, give off. \n\n ###",

ROGER : (Unintelligible) to read and pick up on and I've been told by other people. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So you need to hear the words clearly and expressly stated. ROGER : They have to say that hey, I'm interested, do you want to go on a date? I guess it would be like that type of direct. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Yeah, I can see where that's going to be a challenge. Roger, thanks very much for sharing your story with us. And it's very brave of you to do that and the same with, I think, Jack and Kirsten to be talking about this and everybody who's calling. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We have an email from Boene Omissar(ph), if I've pronounced that correctly. I'm sorry, it's from Randy Scott(ph) in Houston, who writes: My main obstacle to romance has been the lack of people who understand the personality differences. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : When I was young, there was no such thing as Asperger's, and everyone around me simply regarded me as weird. None of my relationships have lasted more than a few months, just long enough for her to get to know me. Now I'm 54, and I'm still single. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Jack and Kirsten, and particularly to you, Jack, are there things as you became aware of your diagnosis and became aware of these challenges that you tried to do to change or to adapt or to adjust to make the communication work better. JACK ROBISON : I would say that the biggest thing that I - I mean, I think that I made people bored a lot, and I still sort of do when I talk about the things I'm interested in, and that was sort of one of the biggest things that I guess I can say that I actually changed about myself, where, you know, I don't walk up to strangers and tell them about, you know, quadricopter, my, you know, four-propellered helicopter, that I don't think that they're terribly interested in it. JACK ROBISON : And, you know, instead I, you know, let them talk or, you know, see what they want to talk about instead, and... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You know, I want to mention I happen to know your dad. His name is John Alva Robison(ph), who is - was diagnosed with Asperger's at the age of I think 39, who wrote a bestseller about it called \"Look Me In the Eye.\" He wrote another book called \"Be Different,\" which essentially is a guide for people who have - who are living his life, you know, how to make it work. And he's also now working on a book about you. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And in all of this, he talks about his effort to try to connect and literally talks about studying books on etiquette and looking at films about etiquette to try and figure out what he's supposed to be doing. This is a younger man even before he had his diagnosis. I'm wondering: Do either of you go to that - take those sorts of steps to fill in the gaps on what's on somebody's face as they're talking to you, to try to learn that way? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Oh, I definitely do. I don't know about Jack, but I - the Internet is a wonderful tool. I've found myself Googling things like body-language dictionary. And I found a website that has a very comprehensive body-language dictionary, and I learned things like, for example, if someone is talking to you and squinting one eye, that means that they are talking down to you from a superior position, often giving orders. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : And I realized that my old boss used to talk to me this way, and I had always assumed he had some sort of facial tic because he would squint one eye when talking. And now that I'm aware of it, I see it everywhere. Even on TV, actors will unintentionally do - will do it, or maybe intentionally, but that I - things like that I pick up on now that I've learned it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : But you needed to be - you didn't just absorb it, you needed to essentially read about it or be told about it, and then you can notice it? KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Yeah, like I have a slightly easier job reading signals and facial expressions than maybe the more average autistic, but I know that, like, say different types of smiles, I can recognize a genuine smile from a non-genuine smile, or at least I think I can. But more subtle things like the direction that a palm is facing when someone is gesticulating apparently has a lot of meaning that that doesn't come naturally to me. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : I can learn it, but that's stuff that I don't pick up on. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Although people who can read don't know that they can read it. I mean, they're not even sure what they're reading. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : Yeah, neurotypicals probably could not tell you why they knew, like, the person talking to them was being condescending or why they knew that person was just being polite and didn't really like them but was just pretending, but they know it. They couldn't say oh, it was because the corner of his mouth twitched like this and that his palm was facing down when he spoke to me, and things like that. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I want to bring into the conversation now Peter Gerhardt. Peter Gerhardt is chairperson of the Scientific Council at the Organization for Autism Research, and he's the director of education at the Upper School at the McCarton School, which is a school for autistic kids in New York. And Peter, you join us from our bureau in New York. Welcome to the program. \n\n ###",

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And Peter, you - I need to tell our audience also that nationally, you are recognized as the most advanced thinker on the topic of adolescents and adults with autism, including the issue, especially the issue of sexuality, in part because as you once said, nobody else wanted to go into this field back 25 years ago when you got into it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And I'm curious, what we were just talking about with Kirsten and Jack, is this whole notion of learning, of learning to be able to navigate love and sex. Is it learnable? Is there a way forward if you find that you have these obstacles? PETER GERHARDT : It's definitely learnable. It's learnable for all of us if - I think it's probably one of the most challenging skill sets that any of us develop is how to be in a productive, caring, loving relationship. For the, you know, individuals with, you know, Asperger's syndrome, who I work with, it often comes down to just being able to effectively translate your own needs not only to your partner but to the person around you. PETER GERHARDT : Now I know that sounds very sort of psychobabble-ish, you know, but for someone on the spectrum for whom kissing is uncomfortable, like in Jack's case, like being able to say that, you know, understand what the consequences may be but being very comfortable with it, I mean, that's the sort of core negotiating point, I think, that when relationship progress, you have to be more and more willing to discuss these big issues. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And as you say, Pete, for anybody, you know, love, sex, romance is a minefield, and it's very, very easy for anybody to miss cues. But I'm wondering, is it a particular minefield for somebody who's on the autism spectrum, versus other challenges, such as being able to shop and make change and to get on a bus and travel, you know, which, depending on where one is on the spectrum, can be challenging, as well. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Are love, sex and romance more - is there more risk in that field? PETER GERHARDT : Well, there's more risk in many ways, and it's more complex in many ways because, you know, the basis of a romantic relationship is this social connectedness, is this ability to communicate with your partner, which, you know, may be different for - is different for someone on this spectrum than it may be for someone who is neurotypical, or even two people on the spectrum may communicate somewhat different. PETER GERHARDT : And then you get into the issue of sex, which I think a big issue across the spectrum. It doesn't matter where you fall on the spectrum. I work with guys who have more classic autism, who are less verbal, you know, and they're sexual beings. And how do we address their needs while still being respectful and safe and, you know, professional? It's a very, very complex issue. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right, I want to go back to some calls from listeners. But first, I want to thank Jack and Kirsten for joining us and for having the, really, the courage to let their story be the one that's kicked off this conversation. Jack Robison and Kirsten Lindsmith joined us from the studios of New England Public Radio in Amherst, Massachusetts. Jack and Kirsten, thanks very much for your time and for sharing this way. KIRSTEN LINDSMITH : You're welcome. JACK ROBISON : Thanks for having us as well. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure. And if you like to hear more about their story, you can find a link to The New York Times profile at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Again, to both of you, thank you very much for your time today. I want to go then to some callers, and Linda in Oakland is joining us. Linda, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. LINDA : Hi. I have a 17-year-old son with autism. I want to make two points: One is not everybody with autism has Asperger's syndrome as Peter Gerhardt just pointed out. And there is no acknowledgement whatsoever of my son's needs to have social interaction with peers, to express his very normal, teenage, adolescent feelings toward others, et cetera. It's really, really, really a big problem. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : What are your aspirations for him, Linda? What's his name? LINDA : His name is Sam. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sam. So what are your aspirations for Sam in that regard? In the regard of love and being loved? LINDA : I'd like him to be able to be with peers and have people know how to relate to him, to have people not be afraid of him. If a normal child in his - and I know the normal word is controversial. If a 17-year-old boy in his high school puts his arm around somebody, that's considered fine. My son puts his arm around somebody, he gets an incident report. So there's a lot of non-acknowledgement of the needs of many of these teenagers, adolescents, young adults who may not have language, who may have all the needs that everybody else has... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Linda, I want to interrupt to ask you to go back and clarify something because it's important. When you said, when your son puts his arm around somebody, he gets a - what are people thinking when he does that? LINDA : They're thinking that he's touching somebody inappropriately. \n\n ###",

That's what I wanted to have you come out and say because Pete has strong feelings about that whole issue. Pete, go ahead. PETER GERHARDT : Well, you know, it's very true. And when I talk to professionals about the issue of sexuality and relationships on the autism spectrum, they often say, well, parents don't want to deal with this, parents are afraid to deal with this. And then when I talk to parents about the issue, they say, well, professionals don't want to deal with it. So what ends up is nobody deals with it, and it becomes, sort of this, you know, elephant in the living room that nobody is really dealing with. So we end up with situations where, you know, for her son, you know, simple physical contact is seen almost as a precursor to a sexual assault, where, in effect, it may be just simple physical contact in most cases. PETER GERHARDT : And - which I think sort of goes back to this, you know, I have a friend Donna, who's on the spectrum, has Asperger's syndrome. And we were discussing social events one time and she commented that, you know, if you neurotypicals have all the skills, why don't you adapt for a while, damn it? And I really started to think that, you know, we wouldn't, I guess - and she said, if I was a person who used a wheelchair, you wouldn't say, well, I'd love to hire you but you have to walk first. And we often do that to folks on the spectrum because we fail to address the issue of translating to the other side. What do neurotypicals know about people with autism? What can they do to better interact? How can they understand this person? I really think we're missing a big part of the equation when we don't do that. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : OK. Linda, thank you very much for your call. We appreciate it. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Our topic is autism, love and sex, and where they intersect. And we're asking you to tell your stories if you are on the autism spectrum or if you know somebody, if it's your children, close friend, to talk about love and the obstacles to it when - in expressing it when you're on the autism spectrum. And I want to go now to Michael in Fayette, Alabama. Michael, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. MICHAEL : Good afternoon. Thanks big time for taking my call. You can tell by my stuttering English already, as in so many other past episodes of TALK OF THE NATION, that I have Asperger's myself, but also adult ADD, very mild - night-time epilepsy, and I'm just getting over obsessive compulsive disorder. Doctor - what is his name again, please? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Dr. Pete Gerhardt. MICHAEL : Dr. Gerhardt? PETER GERHARDT : Yes. MICHAEL : Oh, good. Would you comment on several thing sort of happened in my life that I've written down, how commonplace they are for others with Asperger's syndrome. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Michael, may I interrupt for just a second? MICHAEL : Sure. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I just want to ask you to maybe go to the top two things on your list, just in the interest of time so that we can answer - thanks. MICHAEL : OK. Uncomfortability from very early childhood about touching others in, quote, \"loving,\" unquote ways. Reasons will vary from autistic person to autistic person. Those who have merely state ID cards instead of driver's licenses, which affects the viability to just date, period. Those with Asperger's who live in small towns or especially in rural areas, those with autistic spectrums. Affectability to participate actively in weekly group therapy encounter group for - most likely in large cities or medium-sized university town city... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Michael, I'm going to... MICHAEL : ...hundred miles away. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Michael, I'm going to stop you there. MICHAEL : And just one more, lack of financial knowledge. Any information, any answers he can give, especially parents of children, teenagers, I'll gladly appreciate. Thanks big time. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thanks, Michael, for actually that was a great list. We're coming up to a break, Pete, so maybe you want to take one or two of those points and then we'll go to the break. PETER GERHARDT : OK. Well, you know, I think one of the words that he said, one of the - he said accessibility, and I think that's sort of the key to much of what we're talking about. I mean, it's hard to date if you don't have access to people who you'd like to date. And it's hard to go - he said, it's hard to go on a date if you don't have a car and if you live in a rural area. You know, just being able to access those situations is really critical. And, you know, for anybody like Michael, to be able to then, you know, translate themselves to other people, to explain themselves so they aren't nerds or they aren't geeks or they aren't just weird. That they, you know, they have a neurological difference that results in their acting like this goes a long way to promoting acceptance and accessibility. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I hear in both of our callers so far, a great deal of loneliness, which just hurts. \n\n ###",

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : OK. PETER GERHARDT : Now some of them like to be alone, but many of them are quite lonely. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : When we come back, we're going to have more with Peter Gerhardt and more of your calls. If you have autism or if your child does, what has gone in the way of love, and how have you navigated around it? Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Or send us an email: talk@npr.org. We're going to be back right after a short break. I'm John Donvan. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Right now we are talking about love and autism. And the diagnosis of autism is relatively new. The first known case named in the medical literature, a man named Donald Triplett. He had really good memory and personal - perfect musical pitch, but he had no basic interest in people. He preferred to spin in circles, and he threw crazy, wild tantrums if his parents tried to intervene. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Back then - it was in the 1930s - doctors advised the parents of children with autism to do one thing, and that was to institutionalize them. Donald's parents refused. Times have changed now. These people with this diagnosis along the autism spectrum are integrated into all aspects of society, and they can lead fulfilling lives, with, often, the help of specialists who teach them to read social cues. And that is not something that necessarily comes easily to them. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : If you've been diagnosed with autism or Asperger's, or your child has, we want to ask you, what's gotten in the way of finding love and expressing love and enjoying love? And how have you gotten around it? Tell us your story. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : My guest right now is Peter Gerhardt. He helps adolescents learn the skills that will ease their transitions into adulthood, from how to behave in an elevator to how to navigate in the men's room. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And, Peter, I was just talking about this time before the greater social acceptance of people with autism and people - let's say people with mental disabilities into society, back in the era of institutionalization, which only ended 25 years ago, 30 years ago. Not only were a lot of people, by the tens of the hundreds of thousands in institutions, including many people with autism who were misdiagnosed as having an intellectual disability, not only were they there. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : But on this whole issue of love and sex, society had a very clear position. They did not want it happening. And people were forcibly sterilized to prevent the consequences of love and sex, and the sexes were kept segregated in these institutions. And now we're in a new world. But what about the concerns that motivated some of that: issues of birth control, issues of pregnancy, issues of disease, issues of a naive person being taken advantage of sexually, issues of parenting? Are all those part of what you need to deal with and part of what you're teaching? PETER GERHARDT : Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think today, still, the biggest factor is fear - fear not so much among folks on the spectrum, but fear among those of us who are neurotypical, and some of the issues you brought up about parenting, about disease. PETER GERHARDT : Sexual abuse is a huge issue within the disability community at large, and it's one that the professional community hasn't really addressed and, in many ways, has allowed it to be - continue to be a big secret in the field, the prevalence of sexual abuse. PETER GERHARDT : As individuals get up and - grow up and explore their own feelings and, you know, and then may want to date or be intimate, like without the necessary information to establish a relationship, to understand your body changing, to understand the physical reactions... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : The conversations just aren't happening. PETER GERHARDT : Right, right. It is - it's still, you know, a taboo topic. You know, I've been at meetings where teachers will say, well, when he gets - you know, when he gets a - you know, when he - like when I say, an erection, he gets an erection, and they go, yeah, that's it. And it's - that word is taboo, almost, which drives me crazy. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, going back to some emails from you who are writing into us - and thank you again for your calls - we have an email from Denise Lockett(ph). She's writing this: My husband, we think, is undiagnosed Asperger's. He did not date anyone until we met when he was 28 years old. We met, and I was too kind to interrupt him on our first date, and he talked exclusively about his own interests. And right then I almost said that I would not see him again, but I told myself if he asked a single question about me and my interests, I would give him a chance. Just as the date ended, he did ask why I chose to go to law school. And then she says : Today we have two children and we're happily married. He's gotten much better at communication. Still can't look people in the eye. We have signals at parties and social events when he goes overboard with the talking. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : That sounds like a great adjustment and partnership to me, Pete. I don't know about you. PETER GERHARDT : Yeah. Absolutely. And, you know, I'm - I've met a number of fathers and a couple of mothers who got diagnosed when their son or daughter got diagnosed, which, you know, sort of leads me to believe that there's something admirable about being on the spectrum in terms of relationship. There's something attractive. People are getting - you know, neurotypicals are marrying people on the spectrum, and there's - so you know, there's reliability. There's - most people with Asperger's syndrome tend to be pretty honest. PETER GERHARDT : You know, if your husband says he's going to be home at 5:00, chances are he'll be home at 5:00. I mean, there are desirable traits. I mean, it's - yes, it is, you know, a difference from neurotypicality or a disability, but there are still desirable traits that help to support a relationship. \n\n ###",

I want to bring in Henry in Jacksonville, Florida. Hi, Henry. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. Henry, are you still with us? I guess we lost him. Our apologies to you. Maria is in Charlotte, North Carolina. Maria, hi. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. MARIA : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sure. You're on and we're listening, so you can go ahead... MARIA : Oh, hello. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sure. MARIA : I actually have a son who was diagnosed with Asperger's - mild Asperger's. And based on that, my husband and I, who are both physicians, were also diagnosed (unintelligible) parents with Asperger's. And it's just been such a pleasure to read how much in the literature is out there about Asperger's. My husband and I met in New York City. And our greatest connection was that finally someone got me, and he understood that finally someone understood him. And we really connected very deeply along those lines. Both of us had had just one serious relationship at a time. MARIA : We were never into dating. We were in our mid-30s when we met and got married. We became completely immersed with each other. We're no longer together. Eventually we just couldn't quite navigate the misunderstandings that we had when we were - once we were parents. We're still very friendly, but just craved a deeper emotional connection. And I think it's important that your expert talked about how there's such a deep loneliness. Even in a relationship when you are connected as an Asperger, there's still a deep sense of loneliness because it seems as if you just can't quite connect. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hmm. Pete, do you want to... MARIA : So I think that with my son, who is diagnosed - he is 13 now. And we're both using what we've learned in our marriage and navigating our own Asperger's to kind of make sure that as he navigates dating and relationships and girls that, you know, we keep the conversation going and that he can learn ways to respect his partner and learn ways to respect his own needs and kind of have the ability to say I need some time off. I need to go away. You know, be open to having that back and forth becomes so easily to neurotypicals. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Maria, thanks very much for your call. Pete, do you want to comment on that? PETER GERHARDT : You know, I would comment, but really, when she said, you know, that she and her husband were diagnosed as adults and how that was sort of a relief and, you know, the vast majority of adults that I've worked with who came to their diagnosis later in life as adults were thrilled to get the diagnosis, only because now everything made sense. You know, they weren't lazy. They weren't stupid. They weren't ignorant. They weren't arrogant. They weren't incompetent. They weren't wisecracking. PETER GERHARDT : They had this identified neurological challenge. Now, this is going to get kind of complicated pretty quickly because with the new DSM-5 coming out, you know, we're losing the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. It's all going to be incorporated under autism spectrum disorder. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Just remind everyone briefly what the DSM-5 is going to be. PETER GERHARDT : It's The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders. It's put out by the American Psychiatric Association, and it's the bible for diagnosis. It tells you how to diagnose any number of psychiatric mental health conditions, and autism spectrum disorder is subsumed under that label in this book. So while there are very good clinical reasons for change - for dropping Asperger's syndrome and just having autism spectrum disorder as the label, I think we're going to have a cultural problem because there are people who their culture is identified as having Asperger. And you know, there are support groups. PETER GERHARDT : And, you know, they may call each other Aspes(ph) as opposed to a person with, you know, Asperger's syndrome. And I think that's going to be a challenge for many people going forward, and many new diagnosis, that it isn't sort of a - I can now understand myself because of this separate category. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : A couple more emails. This one is from Eric: I'm from Red Bluff, California. I'm 39 and a half years old. I will be a 40-year-old virgin in September. I dated once, when I was 32. Thankfully, she broke up with me the following Tuesday from a weekend date. Other than that, I have had no love interest where the love was reciprocated. I did not expect to ever find love. I do not believe I could be loved. That is all. This is from Amy in Burnsville, Minnesota : My daughter is 24 years old and has high-functioning autism. She's highly trusting of others, particularly of young men, and does not always accurately predict the behavior of others. This places her at risk for being manipulated into harmful emotional, physical or sexual situations. And because she uses the Internet a lot to talk, in quotes, to people, so she's at risk for Internet predators. It is very stressful for us as parents. She's basically concerned that her daughter is too trusting to be out there. PETER GERHARDT : You know, it really is a big problem, and it's complicated again by the fact that this is an area that professionally we know very little about, about how to teach people to understand this social nuance, how to understand the motivations about how to keep yourself safe, like, you know, simple things. If you go to meet somebody that you met online, like, bring somebody with you or, you know, always have your cellphone with you or, you know, very common sense things. But because the person is on the spectrum, we sometimes tend to not even address it on that level. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right. One more caller. I want to bring in Miranda from Birmingham, Alabama. Hi, Miranda. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. MIRANDA : Hi. Thank you for taking my call. I'm so overjoyed to hear your topic today. I am the mother of a son with Asperger's. He's nine, about to be 10 in a couple of weeks. And as he's reaching adolescence and growing out of being, you know, as he's becoming more - having more social situations, I've been thinking a lot about this topic, love. In particular, will he find love and how will he react to social situations for the rest of his life? He has taken a social skills class that I enrolled him in last year. He has a best friend now, so he's definitely progressing. But as far as affection, I'm definitely finding that interesting because, you know, we laugh - he just walks up - the way he loves on us is he just kind of walks up and lets us hug him. You know, it's all on his own terms. But the topic is just fascinating because I'm a very social, affectionate person, and I've definitely had to tailor that around him. \n\n ###",

I'm John Donvan in Washington. Your doctor tells you that what you have is serious, very serious. And while some of us may simply take in that news and then follow our doctor's advice on what to do, put ourselves into that doctor's hands, many of us choose a different course almost right away, not just to take one doctor's word for it but to exercise a distinct patient privilege: going out to find a second opinion. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Case in point Dawna Harwell, she is a horse trainer and a cancer survivor who joins us now by phone from her home in Collinsville, Texas. Dawna, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. DAWNA HARWELL : Thank you, how are you? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We're good, thank you, and we want to use you as our case history to launch this discussion. So you were told in 2008, not that long ago, that you likely had ovarian cancer. So what happened after you received that news? DAWNA HARWELL : After I received that news, I - they still weren't conclusive on what I had. So I wasn't comfortable with my doctor, so I made an online request to MD Anderson and did a self-referral down there and went down for a second opinion or, actually, a diagnosis, a definite diagnosis. DAWNA HARWELL : At that point, I went back and forth between a couple of departments and was finally decided that I had follicular lymphoma after a surgical biopsy, because none of the other biopsies were conclusive, and none of my other tests were conclusive. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So you were right, that your first doctor was wrong? DAWNA HARWELL : They just didn't have any idea, and it wasn't... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Right or wrong? DAWNA HARWELL : Right or wrong, and they weren't - didn't seem that concerned about it, and yet when it was finally diagnosed, it was a Stage 4 diagnosis. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, one question right away: What gave you that feeling that you needed to go for a second opinion? DAWNA HARWELL : Just because I was being bounced around between doctors. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And what difference, the bottom line, what difference does it make that you made that choice to go looking for another opinion? DAWNA HARWELL : The difference is it probably saved my life, because I wasn't - they made sure to know exactly what I had before I was treated. Even - there's so many different forms of lymphoma that until you know exactly which one you have, I mean, you can be given the wrong process of treatment. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And how are you doing now? DAWNA HARWELL : I'm good. I am in remission and clean and on six-month checkups. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Great news. And finally, what would be your advice to somebody who has that same nagging feeling you do? DAWNA HARWELL : Don't hesitate. I mean, that's - you know, that's what it's all about. Those records are your records, and if, you know, when you're given a, you know, any type of diagnosis that it's, you know, severe like cancer or anything like that, I mean, always go for a second opinion.

We would like to hear from our listeners who have their own experiences with second opinions. Patients: What happened when you asked for a second opinion? And doctors: We want to hear your side of this, too. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org, and you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Later on in our program, one of the most popular crime writers in America, Elmore Leonard, on the return of the show \"Justified.\" But first we're going to continue our conversation on getting a second medical opinion. Laura Landro is the assistant managing editor of the Wall Street Journal, and her piece, \"What if The Doctor is Wrong?,\" ran earlier this week, and she joins us now from Palm Springs, California. Laura, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. LAURA LANDRO : Glad to be here. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So how common is Dawna's story of a second opinion actually uncovering a misdiagnosis or a non-diagnosis in the first place? LAURA LANDRO : Well, you know, it's unfortunately a little more common than you realize. There's all sorts of statistics out there. Diagnostic errors can be, you know, as many as 15 percent of the time, in cancer diagnosis 12 or 13 percent, in some cancers 50 percent if they're very hard to diagnose. LAURA LANDRO : And there are some statistics out there, as well, that say 30 percent of people who sought a second opinion on their own and about 18 percent of those who were required to do so by their insurance company found that there was disagreement. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And what's the process of resolving a disagreement? LAURA LANDRO : Well, that's - you know, sometimes a third opinion is necessary. You know, in fact, Medicare will pay not only 80 percent of the cost of a second opinion when there's a major surgery or procedure, but they will pay for the cost of a third opinion, as well, at the same rate, with the idea that you need to get some kind of consensus. LAURA LANDRO : Now obviously, sooner or later you're just going to have to make a decision, and you could go on getting opinions forever if you could afford it, but there is - when you have a major procedure that's life-altering, life-saving, potentially, you really do, you owe it to yourself, as Dawna said, to get the best advice you can. LAURA LANDRO : And remember that not all doctors are going to agree on everything. Their treatments may differ. Their approach may differ. How aggressive they're going to be may differ. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, I wanted to get to the treatment issue, and you've already gotten to it. I mean, there is not just the issue of what's wrong but there very much could be disagreement and difference of opinions on what to do about it. LAURA LANDRO : Exactly. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : What are some of the classic choices that you've come across in your reporting where somebody had a choice between two difficult or two perhaps confusing options to make? LAURA LANDRO : Well, there are so - you know, prostate cancer is one of the classic examples. You know, there are - there's so much discussion right now when you're diagnosed with prostate cancer. Do you want to take this high-tech, robotic surgery? Do you want to have incontinence and impotence as a possible side effect? Do you want to do watchful waiting? LAURA LANDRO : And a lot of that's going to depend if - there's a wonderful book out now, Jerome Groopman and his wife wrote, called \"Your Medical Mind,\" and it's about trying to discern what your own values are. Are you someone who really wants to just get at the problem right away and be really aggressive, you want to cut that cancer out, you want to go for the surgery? LAURA LANDRO : Or are you more of a less aggressive, let's see if something less invasive works first? And you and your doctor have to sort of work those things out together. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So there is not necessarily a right scientific medical answer on what to do. LAURA LANDRO : Not always, in fact rarely, probably, unless it's like this is a really aggressive cancer, it's going to kill you in two weeks, you'd better get out there and do something about it. (Unintelligible) pointed out earlier. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I want to bring some listeners - excuse me for interrupting - into our conversation. And Kate(ph) is in Pensacola, Florida. Kate, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. KATE : Hi, I had just been diagnosed with cancer and went through a surgery technique and then after that was presented with chemotherapy options and of course radiation following that. The second opinion after considering chemotherapy, was that this - the initial prognosticating index that the first doctor gave, was using data from 1992. And other prognosticating indexes showed that chemotherapy was of no measurable benefit in my case. \n\n ###",

Maybe he's trying to sell you something that, you know, has $5,000 to $55,000 in cost benefit per treatment, like chemo. And then when it comes to radiation, I was presented initially with only one type, which is on rather old machines where they were trying to sell time, had significant damage to peripheral organs such as the lungs and the heart, and wasn't told about 15 other types of radiation that are more up-to-date, more focused, less damaging. KATE : And all this can be learned by personal research on the Net, although it took a tremendous amount of time to find this out. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Yeah, I was going to say, Kate, it sounds like you needed to do an awful lot of work and to have a lot of energy and a lot of push on this yourself. KATE : Yes, and it was disappointing that my doctor didn't want to educate me because he wanted to sort of send me down the mainstream pipeline that's endorsed by, you know, his insurance, indemnification, to send you through chemo and wide-beam radiation. And it is the most profitable of things. So, you know, you have to bear in mind that that may be a motive for some large doctors - some large hospital groups. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Kate, thanks very much for sharing your story. Laura Landro of the Wall Street Journal, is it the case sometimes that doctors themselves will seek a second opinion? And I've heard of cases where they'll put together a team from across several disciplines to try to help them... LAURA LANDRO : Well, that's like a tumor board. If you go to one of these big breast cancer centers, they'll have a tumor board because, you know, the surgeon may want to do surgery, the radiologist may want to do radiation, and they may be able to come up with what's the best thing for this patient. Let's reach a consensus within our organization. LAURA LANDRO : You're also seeing a lot more pathologists within their own institutions will have a second pair of eyes, what they call secondary review, because pathology, it's a little bit of an art, so is radiology. You're looking at images. You're looking at slides, and you're trying to figure out what is that, and things can differ. LAURA LANDRO : We've seen this happen in my family, where things were read one way, and, you know, it was read to be a tumor, and it turned out to be scar tissue. So, you know, with someone more experienced looking at it - and you do have to really hope that within - I think you can count on a lot of doctors, well, they're trying to do the right thing. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Yeah, I don't know if you'll mind doing this, but I know because you alluded to it in your Wall Street Journal piece that you actually had a serious medical condition, and you went for a second opinion. LAURA LANDRO : Oh, yes, and I've written a book about it called \"Survivor.\" Before the TV show, I had the name. But anyway, yes, I was diagnosed with leukemia, now, 20 years ago, CML, and the only - you know, I knew I had to get a bone marrow transplant, but there were three different approaches to the transplants being done at three major cancer centers. LAURA LANDRO : And I really had to study the data and look at the long-term survival rates and look at, you know, what was going to be best for my disease, my condition, my stage of disease at the time that I had it. LAURA LANDRO : And, you know, it was kind of a tough call, but in the end, I went with the center that had the most experience, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and which also had the best long-term disease-free survival for people with my situation. LAURA LANDRO : And it was tough. You know, I had to 3,000 miles away from home, and I was fortunate to have insurance and an employer who allowed me to do that. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : When you say it was tough, do you mean that it was wearing, or do you mean that you had to fight to get this? LAURA LANDRO : Well, you know, it was - you have to remember this was 20 years ago now. I think, you know, people often ask me will doctors get mad. And at the time, I think doctors were not used to - my doctors in New York weren't used to having someone question here's what you're going to do and ask them, you know, come in with note papers and ask them questions and give them statistics that I pulled down off of, you know, medical studies. LAURA LANDRO : They weren't used to that. I think - this was - I'm really dating myself here, but this was before the Internet, and... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Yeah, but you were a reporter, so that helped. LAURA LANDRO : I was a reporter, and I was a little bit at - obviously at a big advantage for that, and I had a lot of friends who were scientists, and I pulled together a team of people who really helped. And you can do that as an individual, as well. LAURA LANDRO : But I really had to make a decision that was a tough one, because it meant leaving where I had started, you know, down the process, and it also meant again going 3,000 miles from home. And - but it was very much a decision, it was also based on a feeling about the doctors, a feeling about the hospital, a feeling about - that they cared, you know, a little bit - you get a little into, not just the diagnostics, but how do I feel about the treatment (unintelligible) people. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We're hearing that same note from Dawna, that it's a feeling that you get.

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We're talking about medical second opinions, when to get one, how to ask, and up next we're going to be talking with a doctor about the doctor's side of second opinions and when it may not make sense to get one. Patients, tell us : What happened to you when you asked for a second opinion? And doctors, we do want to hear your side, too. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. I'm John Donvan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm John Donvan. Most of the time, when we go to the doctor's office with a problem, we get a diagnosis: a sinus infection maybe or a sprained ankle. And then we follow the doctor's advice. End of story. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sometimes, though, there is much more at stake, and patients will go looking for a second opinion. One recent study of cancer cases showed that about nine percent of original diagnoses were later changed as the result of the patient getting a second opinion. So patients, we want to know from you : What happened when you asked for a second opinion? And doctors, we'd like to hear your side of this as well. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org, and you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. So patients, we want to know from you : So we're taking your calls, and we want to now speak with Ryan(ph) in Denver, Colorado. Ryan, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. RYAN : Hi, this is Ryan. I think that my comment would be that whenever a patient feels uncomfortable or uncertain about their physician or the diagnosis, I really recommend that they get a second opinion. I think that patients need to feel very confident and trusting in their physician, and if there's any equivocation, and certainly if it's grave or life-threatening, then I like for them to have that second opinion. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Are you speaking to us as a doctor? RYAN : I am. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Oh, OK. RYAN : I'm a younger physician, and you know, I think that it's important that the patients really trust in the relationship that they have before you embark on any particularly aggressive treatment plan. The other thing that I would suggest to patients is that if they feel the need for a second opinion, I really do think that they should discuss that with their primary doctor, and oftentimes, you know, I can try and help facilitate that. RYAN : I can provide them all of the records that we have so far, the tests that we've done, and you know, maybe suggest that, oh, this research center really specializes in what we think you have, and that might be a good place for you to start looking... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right, thanks very much, Ryan, I appreciate your call. I want to bring now into the conversation Dr. Leonard Lichtenfeld. He is the deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, and he joins us from the studios at their offices in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Lichtenfeld, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : Thank you, John, pleasure to be with you. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So we've heard and just heard from a doctor and from several patients who have been talking about their experiences in seeking second opinions. I have a few questions, and one of them is actually put - I was going to put to you, but it comes in the form of an email. Del(ph) from Florida puts it this way, and it's very blunt. He says: Doesn't asking a second opinion insult the doctor? How could it not? You're saying that you don't trust his opinion. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And I would assume that maybe that inhibition exists in a lot of patients, that they feel they're going to make an enemy of the doctor if they say I want to go somewhere else for more advice. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : Well, when you have a life-threatening condition, such as cancer, it's your life, it's your decision, and if the doctor gets insulted, maybe it's time to get another doctor. I think that many physicians will understand that when you get into a complicated medical circumstance, that having another set of eyes and ears, so to speak, to go over things is not a bad idea. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : And I think that many physicians that I know will actually encourage people if they have a question to seek a second opinion. So if your doctor is going to be insulted, let your doctor be insulted; it's your life, take charge, do what you need to do to make yourself comfortable. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : How does it work among you, though, as colleagues if you were to give a second opinion that essentially, let's say, corrects or updates or turns out in the end to be better than your colleague's? Does that put your colleague in a bad light? You know, say it happens more than once or twice or three times. \n\n ###",

Understand, as was mentioned earlier in the prior segment, medicine, there's a lot of art to medicine, as well as science. So not everything is as clear-cut, and different people have different approaches. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : And as Ryan just mentioned, sometimes you may have a better comfort level with one doctor versus another, and that's a very important consideration. I can't emphasize that enough. So you know, I will say I've seen situations, and I think something to be cautious about, I've seen situations where someone who \u2013 a surgical opinion, asks for another opinion, and they gave them somebody else in the same group; that got a little testy because I don't think the second doctor necessarily wanted to overrule the first doctor. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : They know each other, work with each other every day in the same hospital, same - essentially the same practice. But you know, again, it comes down to the bottom line: Life-threatening conditions, serious conditions. If you have the option and opportunity and the time to get the second opinion, and you feel that you would feel better from having that opinion, do it and not hesitate. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And is there any etiquette to this that we need to know about? LEONARD LICHTENFELD : I don't know that there's an etiquette. Ryan also made another excellent point. Hopefully you have someone who's your primary source of care. Unfortunately, not everyone has that these days, but a primary care family physician, a primary care internist, can be a critical ally in helping you get through that process. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : The etiquette simply is once you've made the arrangement, the decision to do that, is to say to your doctor this is something I want to do, and this is not necessarily a reflection on you personally, but this is important for me and my family, and just make that doctor aware that you're pursuing that second opinion. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Jim from Rochester, New York, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. JIM : Yes, I have been complaining for a year, a year and a half to my primary physician about a coughing and clearing my throat and phlegm situation. And finally I bugged him enough where he sent me to a throat doctor. And the throat doctor concluded that I had laryngeal, pharyngeal acid reflux and to see him in a couple of months and take a couple of pills that he said and a diet. JIM : I somehow just couldn't buy that. So I had an upcoming appointment with - for a colonoscopy. So I decided to go in to see my doctor that was going to do the colonoscopy, because he is a little familiar with that area, he comes - I guess he's from the throat down, and he considered doing an endoscope, an endoscopy, which we had done, and he spotted something and said I should go to a throat doctor. JIM : And I said I just got through two weeks ago, and he said, well, it may be a tumor, and the long story short, I went back, and in effect they did find that it was a throat cancer, actually a tumor on my tongue. And Stage 2, and then I did my seven weeks of radiation. JIM : But my point is that I was basically misdiagnosed. I was a self-advocate and moved on and asked another doctor and got the right answer. It was... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I'm curious, Jim, you're the third caller to mention that something bothered me, something didn't feel right with me. And I want to ask Dr. Lichtenfeld, the lesson seems to be to listen to your instincts on this. JIM : I have a comment later on that one. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sure, stay on with us, Jim. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : I don't think there's any question that we know our bodies better than anyone else. And when something is amiss, and you're not comfortable with the answers you're getting, it is perfectly appropriate to seek that other opinion. Now, there comes a time when you say the repetitive opinion-seeking might not be appropriate or productive. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : But it comes down to the fact that we know ourselves better than anyone else does, and I think we always have to keep that in mind. And the other point I would make is that in our medical system today, unfortunately, it's becoming a lot more fragmented, and that means more of us going forward are going to have to be responsible for our own health, be our own advocates and take charge and take responsibility of how we live, what we do and how we obtain our medical care and how we engage in seeking that care. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Jim, you wanted to add something else? JIM : Yes, yes, and amen to that, and my radiology oncologist told me that - she said I always listen to my patients because invariably they are correct. And my type of cancer, by the way, which is a very important situation I would like to get out there, was caused by HPV virus, human papillomavirus, which is similar to what Michael Douglas the actor has. JIM : And I think that I was getting not the runaround, but I wasn't getting the attention because I'm a non-drinker, non-smoker, and this was caused by a virus, which...

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Jim, I'm sorry to jump in. I just want to see how your experience compares to our next caller's, and thanks very much for your call. JIM : Thank you. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thank you. I want to bring in Marjorie(ph) from Charlottesville, Virginia. Hi, Marjorie, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. MARJORIE : Oh, well, hi. I'm not a patient. I just wanted to make - this great discussion, I wanted to make the comment that I've been in the health care industry for about 40 years, watching development and changes. And we're - you know, we've gone from a system that was very paternalistic, where the patient really had no, not many rights and not much responsibility, to a system where we are trying to become more consumer - more of a consumer. MARJORIE : And so we have not only rights but responsibilities as patients to educate ourselves, to follow our instincts, and there's just really in this day and age, with online resources, there is just no excuse for not being able to access journals and educating yourself as intensely and deeply as you can about any diagnosis you get, not just getting a second opinion, which is, you know, essential sometimes, but also having - being armed with knowledge so that you... MARJORIE : You know, because there - I see instances with patients who, because they dove into something, they really became an expert in their particular diagnosis. I mean, they knew as much, if not more than their particular physician. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Marjorie, I hear you on that, and I thank you for your call. But I do want to put the other side of that to Dr. Lichtenfeld, which is the - we are talking about people coming in and asking for second opinions, seeking second opinions when we're talking about complicated cases such as cancer and complicated treatments. Prior to your being an oncologist, you did primary care, did you not? LEONARD LICHTENFELD : I have been a primary care internist at one point in my career. Yes. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So at that level, you might be dealing with aches and pains and sore throats, and let's say something like a chronic nerve problem, somebody has sciatica. And you know what they need to do for sciatica, which is, essentially, is to, I think, in most cases, to ride it out, maybe with some painkillers. But there's not a great deal to be done. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : A patient who comes in seeking a second or a third or a fourth opinion because they're frustrated by the pain, or a patient who comes in with something discovered off of the Internet because of that kind of research that Marjorie's talking about, and that kind of energy and devotion, would that sort of patient not drive you crazy after a while? LEONARD LICHTENFELD : The patient is - partnership is the best way to approach medical care. So I will never say to somebody, don't go to the Internet. I will say at some point, you have to have trust in the people who are caring for you, because they are - hopefully, have your best interests at heart. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : But I think what happens sometimes is that there's a lot of information on the Internet. In fact, I wrote an editorial recently on the topic, calling it basically the Wild - similar to the Wild West. It's untamed. And so there's quality information on the Internet, and there's information on the Internet that's not quality. And it's sometimes very hard to tell the difference. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : And you can see someone - for example, the back pain that you're mentioning. People will seek the answer, the right answer, which is sometimes - for many patients, don't do anything particularly different. Call me if there's a particular change in your condition. They don't accept that and they want something else, and eventually they may end up in certain treatments. They may end up in surgery. LEONARD LICHTENFELD : When they - the benefit, shall we say, for the risk, is not worthwhile. And we know that. Now, that doesn't mean back surgery's bad, but it means that some patients may drive the process to the point where something gets done to them by someone that is not really in the patient's best interest. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We're talking about the issue of second opinions. Our guest right now is Dr. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for - chief - deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. And we're taking your stories of seeking second opinions on medical procedures and medical diagnoses. And I want to bring in Brian in Portland, Oregon. Brian, hi. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. BRIAN : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Yeah. I just wanted to talk about how it seems that doctors are very well-trained at doing, like, emergency room diagnoses where they can diagnose within 17 seconds, which I believe is an actual statistic. But when it comes to a more complicated case, they seem very flummoxed. And I don't think doctors have any training in trying to figure out a more complex case. And I just - I wonder if there's any movement to train doctors better in that way, because it seems if they come up with a first diagnosis in 17 seconds, and if that's wrong, then they have no idea. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hmm. Dr. Lichtenfeld? LEONARD LICHTENFELD : Well, I can't speak to making a diagnosis in 17 seconds, and I would go back to a comment that was made earlier. Sometimes - not sometimes. I felt all the time, you had to really listen to what the patients had to say, because if you listen carefully, you might get a clue as to what's going on. \n\n ###",

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand. MADELEINE BRAND, host : We just talked about the high price of oil. More than 130 dollars a barrel so, some owners of SUVs, well, they are having second thoughts. They are trying to get rid of them. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Right. Well, good luck with that. It's tough to unload a gas guzzler these days because there is a glut on the market, too few buyers. From Seattle, NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports. WENDY KAUFMAN : Two years ago Ian Vanrinen (ph) bought a used mid-sized SUV. He wanted the power of a V8 engine to pull his boat, but now he wants to swap his SUV for something smaller, and more fuel efficient. Mr. IAN VANRINEN : And here we are at my Lincoln Aviator. I'm hopping in, and closing the door. WENDY KAUFMAN : Vanrinen has been trying to sell his sport utility for weeks. It looks practically brand new, and has lots of bells and whistles. In the beginning, he says, there was a fair amount of interest, but not anymore. Mr. IAN VANRINEN : It's kind of a neat car for the right person, it's the perfect car. For everybody else, it's still a gas guzzling SUV. WENDY KAUFMAN : Beyond the price of gasoline and concern for the environment, the housing slump has meant that many construction workers are no longer buying SUVs and pick-ups. What's more, there's a trend toward so-called crossover vehicles which offer SUV features, but on a cart chassis with better gas mileage. Vanrinen considered using his SUV as a trade in, and went to a couple of dealers. What he heard wasn't encouraging. Mr. IAN VANRINEN : They all pretty much told me that right now, the SUV market the way it is, the trade in value that they are going to be able to give me is probably going to be, you know, 5,000 dollars less than maybe what I want to get out of the car. And so, if I do choose to trade it in, just to get out of this situation, I'm probably looking at a 5,000 dollars hit. WENDY KAUFMAN : In other words, he would get 5,000 dollars less then he owes on the vehicle. In automobile loan parlance, it's called an upside down loan. Mr. MIKE LEVINE (General Manager, Honda Auto Center) : It's no different really than subprime thing with the homes. When the land values drop, it puts people in a negative equity position, and with a car, it's the same exact thing. WENDY KAUFMAN : That's Mike Levine, General Manager of the Honda Auto Center in Bellevue, Washington, one of the largest Honda dealers in the Pacific North West. He says that in the past 90 days, the number of customers with negative equity in their SUVs has shot up remarkably. The result of a kind of chain reaction. Mr. MIKE LEVINE (General Manager, Honda Auto Center) : We saw a used car market change dramatically where customers just weren't buying that higher-end used vehicle nearly as much. And real quick, what that did was back up all the dealers with inventory. The dealers stopped buying the inventory. The values dropped and, in kind of a free fall. WENDY KAUFMAN : He adds, it's hard to look a customer in the eye, and tell him that although he owes 26,000 dollars, the dealership can offer only 14,000 on a trade-in because that's all it can sell it for in the current climate. According to CNW Marketing Research, nationwide in the month of April, the average used SUV took more than 66 days to sell, versus 48 days a year ago. Tom Webb, Chief Economist at Mannheim Corporation, which operates the nation's largest wholesale auctions of used cars, says he doesn't think the SUV market has hit bottom. Mr. TOM WEBB (Chief Economist, Mannheim Corporation) : It looks like in April, in terms of the SUVs, that the prices were starting to bottom out, that the market was starting to clear. But so far, in the first ten days of May, it wasn't good. WENDY KAUFMAN : Prices for full-sized SUV's were still going down, meanwhile prices for compacts, were up. In the current environment, those who want to buy a used sport utility may be in luck. Stanley Ng of Toyota of Bellevue, points to the large collection of used SUVs on the lot, Lexus, Jeep Cherokees, Ford Explorers, and just about everything else. Mr. STANLEY NG (Sales, Toyota of Bellevue) : Right now, if you were a motivated buyer for a SUV, I think the management will do whatever it takes to sell you a car. You know, it's definitely buyer's market. WENDY KAUFMAN : On the other hand, if you are interested in a fuel efficient Toyota Prius, you may not find one here, and if you want to buy a new Prius, you may have to put your name on a waiting list. WENDY KAUFMAN : Wendy Kaufman, NPR News, Seattle. \n\n ###",

He writes crime, and he has turned a lifetime of novels, short stories and movie scripts that sold and got read and seen and that built a following - six decades worth of that, time enough for him to figure out what works on the page, which often turns out to be what works quite well on the screen, as well. The acclaimed TV series on FX, \"Justified,\" is based on one of Leonard's short stories \"Fire in the Hole.\" Seasons one and two captured attention and garnered awards for the show's gritty, yet likeable characters and their Kentucky drawl. Season three premiered this week. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : If you have followed Elmore Leonard's works in television or in crime novels, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989(ph). Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can join our conversation at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. And any writers out there who want to talk to a writer's writer, here is your chance. Elmore Leonard joins us now from studios of member station WDET in Detroit. Welcome to the show, Elmore Leonard. ELMORE LEONARD : Thank you. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So you have this series now, you and a group of colleagues, fellow executive producers. It is based, as I said, on your story \"Fire in the Hole.\" It's doing fabulously well, critically acclaimed. And it's - the interesting thing is your title on the credits is executive producer. So how - what happens when a writer becomes an executive producer? ELMORE LEONARD : Well, what happens to me is I feel I should take part in it. I feel I can't just sit along and watch the sequences and not do anything about it, that I should provide something, because I've - all my life, I've written for paychecks. So I'm doing the same thing now, although I don't get involved with the day-to-day work of the writing team, because there are about seven or eight in there. I've never written with anyone else before. So I just write my own book, which I've done now with \"Raylan.\" So \"Raylan\" runs for a book length. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : That's your new book. ELMORE LEONARD : And in it - the new book that's coming out today or tomorrow. And it's - and in it are sequences that they can use or not use. But I don't want to know what they're doing, and so I don't want to interfere with their work. So that - I write these about Raylan and about the kind of characters that he is confronted with, and I'm happy about it. And they get to use what they want. But I can't - I just cannot see myself sitting and not working if I'm getting paid. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Our number is - what great work ethic. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, and our email address is talk@npr.org. I'm quite interested, Elmore, in the matter of watching your - a story that you conceived of live and grow beyond the covers of the book that you wrote that might have inspired the film. You wrote the book for - that became the film \"Get Shorty.\" You wrote \"Rum Punch,\" which became Quentin Tarantino's \"Jackie Brown.\" It's happened a number of times. Your books have inspired stories. And now with this hit show on the FX channel, \"Justified,\" I find it fascinating that the pilot is based very much on your short story \"Fire in the Hole,\" but it then lives on for years and years afterward. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So I'd like to just listen to - a little bit of a spoiler alert for those who haven't seen the pilot, but it was two seasons back - the closing scene in which two characters, your main character, Raylan Givens, who's your hero and the main character of your new book \"Raylan.\" Raylan Givens is in a shootout with a Boyd Crowder. And I just need to explain it, because we all know the obvious. Raylan wins the shootout. Let's listen to that. WALTER GOGGINS : (as Boyd Crowder) What are you packing? TIMOTHY OLYPHANT : (as Raylan Givens) You'll pay to find that out. WALTER GOGGINS : (as Boyd Crowder) Oh, you got ice cold water run through your veins. Well, should we just do us a shot of Jim Beam, just for old time's sake? AARON : (as Boyd Crowder) Oh, you did it, huh? You really did. You did it. TIMOTHY OLYPHANT : (as Raylan Givens) I'm sorry. You called it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, what happens there is Raylan and Boyd are still talking, and on television Boyd lives. In your short story, that same shootout happens and then Raylan is asked, is he dead? And you say - and Raylan answers, well, he is now. In the short story, he dies and so... ELMORE LEONARD : In the first - and in the shooting he died. Then they said, wait a minute, this guy is so good, let's - we got to keep him alive because I was disappointed when Boyd Crowder died. I said, he's too good to lose, and they all felt the same way. So they worked a little different, re-shot the scene, I guess. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And I guess my basic question is, are you good with - are you OK with that to see this guy live? ELMORE LEONARD : That's the best thing that's happened to this show... ELMORE LEONARD : ...because Boyd's great. He's the perfect counterpart for Raylan. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We have a lot of your fans who are lined up on our phone lines waiting to talk with you. Let's bring in Aaron from Fort Dodge, Iowa. Aaron, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. \n\n ###",

ELMORE LEONARD : Hi there. AARON : Yeah. No, I just wanted to say, first off, thanks to Elmore Leonard. I recently have gotten into the genre of Westerns. And in my attempt to get into the genre, I kind of dipped into short stories, and I ran across a couple of collections of his short stories, and I really gravitated to him. I kind of liked him quite a bit, and I just - I guess my question, just to get to the point then is could you tell us - could Mr. Leonard tell us about his early years writing those short stories, the kind of pulp fiction-y Western tales. And, you know, with that, you know, the days of living hand to mouth, and kind of learning to be a writer for, you know, literally to put food on the table and a roof over the head. Or was this, you know, what was that evolution as a writer like? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : How'd you do it? ELMORE LEONARD : Well, I decided to write Westerns because there was a terrific market for Westerns in the '50s. There were a lot of pulp magazines, like Dime Western and 10 Story Western that were still being published. The better ones paid two cents a word. And I thought I like Westerns. I didn't read them, but I loved Western movies, so I decided I'm going to get in on this. So I was working at an ad agency, but I'd get up in the morning at 5 o'clock and I'd write - it took me a couple of months to get up. But I would write for two hours and I would write two pages. ELMORE LEONARD : At that time, I could write a page an hour - not anymore. But - so I would - at that time, during the '50s, I wrote 30 short stories and sold them and five books, and a couple were made in the movies. So I was on my way. But a lot of them, though, were just for two cents a word, and - but at least in the '50s, that was - that's $100. So at least it was worthwhile in the '50s. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Aaron, thanks for your call. I want to bring in Sirley(ph) from Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Sirley, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. SIRLEY : Oh, Elmore, you are my very favorite. And they suggested that I mention two particularly hilarious polluter sketches from your Florida series. The polluter who - two elderly couples staying in a motel, he leaves the motel gets eaten by an alligator, or - yeah, alligator. And the other one is the polluter who got a dump truck full of trash dumped into his convertible. ELMORE LEONARD : Yeah, I remember them. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You're punishing polluters. ELMORE LEONARD : So I did - no, they - well, they weren't. I don't think they were called polluters in the story. No, but an - you got to put an alligator in the story if you're setting it in Florida. And this guy who was somebody - what was paid to get him out of the way, and they - I think what they did was just dump a lot of cement into his convertible, and he was still in it. SIRLEY : And then the trek out into the wilderness with that renegade, I think he was one-eyed, lived in a hovel, and they called him the king, or the emperor, or the prince. ELMORE LEONARD : I don't remember that. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right. Sirley, thanks for your call. And you're inspiring me to go back to these Florida stories. SIRLEY : (Unintelligible). JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thanks for your call. I want to talk to you, very briefly, about your famous 10 rules for writing. I'm not sure how far back those were published, but... ELMORE LEONARD : 2000. Year of 2000. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : 2000. They've lived on forever. You have 10 very practical rules, literally for - I think, you intend them fully for people who want to write and who want to have success, and they are... ELMORE LEONARD : I didn't do them very seriously, the one I gave them at a writer's conference. And that afternoon, I wrote the 10 rules and I recited them at the end of my talk. And then I came off the stage and someone is - and I was holding this sheet of paper with the 10 rules written in longhand. And someone came out to me and said, could I have those? I said, yeah and I gave them to him. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, they're taken very seriously and it may not be back. \n\n ###",

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Let's bring in somebody, I think, might be an aspiring writer, Charles in St. Augustine, Florida. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. CHARLES : Oh, thank you for taking my call. Mr. Leonard, I was wondering in your writing process, when you're writing something for the page or for the screen, what is the point that you usually begin from? And I'll take my answer off the air. ELMORE LEONARD : Hmm. I don't - I'm not sure what you mean. When I begin to write, how do I start? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, I think he was intending to ask, do you have the idea - do you have the ending in mind when you sit down with the beginning, or do you start from the beginning and figure it out from there? ELMORE LEONARD : No, I have no idea where it's going to go. I don't want to know, because the idea is accumulated in the four months, five months, six months. Now, it's get - it takes me longer - of the writing process, you get more - you get better ideas while you're writing it, that ideas come to you, that scenes come to you that then if you were to sit down and begin to list scenes. So I don't - I started out that way years and years ago, but I only did about two books that I outlined. ELMORE LEONARD : And now, I just started writing a book. I have characters in mind to open with. Now, I think that the first 100 pages you're introducing characters that are interested to you, the writer. See how they get along. See if there's - what the conflicts are. And then get them going in the second part - in the act two, and get the, you know, get some subplots going, and then get into a point where you have to finish and then think of the ending. And there are - normally there are other ways. There are more - there's more than one way to finish a book, more than one conclusion you can reach. And that's what - that's just the way you do it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right. ELMORE LEONARD : You come to an end and you end it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We are talking with Elmore Leonard. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION. I want to bring in Juan from Fort Myers, Florida. Juan, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. JUAN : Yes, thank you. I think you've answered some of my questions, but I have another one. The - in writing, it's important to keep a sequence, or a storyline, you call... And but also, I think is just as important or maybe more important, is how you develop your story and your phrases. What - is there anything that you can tell us about developing and, you know, as part of the art of writing as how you, say, think. And like I know that you notice that some of the words that you said not to use, they're old words and that, kind of, you know, they're not stimulating. So how would you stimulate? What do you use and what do you recommend to stimulate the writing? \n\n ###",

Thanks to brainy superstars like Mark Zuckerberg and, before him, Bill Gates, it's probably cooler now than it's ever been to be smart, to know stuff. Before them, you were taking something of a risk to be a teen who seemed to be too smart, but there was always one safe place: a TV show called \"It's Academic,\" which started in Washington, D.C., and then was reproduced in several American cities, a show that starred smart American high school students competing against each other to show just how smart they were. Arguably the world today is a safer place than it used to be for one category of American : The questions were difficult. The time before the buzzer was short. And the honor of winning was large and enduring. Mac McGarry hosted the very first episode when the show launched. And having asked over the decades thousands of questions and knowing the answers in advance, just imagine what he knows now and the stories he can tell. But we want to hear your stories, too. Were you one of the thousands who made the cut and had a seat on \"It's Academic\" or one of other many high school quiz shows around the country? Call us and we want to know what was the answer that stumped you or how did you win.

Mac McGarry joins us now from his home in Potomac, Maryland. Welcome to the program, Mac. How are you? MAC MCGARRY : Thank you very much, John. And what a special pleasure to meet a fellow alumnus of one of America's greatest high schools, Regis, on East 84th Street in Manhattan. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : It... MAC MCGARRY : I'm only a few decades ahead of you, John... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : It's... MAC MCGARRY : ...but it's still a pleasure. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : It's true. We both attended Regis High School. And where I had the advantage was that in my time there was a show called \"It's Academic,\" and I remember going to the taping, to the New York version when Regis competed. And I was a freshman, so I wasn't eligible for the team but our - we put some seniors on the team. Tragically, they did not win for me that day, but it was a great memory. MAC MCGARRY : I can't believe that, John. C'est impossible. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So... MAC MCGARRY : ...that Regis didn't win. Yes, I remember when New York started its version of the show, about two years after Washington. The host was the late Art James. He came down to see how it was done in Washington and brought it all back to New York. And we've been all over the country - New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Boston, Cleveland... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Wow. MAC MCGARRY : ...Pittsburgh. Now, we're still in Baltimore and Cleveland, at least last time I looked. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Mac, what do you think made the show so enduring? MAC MCGARRY : One of the things, John, is the combination of the acclaim that sports stars get with the kind of attention that serious scholars should get, but what I mean by this is that after about two years of the show, it just sort of stood there flat. And then, Susan Altman, one of the producers, said let's bring in the cheerleaders and the bands. And as soon as we did that, it really started to take off. It was a tribute to the scholarship of the young contestants that it had all the trappings of a football game. And so I think that was very important in our gradual growth over the years. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So it was not you would say a televisually exciting show in the beginning? MAC MCGARRY : Not in the beginning I don't think. People could have accused us of being geeks or nerds just sort of sitting there... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : No. No. MAC MCGARRY : ...and responding as best we could. \n\n ###",

MAC MCGARRY : Yes, that's true. She was - I don't remember her especially, but I can give you the year. It was the early '80s. I'm sure she wouldn't mind.

It's an honor to speak to you again. It's been about 12 years since I appeared on the show. And I know my younger brothers and I were all on the \"It's Academic\" team at Hayfield Secondary School in Fairfax County. And it was a lot of fun even though every year until probably my youngest brother's year, we always lost. We got killed on the show. We weren't pressing the buzzer, but... MAC MCGARRY : What do you do now, Bryan? What do you do now? BRYAN : I'm finishing up my master's degree in engineering. And right after high school, I went to the University of Virginia and joined the Peace Corps and - but all throughout the whole time I always kept up with trivia stuff, playing Trivial Pursuit and all that with my friends. And I think... MAC MCGARRY : Sophie Altman - pardon me, Bryan. Sophie Altman, the founder of the show always said this, facts are not trivia... MAC MCGARRY : ...so facts. That's good for you. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thanks, Bryan, very much for your call. I'd be very interested to hear from somebody who won because I haven't met anybody yet who was actually a winner, and I know they existed. Today, I exchanged emails with my colleague George Stephanopoulos over at ABC, who was a contestant, I believe, in the New York version. And he said it was one of the greatest memories of his life. MAC MCGARRY : Actually, he was in... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Where was he? MAC MCGARRY : He was in Cleveland. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I'm sorry. And he said it was one of the greatest memories of his life, except for the fact that he didn't win, which was frustrating. Yeah. I want to bring in Hillary(ph) in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Hi, Hillary. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. HILLARY : Hi. Hi. It's so great to hear Mac McGarry's voice after all these years. I was captain of Magruder High School's \"It's Academic\" team from 1984 and 1985, and we did win. We won in the first round, which was very exciting. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Aha. OK. HILLARY : But we lost in the second round to, like, Georgetown Prep in Sidwell Friends or something like that. We were just a country bumpkin school. So getting passed the first round was a really big deal for us. \n\n ###",

JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Wow. MAC MCGARRY : 50 years. Can you imagine that? People keep telling me, you did the show for 50 years. I said, I don't believe it. I just got started. 1961, John F. Kennedy was president. And I can tell you that this theory of Camelot was true. All the young people in Washington thought it was great to have a young president, his beautiful, young wife and there was a great atmosphere in Washington in the years when we first started. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Did that interact with what was happening on the show? MAC MCGARRY : I think - what I remember about the early days of the show was how well-dressed each of the students was. The girls would have necklaces on and nice dresses. The guys always would have shirts - shirts, I hope - coat and tie on. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I knew what you meant. MAC MCGARRY : And as we went through the Vietnam era, there was a restlessness that was palpable in the audience. The unruly sections of the audience would takeover for a little while, then they'd stop. And now, even though we've been through these \u2013 and are still in some terrible wars - things fairly calm on \"It's Academic\"... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Interesting. MAC MCGARRY : ...among the contestants. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Sociology of their own... MAC MCGARRY : They zeroed in on winning the game. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Nancy(ph) in Monroe, Wisconsin, welcome. You're on TALK OF THE NATION. NANCY : Hi. How are you? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Good. Good. NANCY : Good. My experience was with the St. Louis version of this called \"Scholar Quiz\" and it would have been either in the fall of '70 or the winter of - or the spring of '71. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Mm-hmm. NANCY : But the question - I was the captain of our team and we were leading throughout the entire show, but we couldn't see the score. And I thought we were trailing, and so I kind of desperately answered the last - we could see the timer. I desperately answered the last question, which was, how many teaspoons in a tablespoon? And I blew it and we lost. NANCY : But if I just kept my mouth shut - a lesson I still haven't really learned - if I had just kept my mouth shut, we would have won. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : What's the answer? NANCY : Three. What did I say? I said two. \n\n ###",

Ooh, that's now closed, kind of Mike Tyson's old neighborhood, not a very savory neighborhood even back in the '60s. But what I remember, two vivid memories - one is of my teammates, one who became a physicist and another who became a neurosurgeon. And the other thing was I came from a high school with many, many accomplished athletes, several of whom became really important pro athletes, and yet in our yearbook, the centerfolds, if you will, of our yearbook contained a picture of these three nerdy guys on \"It's Academic,\" including me. It was a thrill. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : That is a thrill. That's even thrilling to hear. Congratulations to you. HOWARD : Thank you so much. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I just hope you didn't get beaten up on the way home from school the way that those... HOWARD : I got beaten up almost every day at school. MAC MCGARRY : That's the best thing I've heard in quite a while: centerfold for \"Its Academic\" stars. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You showed them, Howard. All right. Thanks very much for your call. I want to bring in Brian(ph) in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. BRIAN : Hello. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hi, Brian. I mispronounced the name of your town, if you can correct me. BRIAN : Oh, Murfreesboro. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I got it right. BRIAN : OK. That's right. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Great. What's your story? BRIAN : I was on a similar show in Atlanta, growing up in high school in the early '90s. And we were also on another show in Macon, Georgia, our team. And we came then as runner's up on the Atlanta show, which is called \"High Q\" out of WSB in Atlanta and then - and we actually won the show, won the season on the show in Macon, so... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : What was your high school? BRIAN : It was a lot of - it was Griffin High School in Griffin, Georgia. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And do you remember the questions that really got you? BRIAN : We had four people on our team, and everybody kind of had a specialty that - it was almost like we would defer to each member if one of the subject areas came up. One area that I almost never pursued, but just because of the time constraints and that my brain works slowly sometimes, was any kind of math question or something that would require calculation. I would just look to one of my other teammates because I could trust them to get it, and then I would handle any of the other subjects, but general knowledge kinds of things and sports especially seemed to be my specialty. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Brian, thanks so much for your call. Mac, we're coming up to the end of the session here. And I just - I know that you're stepping down now after more than 50 years. What are you going to miss most? MAC MCGARRY : Grand delusion as I call it, John. Because every time I would look up and see the panel of students, they were always 17 years old. I would be deluded into thinking that I'm not getting any older at all. My kids are always the same age, and here I am 85. Wow. \n\n ###",

I'm John Donvan in Washington. Neal Conan is away. Not all capitalists are Republicans, but all Republicans are capitalists, as a rule, anyway, straightforward enough. But then came the current race for the White House, Republican versus Republican, and now we're hearing there are all different kinds of capitalists. Not unsuccessful/successful, but good guy/bad guy, with fellow Republicans attacking frontrunner Mitt Romney, who made his money as a venture capitalist by calling him a vulture capitalist, a job destroyer, a crony capitalist. NEWT GINGRICH : But if somebody who is very wealthy comes in, takes over your company, takes out all the cash and leaves behind the unemployment, I think that's not a model we want to advocate. SARAH PALIN : Governor Romney has claimed to have created 100,000 jobs at Bain, and, you know, people are wanting to know: Is there proof of that claim? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Newt Gingrich on Fox News and Sarah Palin speaking on \"Hannity.\" The charges center on his work at Bain Capital, the firm he co-founded before he went into politics. In a moment, NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax will join us to tell us what this all means and to explain how venture capital firms actually work. But first we want to ask you : If a private firm took over your company using borrowed money, in the end was your company better off, or was it worse off? Tell us your story. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can also join the conversation, also at our website. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. But first we want to ask you : Later on in the program, Mac McGarry, longtime host of \"It's Academic,\" will join us. But first Marilyn Geewax, and her piece called \"So, Um, What is a Private Equity Firm\" was posted today at npr.org. Welcome back, Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Hi. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Hi, and in all of these terms that we're hearing thrown about in the Republican debates by - especially by the now-departed Rick Perry, walk us through it. What is private equity? What is venture capital? And what do they mean by vulture capital? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Well, let's just take a minute to stop and think about the very big picture here. What we're talking about is there are people and institutions - institutions are things like pension funds and university endowments - these wealthy people and institutions need to invest their money. They're not going to just stuff it in a mattress or take it to the bank where they get very little interest. They need to grow their money. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : They can grow it in two different ways. They could go to a public forum like the New York Stock Exchange and buy publicly traded stocks, or they can do it in a private way. And that's where these private equity firms come in, that's what Bain Capital was. It takes a bunch of money, puts it all together and then invests it in companies to hope that they will grow. And they're looking for quick growth. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : I was going to ask, for them, the advantage of going private rather than going public is what? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Well, there are better opportunities sometimes. You know, not every company trades on the New York Stock Exchange. You look around America, I'm sure in any community you'll find middle-market companies that are not really huge, but they're not small. They're good, ongoing companies. And to be able to invest in those, you need to go through these private markets. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And these private equity firms help our - they're kind of matchmakers. They put together the people with the pools of money and the companies that want to get access to that equity. So there are different strategies that these private equity firms can use. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : One strategy can be called venture capital, and that is they're capitalists. Capital means money. And they look for a good venture, and they put their capital into that venture, and it grows. Now, a great example of that would be Google. Back in the '90s, there were a couple of really smart guys, they had a great idea, kind of in the dorm room, but they didn't have money. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : So in 1999, some very wise venture capital firms gave them money to help them grow. By 2004, Google was a publicly traded company, and today they have tens of thousands of workers. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And nobody's complaining about that. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Right, that's a popular way of investing private equity, to do a venture that grows very rapidly, and pretty much everybody likes that sort of thing. But then there are other ways that the complaints are that it goes too far. And there's sort of this generic term that's being kicked around now, vulture capitalism, that it's that - that there are these other strategies that are harmful to workers. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And in this idea, you go into a company, and you either charge fees that are far too high, you bid on the company in an auction, maybe you do various things that drive down the price, and you try to get it as cheaply as possible. And then you invest in it, but you invest in it with a lot of borrowed dollars, and you load the company up with too much debt, you charge too high of fees, and the next thing you know, a lot of workers end up being laid off. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Now, the private equity fund managers may still make a very good amount of money because they'll get fees, and maybe they'll make a profit. But a lot of times the workers really suffer, or at least they - certainly they lose their jobs, and they feel bad about that. So there is this question of, is there - are there forms of capitalism that are just too rough, that result in too big of profits for some people and too much suffering for others? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : As the controversy in the Republican discussion seems to be about what - you're talking about this second kind, where companies come in and are perceived as having caused harm - the role of debt, you mentioned that. In other words, the outside buyers borrow a lot of money, buy the company, and then the debt that is owed becomes owed by the company that they bought. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And that is - you know, let's think about it in terms of maybe if you buy your own home with a mortgage, if you go into a situation where you're buying a house, and you borrow a lot of money to do that, you know, maybe that ends up being a great investment for you over time, and you may profit from it, but when you first take on all of that debt, you might have to do all sorts of things to save money, to cut your costs. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : You might have to, you know, stop going out to restaurants. You maybe can't take vacations. You have to do all sorts of things to cut your costs to be able to manage that new debt that you've just taken on. And that's what happens at a lot of these companies: They get a lot of debt, and they have to do something to live within the means, given this new debt, and often that means a lot of people get laid off. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, what if there's a company that is perhaps not the world's most profitable company, sitting - I'll work with some bland stereotypes. Pick a Midwestern company, a small manufacturing firm, by smallish I mean maybe it employs 400 workers, it makes a single product, it's owned by a family, and it's cooking along, and it's not actually squeezing every last penny out of the operation that it could. And yet it's employed families for several generations, it supports the local baseball team, it's a good civic citizen, and the owning family really isn't that hungry to squeeze more profit out of it. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Why - what's the argument for not just leaving that alone as opposed to having an outside investor coming in and seeing the opportunity to squeeze more profit, which would result in the layoffs? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : In a lot of cases, there may be a family-owned business that's exactly as you describe. There are actually lots and lots of businesses like that. But maybe the family, the founder of it is ready to retire, he'd like to take his profits and move on. And the company hasn't been quite as profitable as it should have - it could be under other ownership. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : That owner may put their company up for auction, and somebody will come in and buy it and say OK, we're here to clean up now. And they will do things like no more sponsorship of the Little League, and, you know... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Because they don't have the connection, they're maybe from thousands of miles away. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Right, just they're there to make a profit. And the argument is that's what capitalism is, that you come in, and your goal is to make a profit, not to support the Little League team. Your goal is not to have nice, cozy office furniture. It's not to keep the same person employed after 30 years, even if their skills are rusty. You job is to make money for your investors. So that's the way you have to - you know, that a capitalist would look at it. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : And the argument is if you don't do that with that business, sooner or later, the customers are going to get fed up with it, it won't be very... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Because? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Well, they may say that the costs are too high. There's competition... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : The cost of the product, you mean? MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : The price of the product that they make is too high, there's a competitor somewhere in China who can make it more cheaply. So eventually that business is going to go out anyway because they're no longer competitive. So the private equity firm could come in with an infusion of new money and cut to the bone and make it much more profitable. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : But it's a - it can be a very painful and brutal process for the people who are at that company. And then they big question really is: Are the profits outsized? Does the private equity firm get too much? Now, at Bain, the example there was during his time at Bain, it's been estimated that he had a pool of capital that was collected up of $1.1 billion, and because of deals that he helped put together, Bain profited - it had gains of $2.5 billion. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : Now, one might say that, well, what if their profits were just a little bit less? Would you have to have laid off that many people? And that's really where the argument is, is do you absolutely maximize profits? JOHN DONVAN, HOST : We've asked listeners to call in with their stories of going through some of these experiences, and I want to go to Deborah(ph) in Sacramento. Deborah, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. So what happened in your case? DEBORAH : In our situation, it was 1987, and our company was a family-owned company out of Salt Lake that was a Western trucking company. It's been a profitable business for 80 years. And we were purchased by some venture capitalists as the founder of our company became old and, as you say, could no longer manage the company anymore. DEBORAH : And they bought the company, they took us on the tarmac in the seven Western states and said be assured, send your kids to college, we're here to stay, nothing's going to change. And within a very short period of time, we were closed. DEBORAH : The company was asset-rich, they sold off all of our assets, our real estate in Las Angeles, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Oregon. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Why do you think, Deborah, they told you don't worry, and then it turned out you had to worry? Do you think they changed their minds, or do you think they were misleading you in the first place? \n\n ###",

We're talking about venture capital firms. In the latest political back-and-forth, some of them are calling them job-killers, others job creators. NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax is helping us to navigate these complicated waters.

Our email address is talk@npr.org. I'm John Donvan. This is TALK OF THE NATION. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm John Donvan. There are more than 2,000 private equity firms headquartered in the U.S. backing more than 14,000 companies, and that's a lot of cash, and it's also a lot of jobs. But most of us rarely hear about venture capital, except in this political season, the term is being hurled at Mitt Romney by his opponents as an insult. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : He co-founded Bain Capital before he went into politics, and Rick Perry took to calling him a vulture capitalist. Today we're talking about venture capital firms actually do and how they do it and why at this particular moment they've become controversial.

She's a senior business editor at NPR. We've posted a link to her latest piece, which explains venture capitalism, at npr.org. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And now we want to turn to two people with very different views of the industry. Joining us now via Skype from his office in Chicago is Steven Davis, he's a professor of international business and economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Welcome to the program, Steven. STEVEN DAVIS : Thank you. Thanks for having me. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Thanks for joining us. And also joining us in Studio 3A is Eileen Appelbaum. She is a senior economist at the Center for Economic Policy Research. Nice to have you with us, as well, Eileen. EILEEN APPELBAUM : Glad to be here. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : And Eileen, you heard what we just heard from the caller a few minutes ago, telling the story of her experience with a venture capital firm being disastrous for the business she had worked with and for, for years. Is that the norm, or is that the unusual bad apple case. EILEEN APPELBAUM : So first let me just help make a distinction between venture capital and private equity. Venture capital invests in early stage companies like Google and takes an equity stake. They don't load these companies up with debt because what would you use as an asset on these newly forming companies? EILEEN APPELBAUM : So it's a very different model than the private equity model. The private equity model deals with more mature firms. It purchases them by putting up a little bit of equity and borrowing a lot of debt. And the important point, Marilyn made the point about buying a house and having a mortgage. EILEEN APPELBAUM : When you buy a house, and you have a mortgage, you are responsible for paying the mortgage. When a private equity firm buys a business, it is the business that puts up a little bit of equity and finances the rest, just like a mortgage, but it is not the private equity firm that has to pay that mortgage. It is the company that they've acquired. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : So if Private Equity Firm A buys Company B with debt, Private Equity Firm A is never liable for that debt? It's only the first it has bought? EILEEN APPELBAUM : That is correct, and so the most the private equity can lose is its initial down payment. So I just wanted to clarify that point. And in terms of the caller, there's two issues here. One is the initial founder of that company founded that company to last for as anybody could see. It lasted many decades under that person's leadership. \n\n ###",

EILEEN APPELBAUM : You have to have relationships with all kinds of stakeholders, and your long-term viability depends on those relationships with the community, with your workers, with your suppliers, with your vendors and so on. Private equity comes in, and the Sacramento case that we just heard seemed to go under pretty quickly. EILEEN APPELBAUM : Typically they hold a company for six years, on average that's what they hold a company for, and they need to be profitable in that timeframe. The example that she gave - so it's not a generalizable(ph) example, but when private equity comes into a firm that has assets, such as retail, for example, or nursing homes or the case that we heard, typically they divide that company into two companies: a property company and an operating company. EILEEN APPELBAUM : And all of the valuable assets go into the property company. They can sell that property company, make back their initial investment, maybe even make a profit on it, pay off the debt, and private equity has no more skin in the game. So whether the operating company succeeds or not, whether that trucking company succeeds or not... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right, I want to bring in Steven Davis in the conversation, but just before we do that, I want to bring in one more caller who's going to share his story. I want to ask Matt(ph) in Cincinnati to join us. Matt, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. MATT : Thanks. Yes, I worked as a financial - for a health care company, a home health care company in Arizona, and prior to being taken over by a private equity company, it was very undisciplined, we really weren't very profitable, mainly because there wasn't a lot of discipline in the employees. MATT : And about three months after the company took us over, there was a lot of discipline, and we became very profitable within two years. We grew three times our revenue, and five years later, we were sold. And I credit the private equity group a lot with bringing that level of discipline to us because prior to that, the founder made about $60,000 a year or whatever, a salary, but there wasn't a lot of emphasis on growth or making more money. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Is it your sense, Matt, that the company would have gone under sooner rather than later if the outside company hadn't come in? MATT : Yeah, because there were a lot of competitors coming in and taking away the nurses, the good nurses, and leaving us with all the bad employees and such. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right, let me bring in Steven Davis, who's a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and many other credentials. Steven, you know, respond to the story Matt's sharing with us from Cincinnati. STEVEN DAVIS : Well, it's interesting. You know, we've heard two stories now, both fairly vivid, and one paints a negative picture of private equity, and one paints a positive picture. And in fact much of what we think we know about private equity is based on stories and anecdotes like this, and there's a shortage of systematic study of a scientific sort that looks at outcomes in the wake of private equity buyouts and compares them to firms that are otherwise similar in an effort to draw some type of inference about what the net effect of the private equity transactions are overall. STEVEN DAVIS : And that's how I approach this topic, and that's how my co-authors and I approached our study. So we wanted to get beyond anecdotes and stories and try to characterize, in a systematic way, what seems to happen broadly on average, in the big picture. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, let me ask Eileen Appelbaum: Do you agree with Steven on what the big picture is? EILEEN APPELBAUM : Well, let's have him tell us what he thinks it is, and then we'll see. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right, Steven, what is your big picture? STEVEN DAVIS : So our study looks at most of the private equity buyout transactions that occurred from 1980 to 2005, and we found that the firms acquired by private equity did involve the loss of more jobs at a faster pace than firms that are otherwise similar in terms of industry, size, age and prior growth but that they also created more new jobs at a faster pace than these otherwise similar firms. STEVEN DAVIS : So there was both more destruction of old jobs and more creation of new jobs at - in the aftermath of these private equity transactions. The net effect on employment was actually fairly modest. Depending on exactly how you measure it, one to percent of initial employment over two years. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Went down. STEVEN DAVIS : Yes, went down, yes. So that would be kind of the first headline from our study. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Eileen? \n\n ###",

I've looked at Steve's work very carefully, and I agree that it is probably the best that we have. It's a really large-scale, careful study. But my problem with his conclusion is that he is looking, not just at jobs created at the companies that are taken over or other jobs destroyed at the companies taken over relative to others, at branches or stores or factories that were closed and at (unintelligible) plants that were opened. EILEEN APPELBAUM : If you look only at those, you find a much larger loss of jobs than the headline figure he just gave you. The way he gets that headline figure is he also includes acquisitions. So when private equity takes over some of these smaller companies, it grows them by acquiring other companies. Now, when they acquire those other companies, they acquire their employees. There's no net job creation. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Eileen, I hear what your point is, and I want to let Steven respond quick. STEVEN DAVIS : Yeah, I don't think that's quite right. I gave the one- to two-percent range earlier, and the one-percent figure comes about, as Eileen suggested, when you take into account both acquisitions and divestitures. The two-percent figure comes in - is what we call organic job change. In other words, excluding the acquisitions and divestitures. STEVEN DAVIS : So she's right that it does make a difference, we highlight this fact in the study, in fact one of the main advances of our study over previous work is we're able to actually draw that distinction. And I agree with Eileen that it's an important distinction to draw. STEVEN DAVIS : But the difference between the two headline numbers, with and without acquisitions and divestitures, is not all that large, especially when you think about this over a two-year period. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : All right. Let's return, however, to the land of the anecdote and bring in Sherry(ph) in Richmond, Virginia. Sherry, you're on TALK OF THE NATION. SHERRY : Yes. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : You're on the air. Go ahead, please. SHERRY : Yes. I was - my company was a victim of vulture capitalism in 1985, Carl Icahn, the corporate raider, the movie \"Wall Street\" was made about him, greenmailed my company. I - most of us flight attendants were out of work for two and a half to three and a half years. We came back at a reduced salary. He sold off our London routes, and he used this to begin his career in investing by using our pension funds of which I never - we never recovered them. He used 75 percent of the flight attendants' pension funds. I don't think this is too constructive. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, I guess the question again is, what would have happened in the absence of Carl Icahn coming in? What was happening to TWA at the time? And I want us - Marilyn, are you familiar... SHERRY : Well, it wasn't properly managed, and it was worth a lot more than the stock was selling for (unintelligible). JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Well, let's bring in NPR's Marilyn Geewax. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE : This is why these arguments can be so complicated because there were lots of airlines that got involved with various takeover kinds of plans and mergers. That's certainly true of the steel industry, too. But a lot of those businesses would have gone out of business anyway. And some people would argue that when the funds that made money from either taking away their pension plans or laying off workers or whatever that created new profits that could be invested in new and more profitable ventures. So how you pull back far enough to look at the really big picture : Did money that some company made in its profits by shutting down some old steel mill that created a new pool of capital to put into a Google and ultimately it created more jobs or is it just vicious and it just crushes people? Those are awfully tough to get enough data to - and stand back long enough to see the big picture. So that's why it's so debatable. JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Which - and as you say, debatable, I guess, that's why it's rhetorically so available to Rick Perry out there. It's an easy enough slogan to throw around without having to pin down on either side. STEVEN DAVIS : Can I jump in here, make two points? STEVEN DAVIS : Very quickly, Steven, because we're (unintelligible). STEVEN DAVIS : First, I just want to endorse - I largely share the view that Eileen just expressed that it is hard to evaluate these issues. The second point I wanted to make is because many of the private equity companies acquired by private equity are in some distress... JOHN DONVAN, HOST : Steven, I'm sorry I need you to wrap in 15 seconds. \n\n ###",

Welcome all of you. Mr. GUSTAVO ARELLANO (Columnist, AskaMexican.net) : Hi. Ms. CARMEN VAN KERCHOVE (Blogger) : Hi. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Hi. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Hi. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK. Well, let's pick up where John and Alex left off and talk about Hillary. Should she or should she not exit, and let's start with you Angela. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : I guess I've always been confused by this question. Because it's never been a surprise when these primaries were coming, and the Democratic National Committee made these dates including Howard Dean, so every time he acts like she's just refusing to leave the party, like she's the one downstairs refusing to understand that the keg is empty everybody else has left. The reality is, the vote takes place at the convention. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : I think she should go. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Francis, you think she should go? Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : I think she should go. We need to unite this party. And you know I've said it before, I think she's the better candidate. I think that Barack is a better movement. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And Gustavo? Mr. GUSTAVO ARELLANO (Columnist, AskaMexican.net) : This campaign is in tatters. She has to leave. She's what, 31 million dollars in debt, she's increasingly becoming more and more bickering, throwing jabs at anybody who doesn't want to believe in her gospel that she was meant to be president. And I'm tired of Hillary Clinton. And I know nowadays we expect our candidates to be done way before the convention. It's not like the old days. When was the last time the Democrats had to fight over the convention? I think it was 68, and look at what happened there. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And Carmen Van Kerchove, what do you think? And I wonder if you could address what Hillary Clinton has been complaining of recently in an article in the Washington Post yesterday, where she says her campaign has been dogged by sexism on the part of some people who attend her rallies, on the part of the media, and of the part of political commentators all over the place. Ms. CARMEN VAN KERCHOVE (Blogger) : Whether or not Clinton should or should not go is really up to Clinton. But it just seems like the odds are against her. I mean this Gallup poll that came out yesterday, shows that Obama is sweeping every single demographic, except for women aged 50 and older. The criticisms that sexism exist are valid, but I don't think that sexism has been an orchestrated campaign tactic from the Obama camp. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Angela, as our lone Hillary supporter on this panel, what do you say to that? Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : It actually has nothing to do with my point. I have to say number one, I keep hearing this comparison to '68, and I just don't think it's accurate or fair. In '68 we were in the middle of the rights movement, there were massive riots all around the country. It's absolutely a completely different situation. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : And we're different people. Ms. ANGELA SHELTON (Comedian) : Try to compare the convention then to a convention now? It's an unfair and kind of simplistic comparison. Further, neither of them will reach the number of delegates, they can't mathematically, that would put them at 2,025 which would make them the presumptive nominee. Neither of them will. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Here we've had for the last seven years, we haven't been able to talk about anything, about what our government was doing about who was in our government. You weren't patriotic, you weren't supporting the troops, it wasn't appropriate. Now we have this opportunity, for yes for a long time, to do that, and people want to shut it up. I want to hear everything up until that convention. And as for the tit for tat insulting each other back and forth, I've heard it from both sides. I've heard the Hillary people say Obama campaign attacks them and it's sexist, I've heard the Obama people say Hillary attacks the affirmative action candidates, and blah blah blah. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : The reality is when it comes to issues of isms - racism, not so much homophobia, people tend to be a little more out in the open about that unfortunately, but racism and sexism, people lie, you know. And that's why the polling is so off. When people walk out of a poll they're not going to say oh I didn't vote for the black guy 'cause he's black. Even people in the Klan don't say that. You ask the Klan member if he doesn't like black people, and he's says no, I just love white people. Like they won't even say it so I think there's so many X factors here, it's hard to predict. \n\n ###",

Mr. GUSTAVO ARELLANO (Columnist, AskaMexican.net) : Unless you're in West Virginia. It's interesting with Obama. A lot of people have insinuated that Barack's the Manchurian Muslim really, just waiting to assume the position of the White House and then allow al-Qaeda into this country. Even though he has no connection with Islam other than his father, who apparently never really practiced Islam, and he has had more of a challenge to face then Clinton just based on the status, if you want to call it, their isms. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Yeah, I guess. I feel like that debate is not, you know, people are going to argue that from both sides. What I think is, we as voters we should be offended because we've been attacked by the media. For the first time in one of the pollings this morning, I was reading an article where they actually polled for in Kentucky to see who was a non-college graduate and who they voted for.

Ms. VAN KERCKHOVE : Is that, you know, they're uneducated... Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Yeah, uneducated. They're stupid, they don't know what's good for them and it's wrong. Its classist and I don't appreciate it. What most people should know about the working class, is that most of it thinks it's middle class. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Right. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : They have no idea that we're talking about them. Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : You know?

Ms. FRANCIS CALLIER (Comedian) : Right. Ms. VAN KERCKHOVE : Supposedly uneducated crowd that you're talking about. Then there is that sort of lack of surprise that Obama won Oregon because there's this assumption, that well there's all those Portland people who eat, you know, organic vegetables and drink gourmet coffee.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta described an Iranian nuclear weapon as a red line - unacceptable to the United States; presumably, cause for war. But many analysts believe that a clandestine war is already under way as Israel and the U.S. try to slow down Iran's nuclear program. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Just last week, an Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated in Tehran, at least the fourth to be killed over the past couple of years. Late last year, huge explosions destroyed an Iranian missile base, and various types of sabotage have disrupted Iran's uranium enrichment facilities. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nobody knows for sure who's responsible. Iran blames Israel, the U.S. and Britain. If you have questions about the ethics and goals of this clandestine war, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, Tuesdays with Dorie - bakers alert. But first, the covert war with Iran, and we begin with Patrick Clawson, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, where he directs the Iran Security Initiative. He's kind enough to join us today here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for coming in. PATRICK CLAWSON : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And you've been quoted as saying that a lot of people have asked you when Israel is going to attack Iran, and you say two years ago. PATRICK CLAWSON : What's going on now - with assassinations and cyberwar - is, wantonly, acts of war. And when you combine that with the U.N. sanctions, which block Iran's access to many of the key materials and technology that it needs; the U.S. program of encouraging defections from Iran's nuclear program - one of their key scientists showed up in Washington last year, before he made the bad decision to return; and the Swiss government had to reveal the U.S. role in sabotaging equipment going to Iran after they arrested some Swiss for selling things to Iran, and then let them go. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Double embarrassment - they had to reveal that the Swiss were selling equipment for Iran's nuclear program, and then that those pieces had been doctored by the United States to fail. PATRICK CLAWSON : Well, the Swiss government made huge publicity announcements about the arrests of these people and saying, this kind of activity cannot be allowed in Switzerland. And then a month later, when they let the people go, the Parliament said, hey, what's going on? PATRICK CLAWSON : And the Swiss had to acknowledge that all of those parts that had been sold to Iran had been shipped via Los Alamos - which is not the most logical route. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Not the most logical route. And then there is the Stuxnet worm, the computer virus that appears to have, in some cases, seriously afflicted Iran's nuclear uranium enrichment facilities. PATRICK CLAWSON : It also appears to be the gift that keeps on giving, in that it appears that there are still other parts of the Stuxnet virus which can be - which may be activated later on. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so Iran's nuclear program keeps trying to get stalled, and that's the goal here, no? PATRICK CLAWSON : They've been at it for 24 years. That's a long time. And as one senior U.S. government official puts it to me, if 24 years from now they're still at it, that will constitute success. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That will - in other words, some people say Iran is as little as a year away; some say longer than that. Some question whether Iran is mounting a nuclear weapons program at all; that's another point. But presumably, if they are, the goal is to stretch that time period out as long as possible with acts of war? PATRICK CLAWSON : Look, it would be much better if we could engage with Iran and get them to agree to suspend their program, as the Security Council has called on them to do. It would be much better if the Iranians would agree to engage with the Obama administration in official bilateral talks - as for years they said they wanted to do in the United States. And if those things don't happen - well, then we have to look around for alternatives. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And this alternative, this clandestine war, preferable to all-out war? PATRICK CLAWSON : I would certainly think so. I mean, all-out war has - can go all kinds of ways that would be quite terrible to think about. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's bring another voice into the conversation. Gary Sick, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Middle East Institute; he's also professor of international affairs there at Columbia; joins us by phone from his office in New York. Nice to have you back on the program. GARY SICK : Glad to be here, Neal. \n\n ###",

GARY SICK : I think it amounts to warfare, period. The - and actually, I would like to go beyond just the clandestine part because I think there's another kind of stealth attack being mounted, that we tend to dismiss. But first of all, to look at the cyberwarfare - indeed, there's no question that the Stuxnet worm has had an impact on Iran's centrifuges, though from all appearances they seem to have overcome that, and they are now producing enriched uranium once again. Maybe they had - they suffered some problems from it, but you know, they continue to keep on producing. GARY SICK : What was interesting to me was a report today that Israel is under cyberattack. El-Al Airlines and the stock exchange are both suffering denial-of-service attacks. And a - what claims to be a Saudi hacker named Ox Omar has released thousands of Israeli credit card names and numbers and so forth, on a public website. GARY SICK : My point here is that this is something that can actually cut both ways. And, you know, we've been patting ourselves on the back -very much so - about this brilliant cyberattack of Stuxnet but, you know, nobody seems to ask the question of whether there isn't going to be some blowback from that - because of all the fields in the world where you can play, probably the cyberwarfare field is the levelest. GARY SICK : Iran actually has a capacity to hit us almost as great as our capacity to hit them. And that is something which I really wish we had thought about a little bit more, before we started that process. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Indeed, there was some suspicion with the Venezuelan consul in Miami - may have been involved, allegedly, in a plot with Iranian officials to do exactly that, Gary Sick - be involved in some cyberattacks or preparatory to some cyberattacks against the United States. But if it slows down the Iranian nuclear program, is not that a benefit? GARY SICK : Well, it all depends. You see, if this had stopped the Iranian nuclear program, then perhaps you could make that argument. The most it did was force them to stop, re-gear, clean up their system, and then go back to work.  And that was a matter of months - I mean, literally, a matter of weeks or months by the time they recovered from the thing. GARY SICK : Now, there may be more; as Patrick Clawson said, more pieces of this ready to go into action later on. But that - but if - for instance, the power plant in your town, in your neighborhood, suddenly goes out of control and blows up. Would you regard that as a reasonable price to pay for that temporary slowdown of the centrifuges in Natanz? GARY SICK : And there will be no fingerprints left on that if it happens. And in fact, you know, our own cybersecurity people, you know, are talking all the time about how truly vulnerable we are, because our entire system works on the Internet and involves that kind of activity. GARY SICK : So you know, I'm a little concerned. And sometimes on these things, we act as if we are able to function with total impunity - we can do what we like, but nobody can do it to us. An Israeli commentator just yesterday made the remark that these assassinations of Iranian scientists - who, at least the Iranians certainly believe are Israeli hits; which, you know, we'll never be able to prove it, probably - what if they started assassinating Western scientists? GARY SICK : So you've got a Western, you know, convention of scientists on some subject and suddenly, some of them are bumped off. There's no security, for the most part, around these events. Is that something that we've either thought about, or we're willing to accept? Maybe the people who carried out the operation are, but the people who are likely to be the targets may not have the same view. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Patrick Clawson, that would certainly be described as an act of terrorism. PATRICK CLAWSON : Yes. And look, Israel already faces a situation in which Iran provides weapons and financing for terrorist groups that are trying to kill innocent Israelis all the time and unfortunately, succeed all too often. I'm talking about Hezbollah and Hamas. PATRICK CLAWSON : And so Israel feels that Iran's shooting at Israel, and those who are shooting shouldn't be surprised to get shot back at. So I don't think it would be appropriate for the United States to be in a campaign of assassinations with the Iranian nuclear scientists, but Israel is in a different situation. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And... PATRICK CLAWSON : We - by the way, the United States is in a vigorous campaign of assassinations. We do it through Predator drones, including against our own citizens - Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, for instance. Mr. Awlaki was never accused of having picked up a gun, but we felt it was all right to kill him without any trial. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation. We're talking about the covert war against Iran's nuclear ambitions - 800-989-8255; email  talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Tom, Tom with us from Greenville in North Carolina. TOM : Thank you, yes. I was wondering who the supporting countries or states - that are supporting Iran's goals to become a nuclear power, either through just energy or nuclear weapons. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, those are two different things, and very different things. Patrick Clawson, if you're talking about nuclear energy - clearly, Russia, which provided the reactor at Bushehr, which is a nuclear energy plant; if you're talking about nuclear weapons - well, you're talking about a rather murkier group of countries, including Pakistan, North Korea? PATRICK CLAWSON : Well, we don't know about North Korea. We know very little about what North Korea may or may not be doing with Iran's nuclear program, and it's very troubling. There was a case of a Ukrainian scientist who the IAEA pointed out was providing considerable assistance to... \n\n ###",

And indeed, he felt that he was helping with a process for producing artificial diamonds, which is something that he has long been convinced is how this technology can be used. Not everybody else agrees that that's the principal use you'd make of his technology. He spent many years in the Soviet nuclear program. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But at this point, Iran's nuclear program may not need any more assistance from the outside. PATRICK CLAWSON : Not clear. If I were an Iranian leader, I'd be kind of nervous about how well my systems would work at actually making highly enriched uranium.

Last week, motorcyclists streaked by a car, attached a magnetic bomb. The blast tore the silver Peugeot apart and killed the nuclear scientist riding inside, and his driver. The scientist, described as a chemistry expert, director of Iran's main uranium - nuclear enrichment facility. It also fatally wounded his driver. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Iran's atomic energy organization condemned the bombing as a heinous act, and vowed to continue down the nuclear path. As the U.S. and its allies lean on Iran to abandon nuclear ambitions through diplomacy and sanctions, a covert plan to pressure Iran seems to be gaining steam.

Gary Sick, you mentioned earlier that this clandestine warfare is just part of the campaign against Iran. The other part is these economic sanctions, which are ratcheting ever higher. GARY SICK : Yes, you know, we've been using sanctions against Iran - usually, financial sanctions, or sanctions against their energy industry - we've been doing it - the United States has been doing it very actively since 1995. We had some sanctions on Iran before that, but those were the directed ones against their energy industry. GARY SICK : And so we started in 1995 to sanction their industry, and oppose Iran. At the time we started those sanctions, Iran had not one, single centrifuge turning in the country. Today, after more than 16 years of gradually increasing sanctions, Iran now has at least 8,000 operational centrifuges, and a considerable store of low-enriched uranium. To me, that's a description of a failed policy. GARY SICK : And what we have done at each stage is increase the sanctions because the last ones didn't work. You finally get to a point where you can't tell sanctions from warfare. The sanctions that the Congress has imposed now, in the latest defense authorization bill, basically call for the United States - for all the countries of the world but the United States, in particular, to force Iran's banks not to be able to - not to be able to sell their oil, so that Iran basically is cut off from its oil sales completely. That's 50 percent of Iran's income. GARY SICK : Now, I think most countries who were faced with a threat of 50 percent of their national revenues being cut off would regard that as a hostile act, no matter how you look at it. And I think we need to remember, too, that if those sanctions were actually successful - they actually succeeded in cutting off Iran's oil exports - Iran would then have no motivation to not close the Strait of Hormuz. GARY SICK : Right now, they can't close it, and they would not even be tempted to close it because their own oil goes out that way. But if their oil is cut off, then probably you can assume that Iran is not going to sit on its hands and simply, you know, moan its fate. It's going to probably do something. GARY SICK : And there are things that Iran could do to interfere with the oil-shipping in the Persian Gulf, which is a huge part of the world's oil supply. So I think, again, we need to think about what the consequences are of some of the things that we're doing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Patrick Clawson, the Iranians have always said if we can't ship oil through the Strait of Hormuz, nobody can ship oil through the Strait of Hormuz. PATRICK CLAWSON : Well, the U.S.'s goal is to get back to negotiations. You talk to anybody in the Obama Iran team, and they portray these sanctions as an instrument. And the objective is to get back to negotiations, to engage with Iran and to reach an agreement with the Iranians. PATRICK CLAWSON : And so it's not like the Obama administration is a bunch of warmongers; quite the contrary. They see the way this dispute's going to be settled is through a negotiation. And the question is, what can they do to get negotiations started? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### PATRICK CLAWSON : Obama offered negotiations when he came into office, extended a hand of friendship. And the Iranians, who for years had said that they wanted to have negotiations without preconditions with the U.S. government, have done exactly nothing to take that up. PATRICK CLAWSON : And that's very frustrating to the Obama team because their objective's always focused on, how do we get back to negotiations? It's been more than a year since the last time that Iran sat down with the countries negotiating about the nuclear issue - that's the so-called P5-plus-1, the permanent five members of the United Nations plus Germany. And nobody would be happier than the Obama administration if there could be fruitful discussions again. PATRICK CLAWSON : Now, there's talk about a new round of negotiations. The Iranians claim that they're interested in this. Let's hope that's true. Let's hope that this time when they show up, they do something other than talk about their principles for how to manage the world - and every other topic except the nuclear matter. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Tony(ph), Tony's on the line from San Antonio. TONY : So many questions, Neal, so little time. TONY : One point - actually, I have two questions. First, should they weaponize their nuclear program, how far away do they - do your panel guests feel they are from actually being able to deliver those weapons? And where is the rest of the Middle East? Where is Saudi? Where is Turkey in this equation, should we say - this negotiation equation? They have a more vested interest in a nuclear-free Iran than the United States does. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A couple of interesting questions, Tony. Delivery systems - Patrick Clawson, that mysterious explosion that devastated a missile-development facility outside of Tehran, and killed a general. The Iranians initially said it was an accident, and it's increasingly - a lot of people think it was an act of sabotage. PATRICK CLAWSON : Well, Iran has a pretty sophisticated missile program, which they're - working away at it. However, it probably is going to be several years before they could have a nuclear warhead that would fit on a missile that they could deliver, say, to Israel. And that's the reason that U.S. officials - and increasingly, Israeli officials - are reasonably confident that Iran's not going to rush to assemble a nuclear device, a primitive, bomb-like thing which they could explode - similar to what the North Koreans did. But instead, Iran's going to wait until it can actually have a warhead on a missile. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The whole package. PATRICK CLAWSON : The whole package, and that would certainly be several years from now. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And in terms of its neighbors - Gary Sick, Saudi Arabia is a rival to Iran; I think that's clear on any number of fronts. Turkey, though - that's another question. GARY SICK : Yeah, I think the neighbors each have their own foreign policy, and Iran has its own foreign policy toward those neighbors. I would like to address that first part of the question. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure, go ahead. GARY SICK : Because with regard to Iran actually building a nuclear weapon, the IAEA report, even the most alarming one - the most recent one - did not say that Iran was building. NEAL CONAN, HOST : No smoking gun. GARY SICK : There really isn't. And I was really struck the other day when Leon Panetta, who is now the secretary of Defense but was just not long ago the head of the CIA, he was asked point-blank, is Iran building a nuclear weapon? And his answer to that was, no. GARY SICK : And I thought that was really - that's the first time I've heard a senior U.S. official be so blunt and straightforward about it. Now, one can be concerned that Iran might change its mind and start building a nuclear weapon, but they haven't done it thus far. And it's the best judgment of the United States, and the intelligence services elsewhere, that they haven't done. GARY SICK : So to me, that's the starting point for analysis - which is basically, we do have quite a bit of time. Iran has been at this nuclear process since - call it 1985, when they probably made their first decision to get involved in a nuclear program. Here they are, all these years later, and they don't have a nuclear weapon. GARY SICK : No other country in the world, including Pakistan, which was really - had very little industrial capability, from the time they decided to build a bomb, they had one in hand within 12 years. Iran has been at this now for over 20 years, and we still - they still don't have a bomb. GARY SICK : I think you can either draw the conclusion that Iran is simply stupid, totally incompetent and have no ability to do these things; or you can draw the conclusion that in fact, contrary to popular belief, they really haven't been in a hurry to actually build a bomb. They've been interested in building a nuclear capability. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### GARY SICK : And these two things get confused in people's minds. I think it's important to keep those separate and to realize that in fact, there is time. And I do agree with Patrick that in fact, the answer to this is negotiations. I think we've seen some examples of negotiation in the past. I must add what Patrick said - that we proposed a swap solution for some of the uranium in 2009, the Turks and the Brazilians, at our - with our support, actually negotiated such an agreement with Iran, and we turned it down in 2010. GARY SICK : Why? Because it was getting in the way of our sanctions regime. And basically, if you let the sanctions drive things, then our objective is not to get to the negotiating table - which Iran was clearly offering at that point - but rather, to get more sanctions. We have to really keep it clear in our own head. GARY SICK : And I think if you look at what the Congress is doing right now, it's hard to read the new sanctions laws as being aimed to getting back to the negotiating table. It's intended for regime change. It is intended to basically, force Iran into a submissive position. And I think that is probably a very dangerous way to go about doing our business. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In there, you may have heard when Gary Sick was talking about why it had taken Iran so long to not develop a nuclear weapon, and you may have heard Patrick Clawson say sanctions in the background. But any case, let's see if we get another caller in on the conversation. Bill is on the line from Little Rock. BILL : Hello. Thank you. And I hope everyone is doing well today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thank you. BILL : My question and - is - concerns the assasinations, and why it appears as though it's assumed that they're being done by other countries and their operatives, as opposed to some group in Iran that maybe doesn't want Iran to have nuclear weapons and they want to stop it. Is there any possibility of that whatsoever? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Patrick Clawson, I've heard some speculation that maybe some of these scientists were taken out by the Iranians themselves, for various reasons. Maybe they were about to defect, or something like that. But I've not heard that speculation, as Bill mentions, that this might have been an internal group. PATRICK CLAWSON : Well, Iranians love conspiracy theories, and there are lots of conspiracy theories out there. But what we do know about these assassinations is that they were terribly professionally conducted. And that's not been typical of political assassinations inside Iran. There have been lots of assassinations inside Iran, but they've been done by pretty basic techniques - like, you know, shooting a gun, or a knife - whereas these assassinations were really, very sophisticated. For one thing, the people got away. PATRICK CLAWSON : And the agency which has used that kind of sophisticated assassination technique quite a bit in - around the world has been the Mossad. There was the episode in Dubai; a guy got caught on cameras. There was an episode in Oman a few years ago, which they botched. But this is typical of the Mossad's technique. So I would say that the Mossad starts out as the usual suspect. Now, sometimes, the obvious suspect is not the guilty party. But boy, I would start out with the Mossad as the obvious suspect. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And cui bono - who benefits? PATRICK CLAWSON : It's quite clear to see how the Israelis benefit. I mean, after all, it's the former head of the Mossad who has been the loudest voice inside Israel, saying there's no reason that Israel needs to have airstrikes against the Iranian nuclear program. The quiet subtext, which is an open secret in Israel, is what he's saying is: My agency solved this problem. We took cared of it; we've solved it. No reason for the military to get involved. GARY SICK : Neal, could I add a comment on this? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Please. GARY SICK : I - with response to the question about, could it be an internal group? Obviously, I agree with Patrick that Iran is full of conspiracy theories. But in reality, in January of 2011 - just a year ago - Iran actually announced that it had captured the killers of the \u2013 of a previous assassination; that they were people who had had training by, you know, by Mossad; that they had been trained by - this got very, very little coverage in the American media. GARY SICK : And it may not be true. I mean, they may be making this up. But at least, I think, there's no question that the Iranians truly believe that this is an outside hand that is doing this. And I think they've got very good reason for that. The conspiracy theories that somehow, the Iranians are doing it themselves - and I agree with Patrick very much, that the kind of sophisticated techniques are not typical of little groups that happened to form in a country like Iran, and carry out a really sophisticated assassination. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bill, thanks very much for the call. Gary Sick, of Columbia University; Patrick Clawson, of the Washington Institute. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. And Gary Sick, I wanted to ask you further about a piece you just wrote today, where you looked at what seemed to be very divergent statements from the Obama administration. Yes, on the one hand, Secretary of Defense Panetta says Iran is not trying to build a nuclear weapon. On the other hand, to build one is a red line; to close the Straits of Hormuz is a redline. There are bellicose statements coming. And at the same time, you suggest three-dimensional chess. What are you talking about? GARY SICK : It seems to me that the Obama administration has three, separate problems. One is that they really would like to get - that they worry very much about getting involved in a shooting war - which actually, there's almost nothing good that could come of that for the United States, for Iran, for the region - anything. So I think they don't want to get dragged into a war. The second thing is, they've got a problem because Israel continues to threaten an independent strike on Iran. GARY SICK : And I think the administration has to worry about that because if it happened, we would be dragged into it as well. And the third thing is that there's an election going on. And Obama has to worry about running for re-election under the charge that he's being soft on Iran, which already people are saying, quite openly, on the Republican side. NEAL CONAN, HOST : With one exception. Go ahead. \n\n ###",

He's also in our NPR Washington studios. Welcome back, Lawrence. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : It's always good to be back, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What about this graininess stuff? You were listening to that. What do you think about that experiment? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, that was a speculative idea, and most speculative ideas are wrong, and that's why it takes a while to make progress. And so I - in some sense I wouldn't call it a failure for theory. One of the most exciting, or two of the most exciting states to be in if you're a theorist are either wrong or confused. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Speaking of which, I'm sure you're going to leave us in an enlightened state by the time you're done today, talking about your book. The title of your book, give us a thumbnail sketch of how you get something from nothing. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, the title of the book, \"A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing\" deals with this question. It's been around for as long as people have really started to ask questions about the universe and is really at the heart of a lot of the world's religions. Why is there something rather than nothing? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : If we live in a universe full of stuff, how did it get here? And many people think that very question implies the need for a creator. But what's truly been amazing, and what the book's about is the revolutionary developments in both cosmology and particle physics over the past 30 or 40 years that have not only changed completely the way we think about the universe but made it clear that there's a plausible case for understanding precisely how a universe full of stuff, like the universe we live in, could result literally from nothing by natural processes. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And while it's a little pretentious, I'll be pretentious anyway, the idea, I think, is similar, if you think about it, to the origin of life, Darwin's demonstration that life, which appears to be designed here on Earth, the diversity of life can actually arise, that diversity can arise by natural causes. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And we don't yet know the true origin of life, but we think we'll understand it by chemistry, and what we're discovering is that in fact physics has suggested that maybe the same is true for the whole universe, that we don't need a creator. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And I guess most importantly that the question why is there something rather than nothing is really a scientific question, not a religious or philosophical question, because both nothing and something are scientific concepts, and our discoveries over the past 30 years have completely changed what we mean by nothing. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : In particular, nothing is unstable. Nothing can create something all the time due to the laws of quantum mechanics, and it's - it's fascinatingly interesting. And what I wanted to do was use the hook of this question, which I think as I say has provoked religious people, as well as scientists, to encourage people to try and understand the amazing universe that we actually live in. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255 is our number, we're talking with Lawrence Krauss author of a new book, which talks about, you know, how the universe began, where it's heading, how we got here, all that kind of stuff, \"A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing.\" IRA FLATOW, HOST : And if you'd like to ask Lawrence a question and get in on the conversation, maybe you have a question about how the universe is working, as I say our number is 1-800-989-8255. Tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I. Go to our Facebook page, /scifri, and our website at sciencefriday.com. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We'll take all of your questions and put them all together and ask Lawrence to talk about them. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Lawrence Krauss, who is author of \"A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing.\" He's also a foundation professor and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Our number, 1-800-989-8255. How did the idea - how did - you said that the physics has changed, what we know about the universe has changed so much, dramatically over the last few years, especially the idea that what we think of empty space is really not empty, correct? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : That's exactly right.  Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them. Now, that sounds of course like counting angels on the head of a pin; if you can't measure them, then it doesn't sound like it's science, but in fact you can't measure them directly. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : But we can measure their effects indirectly. These particles that are popping in and out of existence actually affect the properties of atoms and nuclei and actually are responsible for most of the mass inside your body. And in fact, really one of the things that motivated this book was the most profound discovery in recent times, and you even alluded to it in the last segment, the discovery that most of the energy of the universe actually resides in empty space. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : You take space, get rid of all the particles, all the radiation, and it actually carries energy, and that notion that in fact empty space - once you allow gravity into the game, what seems impossible is possible. It sounds like it would violate the conservation of energy for you to start with nothing and end up with lots of stuff, but the great thing about gravity is it's a little trickier. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Gravity allows positive energy and negative energy, and out of nothing you can create positive energy particles, and as long as a gravitational attraction produces enough negative energy, the sum of their energy can be zero. And in fact when we look out at the universe and try and measure its total energy, we come up with zero. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : I like to think of it as the difference between, say, a savvy stockbroker and an embezzler. The savvy stockbroker will buy stocks on margin with more money than they have, and as long as they get that money back in there before anyone notices, and in fact if the stocks go up, they end with money where they didn't have any before, whereas the embezzler, of course, is discovered. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, the universe is a savvy stockbroker. It can borrow energy, and if there's no gravity, it gets rid of it back before anyone notices. But if gravity is there, it can actually create stuff where there was none before. And you can actually create enough stuff to account for everything we see in the universe. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : But, you know, it's more than that because some people would say, and I've had this discussion with theologians and others, well, you know, just empty space isn't nothing. You know, there's space. How did the space get there? But the amazing thing is, once you apply in fact quantum mechanics to gravity, as you were beginning to allude again in the last segment, then it's possible, in fact it's implied, that space itself can be created where there was nothing before, that literally whole universes can pop out of nothing by the laws of quantum mechanics. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And in fact the question why is there something rather than nothing then becomes sort of trite because nothing is unstable. It will always produce something. The more interesting or surprising question might be why is there nothing. But of course if we ask that question, well, we wouldn't be here if that was true. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. In your book you talk about dialing backwards, first the idea that the universe is expanding at greater than the speed of light. Is that correct, still expanding? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Oh, absolutely. In fact, the discovery of this dark energy has told us that the future will be quite different than we thought, and that's one of the things I talk about in the book. Because of this dark energy, this energy of empty space, which is gravitationally repulsive, it's causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate, to speed up. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : In fact, the discovery of that was awarded this year's Nobel Prize. But if you think about what that implies for the future, distant galaxies are moving away from us faster and faster, and eventually they indeed will all be moving away from us faster than the speed of light, which is allowed in general relativity, and we won't see them. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And the universe, in the far future, will be cold and dark and empty. So in fact as my late friend Christopher Hitchens, who was writing the forward for the book before he passed away, used to say: Nothing is heading towards us as fast as it can. So another answer to the question why is there something rather than nothing is just wait. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And of course we're getting questions already. Here's a tweet from Maggie Kelley(ph), who says: So if space is infinitely expanding, what is it expanding into? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, that's a good question. It's a question people often ask. And the answer is it doesn't need to expand into anything. The only two ways I know to try and explain this - well, the simplest way perhaps is to think of a rubber bedsheet that's infinitely big. Now stretch it. It's now bigger, but it wasn't expanding into anything because it was already infinitely big. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Now, if you don't like infinities, and there's a good reason to not be comfortable with infinities, just think of a balloon, and of course when you blow up a balloon, you think, sure, it's expanding into the room, but that's because you've embedded this two-dimensional surface of a balloon into this three-dimensional space. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : But if the two-dimensional surface of the balloon was all there was, as it expanded, the balloon would get bigger, and every dot on that balloon, if you painted dots on that balloon, would move away from every other dot, but it wouldn't be expanding into anything, it would just be getting bigger. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : So our universe, in fact, doesn't need to expand into anything. Space can expand on its own, whether the universe is finite or infinite, without boundary and without expanding into anything. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to Scott in San Francisco. Hi Scott, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SCOTT : Hi, and thanks for taking my call. I'll make it quick. I was just wondering if - are some ideas being investigated in space-time recently, in terms of the Higgs field and the Higgs Boson, are these in some way kind of a revisiting of the idea of aluminiferous ether, as they used to talk about? I know there's differences, but is this kind of ether revisited now? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, that's a good question. In a kind of philosophical sense, yes. Both the Higgs field and this dark energy that's permeating everything are indeed permeating empty space. And in that sense empty space is - has properties that you would not otherwise imagine, just like we - they used to imagine as an ether. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Of course, a difference was the ether was thought to be necessary to propagate light, and it was also thought to create a special frame of reference, and neither of these things do that. So neither of these things are of ether. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : But in a philosophical sense they hearken back to the idea that empty space is full of something. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Yeah, I mean for a variety of reasons. One is in the far future, and by the far future I mean hundreds of billions of years, astronomers and radio hosts on planets around other stars will look out at the universe, and what they'll see is the universe we thought we lived in 100 years ago, all of the other galaxies will have disappeared expect for our own, and people will assume, or beings will assume, they live in a universe that's basically infinite, dark and empty except for one galaxy, with no evidence of the Big Bang. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : So we're living at this rare cosmic instant in which we're lucky enough to observe the Big Bang. By rare - by cosmic instant I mean a few hundred billion years, but in a cosmic sense that's an instant. And so we're fortunate to be able to see that. At the same time, of course, it should give us some cosmic humility because it suggests - it indicates something that's very important to realize. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : When you're talking about the whole universe, we're limited by what we can see because science is an empirical discipline, and we have to be able - and the universe continues to surprise us, and it only can surprise us if we can measure it. And we're stuck in one universe, and we're stuck at the time we live in, 13.72 billion years after the Big Bang, and maybe a lot earlier we might have been able to discover other things, or a lot later, but we are fascinatingly lucky at this point to be able to see the evidence of the Big Bang. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And moreover, in even a grander sense, when one talks about a universe that could easily have come into existence by accident, I even show how current theory suggests maybe even the laws of physics themselves came into being by accident, with no purpose, no design, you might get depressed. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : But from my point of view, it's really exciting and should energize us because it suggests that we're unbelievably fortunate that we happen to live in a universe that not only supports life but that consciousness has evolved, and we can appreciate this remarkable universe around us, and we should make the moment - most of our brief moment in the sun. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : We should provide the meaning of the universe in the meaning of our own lives. So I think science doesn't necessarily have to get in the way of kind of spiritual fulfillment. In fact, I would argue the real story of the universe is far more interesting than any myths or fairy tales that people wrote thousands of years before they even knew the Earth went around the sun. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We're talking to Lawrence Krauss, author of \"A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing.\" Let's go to John(ph) in Salt Lake City. Hi, welcome. JOHN : Thank you. Yeah, I just had a comment. I thought maybe it would be a better idea to call it God's glue rather than dark matter, just to comment. Thanks. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well... LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, you know, you hearken back to the statement of Steve Weinberg, which is really true. I put it a slightly different way. The universe is the way it is whether you like it or not. And you can call it whatever you want, but - and you might - and scientists might want something, and religious people might want something too. And I think the great difference and the great wonder of science is that our faith is shakable, not unshakable, that if we discover the universe isn't the way we wanted it to be, well, too bad. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : In fact, we learn to like it even better. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. Gary in Groveland, California. Hi, Gary. GARY : Hi, thank you for taking my call. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Go ahead. GARY : With all due respect, and I find what you're saying fascinating, but where is the practicality for us on Earth? What is it doing for us today or even in the very near future? LAWRENCE KRAUSS : Well, you know, it's a good question. And I put it back to you. I'd say, well, what does a Bach cantata or a Picasso painting do for us? I think the point is we are human beings, and one of the most wonderful aspect of being human beings is being creative and asking questions and trying to understand our place in the universe. And it is absolutely true that understanding the beginning and end of the universe is not going to produce a better toaster. But I'm always amazed that people - for me, one of the great virtues of science is it's a cultural activity, like art and literature and music. It enhances the experience of being human, and it addresses the questions that I'm sure you've asked about your own existence. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : And if we can get new insights into our own existence and our place in the cosmos, well, that's what happens when we attend a good play or see a good painting. It gives us a new perspective of our place in the universe. And I happen to think that is worth it for its own sake. Plus, I happen to think these ideas are among the most remarkable and astounding ideas human beings have ever come up with. And we owe it to - we scientists owe it to the people to try and explain what's happening, and I think they enhance the quality of our existence. And... IRA FLATOW, HOST : And - I'm sorry. LAWRENCE KRAUSS : ...you know, it's not just technology. I think that's what is really important. Now, of course, there are always side benefits of doing - of every time we build a new big machine like the Large Hadron Collider and push the limits of technology, we develop tools that later on are used in society. But I don't think we should justify this remarkable adventure just because of the side effects. \n\n ###",

I am Ira Flatow. A few weeks ago, we talked about the discovery of new exoplanets, those planets outside of our solar system. There were the first Earth-sized exoplanets, and we had another exoplanet smack dab in the middle of the Goldilocks Zone, you know, where liquid water could exist. That was another first. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, the planet party continues because this week, astronomers announced the discovery of the smallest exoplanet so far, again with the Kepler Space Telescope. They presented those findings at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Austin. IRA FLATOW, HOST : My next guest has been reporting on the meeting all week. He's here to tell us a few bits of news about the universe. Ron Cowen is a freelance science Writer for Nature and Science, among others, and you can find links to his stories at the meeting at sciencefriday.com. He joins us from NPR in Washington. Welcome back, Ron. RON COWEN : Thanks, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Exciting stuff? RON COWEN : Yeah, there's a lot of neat stuff. The exoplanet discovery, there's actually three new planets that - and they're all tinier than ever before, but the tiniest is about the size of Mars. All three of these guys orbit the same tiny dwarf star, and it's actually the most compact or miniature solar system we know about. RON COWEN : And none of these are in the Goldilocks Zone. They are all way too hot, too close to their parent star for liquid water to be there. But it's also interesting because all three of them are almost certainly rocky. They're tiny, so that they probably couldn't have held on to their atmosphere if they had one, but also they're so close to their parent star that the star would have - the heat from the star would have evaporated them. RON COWEN : So they're really rocky bodies, and now we can study rocky bodies, you know, similar in some ways to the ones in our own solar system. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So now that we're finding these things, we're figuring out there might be a lot of rocky planets out there. RON COWEN : Well that's right because the interesting thing is that this - these bodies were found around red dwarf stars, these are stars half to one-sixth the size of the sun. They're the most common type of star in the Milky Way. About 80 percent of the stars in the Milky Way are red dwarfs. RON COWEN : And the thinking is that if we found a few around one red dwarf - and also Kepler doesn't mostly look at red dwarfs in the first place, it looks around sun-like stars mostly. If it's already found a system like this, the astronomers are saying that our Milky Way is teeming with rocky bodies, perhaps some of them in the Goldilocks Zone. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's talk about another story at the meeting, about mapping dark matter. I thought this was really interesting, too. The largest map of dark matter ever made, that right? RON COWEN : That's right, that's right. Now dark matter, you know, is invisible. You can't see it. So you might think, well, you know, how can you map it? And it's sort of - if you - I'm going to go back to Goldilocks in a different way, Goldilocks and the three bears. I mean, if you're one of the three bears, and you didn't know Goldilocks was there, well, you saw your bed was broken, or you saw the porridge was eaten. RON COWEN : Well, dark matter, which makes up most of the mass in the universe but can't be seen, it has a gravitational tug. And according to Einstein, light from a distant object like a galaxy as it passes near one of these big, massive clumps of dark matter, will get bent, and the image will look distorted. RON COWEN : So they looked at images of 10 million galaxies across four different parts of the universe, and they statistically found a whole lot of distortions of these images. They could not account for these distortions by ordinary matter, there wasn't enough of it, so they therefore mapped the location of the dark matter, how they clump together. RON COWEN : This is important because we believe that dark matter is really what brought most of the visible mass together in the universe to form galaxies like the one we live in. So this is a way to make visible the invisible. It's also neat because dark matter is thought to be made of some exotic particles, we don't know what they're made of. The more we can at least map how they clump together and things like that is more of a clue to what they might be made of. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Does it tell us anything about that spooky dark energy stuff that's all out there? RON COWEN : This is really just about dark matter. I mean, it has to fit into the overall rubric that dark matter is a certain percentage of the mass energy of the universe, but no, this is really, as I understand it, just about dark matter itself. RON COWEN : But it's the largest one, and it's also matching what the computer simulations that theorists have done for years. So they believe they're on the right track for how the universe formed and how galaxies formed. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's always delightful when the actual facts match the theory, especially in physics. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. Thinking about a tattoo? Well, forget butterflies, unicorns or mom. Tattoos have gone geek. No more of those blurry anchors and pinup girls. We've got molecules, double-helix strands, mathematical equations all showing up on biceps and other places. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Need some inspiration for your science-themed tattoo? You can find ideas in a new book called \"Science Ink: Tattoos of the Science Obsessed,\" a collection of tattoos. You can check out some images on our website at sciencefriday.com and click on the SciArts tab on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Or you can share with Carl Zimmer. He's the author of a book here, \"Science Ink: Tattoos of the Science Obsessed.\" He's with me here in our New York studios. Thanks for coming in, Carl. CARL ZIMMER : Oh, thanks for having me. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How did the idea of science of tattoos, all these science-related tattoos, come up? CARL ZIMMER : Well, one day I just saw a scientist with a tattoo. It was a neuroscientist named Bob Data(ph) from Harvard, and he had a DNA tattoo on his shoulder, and I complimented him on it, and I said, well, I guess that makes sense because you study genes in the brain, and so it's DNA, genes, problem solved. CARL ZIMMER : And he said no, no, no, you don't understand. And he proceeded to explain to me how he had encoded his wife's initials in the DNA strand on his shoulder. And suddenly I realized that there was this whole subculture out there of very, very geeky scientific tattoos. CARL ZIMMER : And you actually have listed it - by chapters. You've got math, physics, chemistry, astronomy, Earth sciences, DNA. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We've got just about every branch of science covered here, I think. CARL ZIMMER : And they've got just about every kind of thing in these tattoos. CARL ZIMMER : I was continually surprised. I continue to be surprised. People keep emailing me these things. I probably have over 1,000 in my email inbox. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And then rich color photos of these tattoos, and some of them are mathematical equations. CARL ZIMMER : That's right. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Like some of them almost have a whole thesis on there, right? CARL ZIMMER : Some of them literally are a thesis. You know, people tend to - when they get a Ph.D., they like to celebrate, and so if they studied, say, a particular molecule, put that molecule on your body. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And some of them are very simple, but they're sort of elusive in their meaning. There's one about a trowel, and the author writes, you know, you'd think I was a biker or a mason to have a trowel on here, he says, but I'm an archeologist. That's his tool, right? CARL ZIMMER : That's right, that's right, and so any other archeologist who would look at that tattoo would know that they're the member of the same tribe. You know, this is \u2013 you know, this is something that they all use all the time. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255 if you - maybe you have a tattoo you would like to talk about or have an idea for one. So you had to basically weed out all these tattoos you couldn't use then. It must have been difficult figuring out what to keep and what not to keep. CARL ZIMMER : Well, I mean, at first I had no idea how many tattoos about science there are out there. I mean, I've talked to scientists for years now, and it never occurred to me that they were hiding tattoos from me. CARL ZIMMER : So I took a picture of this first tattoo, this DNA tattoo from Bob Data, I put it on my blog, and I just posed a question: Does anybody else out there, any other scientist have a tattoo? And immediately I started getting flooded with these images. I started putting them on my blog, and then after a while it was clear that a book was called for. CARL ZIMMER : But yeah, you know, after a while you have so many that you start to need to find a way to weed through them. \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is that reflected in your tattoo collection? CARL ZIMMER : Oh, big time, yes. There are all sorts of historical images. So for example, Charles Darwin in his notebooks, in I believe it was 1839, drew out a tree of life. This was as his theory of evolution was coming together. And so this is really an iconic image, and I got a whole bunch of tattoos of that exact reproduction of that notebook sketch on people's bodies. CARL ZIMMER : A whole bunch of evolutionary biologists have that particular tattoo. Other people have tattoos from Vasalius. There was a famous zoologist named Ernst Haeckel who drew beautiful pictures in the 1800s of all kinds of forms of life. Tons of people have Haeckel tattoos. So there's a lot of history in these pictures. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Talking with Carl Zimmer, author of \"Science Ink.\" Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Ken in Clarkesville, Tennessee. Hi, Ken, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Hi, Ken. Yes, go ahead. KEN : OK, I just wanted to give out my idea for a tattoo. They were giving free \u2013 well, not free tattoos, but before Christmas they were giving out tattoos to people who brought in toys. And that sort of made me think about it, and my idea for a tattoo is Euler's (unintelligible) atomic equation. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Euler's equation. KEN : It's E raised to the power of I times pi plus one equals zero. CARL ZIMMER : Yeah, this is - you saw - sometimes called Euler's identity. It's a beautiful, short little equation. And guess what? There are a whole bunch of people out there with that tattoo. I think I have three or four of those in the book. It's such a beautiful equation. It's so short and yet so powerful. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, Ken, thanks for - are you going to get one, Ken? KEN : Maybe next Christmas. KEN : If they still have that deal going. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, thanks for calling. Of course, Carl, your next book could be the science of how you get rid of tattoos. CARL ZIMMER : Right. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Don't you think with all these people getting tattoos that there's going to be a point where it's not a fad anymore, and people are going to be stuck? But they're so beautiful. CARL ZIMMER : Well, this is sort of a self-selected group of people who are very proud of their tattoos who send them to me. I doubt that any of these people are going to get them taken off. And in fact there are a few, you know, tenured professors, some with gray beards, who are in the book as well. You know, so you can survive to old age as a scientist and keep your tattoo intact. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to Bill in Adrian, Michigan. Hi, Bill. BILL : Hi, I'm a physician, and during my years in medicine a lot of my fellow colleagues have gotten tattoos of defibrillator paddles with a line through them to indicate that they would not want advanced life support. You know, a lot of us having been in medicine long enough and seeing the bad outcomes that happen and how, you know, how people stay on ventilators for long periods of times, we don't want that. BILL : So people will get a tattoo right there on their chest where they would put the paddle, telling people don't do that. So I just wanted to share that.

BRIAN : Hi, how's it going? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Fine, how are you? BRIAN : I'm pretty good. I had a quick question about fractal tattoos. IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK, go ahead. BRIAN : I just wanted to see if he saw any when he did the research for his book and, say, how many levels of complexity you could go to, if he's ever seen, say, a Julia set to three levels of complexity or anything of that type. CARL ZIMMER : The answer is yes. So fractals are these beautiful geometrical shapes that have - are sort of infinitely rugged, and the more you zoom in on them, the more detail you see on them. And so yes, there's this particular fractal called the Julia set. I have Julia sets sent to me. CARL ZIMMER : The question I always have is, you know, how detailed of a tattoo can you get if something is infinitively detailed? It might be a tricky thing for a tattoo. But, you know, some of these tattoos are so extraordinarily detailed that I suppose you could do it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, thanks for calling. In fact, I'm looking at one now called Mass Extinctions. It's the whole back of somebody. CARL ZIMMER : Yeah, so 65 million years ago, an asteroid slams into Earth, the dinosaurs become extinct, and so someone decided to dedicate his entire back to that cataclysmic event. And so there you go. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And also a bird-like dinosaur's head, really gorgeous tattoos. CARL ZIMMER : Yeah, yeah, a lot of people were really drawn to, say, Archaeopteryx, that classic bird-like dinosaur. And, you know, there's actually a real gorgeous dinosaur called Deinonychus, maybe one of the most beautiful tattoos in the book. Unfortunately, it's kind of reptilian scales on it. CARL ZIMMER : We know now that Deinonychus had feathers on it. So he's going to have to go in and re-inked, I think. IRA FLATOW, HOST : This is like asking, right, the question about which child is your favorite. But I'm sure you've been asked which is your favorite tattoo, and then you probably don't have a favorite, or maybe you do. CARL ZIMMER : Yeah, I page through trying to pick them, and I say, oh, I like that one; no, I like that one. I think in general I like the ones that tell you a lot about the scientist, him or herself. And some of them are funny, but some of them are quite poignant, actually. CARL ZIMMER : So just to give you one example, there's a neuroscientist named Lindsey Reese(ph) who has a neuron on her foot. Now, that might seem obvious to you, but there's a deeper story there. It's a particular kind of neuron that we use to send messages to our body to move our bodies around. That's the kind of neuron that dies when people get Lou Gehrig's disease. CARL ZIMMER : So this woman's father actually died of Lou Gehrig's when she was 18, and that's what made her decide to become a neuroscientist. So this tattoo is really about her loss, her life and her science all in one. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I have to ask this question because I know people have asked me: Are there tattoos or places on the body you could not put in your book that were tattooed? \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : On our Video Pick of the Week up on our website, the bubble computer. It's fascinating to watch the bubbles go through these little tubes. And they're all spaced out quite evenly in the tubes. And they go through little mazes and touch each other and push each other around, and... FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : And you might be thinking, you know, well, why? Bubbles, obviously, are a lot slower than electrons. IRA FLATOW, HOST : A little bit. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : So you're not going to be doing like your iPhone, you know, Yelping from your bubble computer. And they're really big compared to electrons, but they have this added advantage that electrons don't have. They're, like, little, teeny-tiny test tubes. They can carry things with them.

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : And they went - and they move very quickly when they explode. So it is fun to watch. It was fun to shoot, too. IRA FLATOW, HOST : It's - maybe - we should do more of these tiny, little macros. FLORA LICHTMAN, BYLINE : Yeah. If you have suggestions for tiny things you'd like to see - we were talking about maybe how the eye responds to when you turn the light on and off or... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right.

I'm Neal Conan. Events are planned in cities across the country on this holiday to mark the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. This morning, riders boarded the Freedom Train into San Francisco to commemorate this historic march in 1965 from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery. In Atlanta, where King was born, cellist Yo-Yo Ma is scheduled to perform at Morehouse College, King's alma mater. Later tonight, President Obama and the first lady are expected at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., for the annual Let Freedom Ring celebration. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Many other's visited the new King memorial on the National Mall, and millions around the country took part in a national day of service. Every year on this program, we return to the march on Washington and probably King's most famous speech. Here's Martin Luther King Jr., August 28, 1963, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. NEAL CONAN, HOST : MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. And five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : My Lord. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : JR.: One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later... UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : My Lord. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : JR.: ...the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence... UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : JR.: ...they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : My Lord. Sure enough. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : JR.: We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN : It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end but a beginning. And those who hoped that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : The marvelous new militancy, which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating for whites only. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering, continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our Northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold, which leads into the palace of justice : I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  In the past, changes in campaign finance laws yielded slightly different presidential elections every four years, but 2012 is the first since the Supreme Court decision transformed the playing field. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Political donations are now considered free speech. Donations to candidates are still limited, but corporations and unions can give as much as they like to so-called super PACs, which unleashed blizzards of attack ads in Iowa, New Hampshire and now in South Carolina. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Critics worry that we've crossed a threshold into an ever nastier political climate. Proponents argue that more ads allow voters to make more informed choices. If you've donated to a super PAC, call and tell us why. Our phone number is 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Go to npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, Thomas Pickering joins us on the Opinion Page to argue the case for diplomacy with Iran, but first Ted Koppel joins us from our bureau in New York. He's a commentator for NPR News and a special correspondent for MSNBC's \"Rock Center with Brian Williams,\" which airs his piece on super PACs tonight. And Ted, welcome back. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Actually, it's not MSNBC, it's plain old NBC. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I was just looking at that. Thanks very much for the correction. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Nice to be with you, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And is it just the number of ads that's different this year? TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Well, certainly volume is huge, but you just heard at the top of the news Governor Huntsman bemoaning the fact that things have gotten so nasty and that they're going to get even nastier. I must tell you if you think things are bad now, just wait until the general election. Wait until the Democrats and the Republicans start unleashing these quite literally hundreds of millions of dollars that will be put to work in large measure putting out negative ads. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I have to say, Ted, this is not the first time we've seen negative advertising. As the old expression goes, politics ain't beanbag, negative ads are part of the game. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Negative ads are part of the game, but I think what you have these days is if, in the old days you could say that candidates were responsible, remember how a candidate would say at the end of each ad I'm Ted Koppel and I'm responsible for this message, you're not hearing that anymore because the fact of the matter is the campaigns - while the campaigns are still putting out ads, and you'll still hear a candidate say that, in South Carolina now, for example, at a rate exceeding two to one, it is the super PACs that are putting out these messages. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : And if in the old days you could say that candidates bore some responsibility, now we live in an era of irresponsibility because not only are the candidates not responsible, they can take the position that they are not permitted under the law to communicate directly with the super PACs that are supporting them. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : And so they can stand back and watch as the super PACs quite literally mug the other candidate, and it's going to lead - it's going to reach a level of nastiness, Neal, that I think we haven't seen in many, many years. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Just a clarification, at the top of the show we played a clip of tape of Mitt Romney on MSNBC - that one was correct - but he was responding to Newt Gingrich's protest: Mr. Romney, stop these ads, take them off the air, it's just negative advertising. He could say, with I guess plausible deniability, I have no control over this super PAC. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : He could, and the irony is that of course now Newt Romney several days ago got a donation... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Newt Gingrich. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Newt Gingrich, I'm sorry - Newt Romney is - that's not likely to happen. Newt Gingrich got a donation of $5 million from a man by the name of Sheldon Adelson, who is a casino owner in Las Vegas and apparently has enough money that giving $5 million is no big deal to him. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : But with that $5 million, Gingrich was able to start striking back in South Carolina. And Gingrich wasn't, his super PAC was. NEAL CONAN, HOST : His super PAC, as you're about to clarify that. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Red, White and Blue. Yes, Red, White and Blue struck back by purchasing a documentary that had been done, interestingly enough, by a filmmaker on spec. He made the video in anticipation of selling it to some political adversary to Mitt Romney. And in fact, it was Newt Gingrich's super PAC that purchased it and is now playing segments of it. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : And newspaper reporters who have specialized in this kind of thing have analyzed it. The Washington Post gave it a four Pinocchio, which is their highest, or lowest depending on how you choose to look at it, rating for honesty. And Newt Gingrich came out and said look, I think this is terrible, and I think they ought to correct all the errors, and if they can't correct all the errors, they ought to take it off the air. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : As best I can determine, the ads are still on the air because the super PACs are taking the position that Newt Romney can't communicate with us directly, and we're not listening to what he says on TV. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You did it again, Ted: Newt Gingrich. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Newt Gingrich. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Easily done. There is something else to point out: Yes, this is a new world, super PACs are new, 527s it was not too long ago and swift-boating, I think, well, what's the difference between what we're seeing and those kinds of ads that, you'll forgive me, did a lot to scupper the campaign of John Kerry? TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Yes, you're absolutely right. Technically speaking, there is a distinction, and that is in those days you had to - they were called issue ads. You had to have an issue. The issue in this case was whether or not Senator Kerry, while he was serving as a commander of a swift boat in Vietnam, had literally participated in the acts of bravery for which he won the Silver Star. That was the issue. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : The fact that undermining that story also undermined his campaign was regarded, at least under the law, as being a technicality. A, these days you can go after the other candidate, and you can do it directly; B, it's a question of volume. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : I spoke to a man who gave a little bit more than a million dollars to Senator Santorum's super PAC, and again forgive me if I say Senator Santorum's super PAC, he doesn't own it, he doesn't control it, but it is a super PAC that supports him. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : So this man, Mr. Weiss(ph), gave over a million dollars, and when I asked him about it, he said well, there's, you know, there's a great convenience factor. In the old days, he said, what we used to do, what we used to have to do, is I'd invite seven or eight people and ask each of them to invite seven or eight people, and each of them would then come, we'd have a draw, he said, like Dick Cheney, and we'd serve whiskey and peanuts, and each person could donate only $2,500. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Now that's an interesting point, he said. So it wasn't very easy to raise huge sums of money. He, independently now, has been able to give over a million dollars. What's the point? Theoretically, limiting the donation of each individual to $2,500 during the primaries and $2,500 during a general election was supposed to limit corruption in politics. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : If indeed - and that's still the case. You can't give more than $2,500 to a candidate. But you can now give a million, five million, 10 million. It is anticipated that the Romney super PAC will have about $300 to $350 million in play before this election is over. That's something of a whole new dimension. NEAL CONAN, HOST : They say the Obama super PAC will have a billion. The president denies it, but we'll be up in those large numbers in any case. But we want to get some... TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : It's actually Republicans who are saying that. I haven't heard any Democrats saying that the president's going to have a super PAC, but believe me, he'll have hundreds of millions of dollars at the disposal of those super PACs, and the super PACs almost by definition tend to go negative. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from you about how these super PACs are changing the political climate, if they are, and we'd like to hear especially from those of you who have made a contribution to one, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. We'll start with Nicole(ph), an Nicole's on the line with us from San Antonio. NICOLE : Hi, I teach advertising in one of my classes, and I take issue with an idea presented at the top of the show, which was that more advertising leads to a more informed electorate, potentially. I think that specifically the reason I have not donated to a super PAC, and I am a political - I do contribute, but not to super PACs because I don't feel like my money is going to go to making the audience more informed, I feel like it's going to go to more misinformation and propaganda and a less informed electorate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, for example, in South Carolina, the super PAC aligned with Newt Gingrich is running ads that try to inform the voters of South Carolina about Mr. Romney's past as an executive with Bain, a venture capital firm, and whether - it portrays that very negatively, but nevertheless, maybe a lot of voters didn't know that. NICOLE : Sure, and I think that there is definitely a place for advertising to exist. I just don't think that more advertising always means more information. Sometimes it just means more screaming. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ted Koppel, you've probably seen a lot of these ads. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Yeah, and in fact, I raised the issue, we went to an advertising agency here in New York and raised the issue with the lady who was the CEO of that ad, and the question that we put to her was this: Why is it that products don't engage in negative advertising? Why is it that products don't go after each other with the same vehemence that politicians do? \n\n ###",

Number one, she said, the products, you know, are around for a very long time, and therefore what you try to do is you try to build up good feelings in the public about the product, and you don't want to get engaged in the sort of negative mudslinging. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Alternatively, she pointed out that politics tend to be, these elections tend to be short-term operations, just for a few months, and the object is to get to the White House. Secondly, she said, the FTC, that is the Federal Trade Commission, is far more demanding that you tell the truth in your ads for a loaf of bread than the Federal Election Commission is with regard to the ads because political advertising is covered under the First Amendment, therefore you can say almost anything you want in these super PAC ads.

When we return, we'll speak with Cleta Mitchell, the campaign finance lawyer who represents Republican candidates and parties. Her clients include one of the super PACs that supports Texas Governor Rick Perry. So we'll hear the other side of the argument. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. Last week, Senator John McCain blasted the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, calling it the worst decision in last 50 years and blamed it for the ad wars we're seeing now. That Supreme Court decision struck down large portions of the McCain-Feingold law of 2002, which established contribution limits, now out the window for corporations and unions who want to donate to super PACs. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you've made a donation to a super PAC, we'd like to know why. We'd also like to hear from those of you to think about - to ask us about how super PACs are changing the political climate, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. NPR commentator Ted Koppel is with us today, and joining us now is Cleta Mitchell, a longtime campaign finance attorney. She worked on a team opposing the McCain-Feingold law. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And her current clients include the Make Us Great Again super PAC, which is aligned with Texas Governor Rick Perry. And Cleta Mitchell joins us here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for coming in on the holiday. CLETA MITCHELL : Thank you for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so is this entirely negative, terrible things, or is this free speech? CLETA MITCHELL : Well, it is free speech, and the Supreme Court, that's not new. The Supreme Court said in January of 1976, in the Buckley vs. Valeo decision, that the right of citizens to make independent expenditures and for campaigns to spend money is protected under the First Amendment, that money is speech. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, they considerably expanded it in Citizens United. CLETA MITCHELL : Well, that's actually not true. I mean, what happened was that there had been intervening decisions, one in 1979, in which the Supreme Court, I think, had gotten it wrong in a decision saying that a corporation could not - could be precluded under state law from making independent expenditures. CLETA MITCHELL : And from that came several other decisions, including the decision in the Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court upheld McCain-Feingold, in the McConnell decision, relying on that 1979 case. And essentially what happened was that with a case in 2004 involving the Wisconsin right-to-life organization, the Supreme Court said, well, actually as applied - the facts applied to this case, you know, gee, it is unconstitutional to say that this citizens group can't make independent expenditures and electionary communications just before an election. CLETA MITCHELL : And then when Citizens United came along a couple years later, the Supreme Court said, now, wait a minute, we need to go back and look at our - that 1979 decision. And what the Supreme Court said was that that was the anomaly, and it basically went back to the decision in 1976. CLETA MITCHELL : So I mean, I listen to all of this debate and argument. I listened to Ted Koppel, who frankly is a household word, name - his name is a household word because, because he has spent his career being able to say what he wants on - in a system where a corporation, ABC News and now NBC, is able to spend unlimited amounts promoting Ted Koppel's ideas. CLETA MITCHELL : This show we're on right now, NPR is owned and operated by a corporation, and what the Supreme Court said was that for Congress to say that media corporations should be able to spend unlimited amounts saying whatever they want or their hosts and their commentators can say whatever they want, but other corporations are not allowed to make similar kinds of expenditures is tantamount to Congress granting a speech license, which the First Amendment doesn't allow. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ted Koppel, free speech? TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Free speech indeed. I know that Ms. Mitchell is aware of the fact that it's not quite as simple as she portrays it. We are obliged, at least I'm obliged, as a journalist, and have tried to abide by that over the years, to include something that is not required under the Citizens United ruling, and that is accuracy. \n\n ###",

If for some reason I say something that is inaccurate, A) I can be sued, and B) I'd probably lose my job. And I must tell you that those who worked for me at ABC and at \"Nightline\" over the years, they might get one pass, they wouldn't get two.

I deal in these nuances and these regulations all the time, all day every day, and let me just tell you that candidate speech is protected from any kind of interference in its content.

TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : If you will at least allow me to quote my source, it was one of the commissioners of the FEC whom you will see on NBC tonight at 10:00, making precisely that statement, that the largest fine that has been collected by the FEC in recent years has been $100,000. CLETA MITCHELL : Well, that's not true. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : And when you are - and when you are in fact collecting tens of millions of dollars, that's considered to be the price of doing business. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll accept that we need to disagree on this point... CLETA MITCHELL : Well, you know, the fact is that the Media Fund, for example, in 2004 raised and spent $60 million; 90 percent of that was from labor unions and corporations and donors over $5,000. They were supporting John Kerry, and they paid a fine of $580,000. Do I think that they calculated and said, yes, that's just a cost of doing business? Yes. CLETA MITCHELL : But let me go back to this, because I think it's important that you do have your facts correct, and they are not correct. For instance, the TV stations are responsible for monitoring and taking down inaccurate ads by organizations such as super PACs, but I've spent a fair amount of time the last several years trying to get inaccurate ads taken off the air and demonstrating, with documentation, inaccuracies, because the law is that the station - a broadcast licensee has a responsibility to take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of such advertising. CLETA MITCHELL : Since the economy tanked, you can't get an ad off the air, because they need the money. But you would - those ads, the ad makers, those who pay for the ads and the station are all - they could be sued for libel. But the FEC doesn't monitor this. This is not an FEC issue. It is an FCC issue. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : And the FCC, if anything, is an even weaker organization than the FEC. But let's... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get a caller in on the conversation here. This is TALK OF THE NATION, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Let's go next to Cathy(ph), Cathy with us from St. Clair Shores in Michigan. CATHY : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, you're on the air.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### CATHY : Yesterday I made my second donation to Stephen Colbert's super PAC. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK. CATHY : And I'd appreciate your comments about Mr. Colbert's use of the super PAC to educate the public. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That is another technique. This is, of course, the faux newscaster from the Comedy Central channel who is running a mock campaign, I guess, or semi-mock campaign in South Carolina and using that campaign as an educational tool. Ted, have you seen his contributions here? TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : I've not only seen them, I have an interview that runs separately on \"Rock Center\" tonight with Stephen on the subject. And I must give him a shout-out at this particular point because I think he has done more through his satire of underscoring and educating the American public on the ludicrous nature of these super PACs. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : I mean, as you probably know, or as many of your listeners have probably heard, he has - he has collected hundreds - I mean, I don't know how many thousands of donations, and he won't tell me how much money he has collected because, as he correctly points out, he doesn't have to yet, but he now has handed over control of his super PAC to his friend Jon Stewart so that he can run for president of South Carolina, at least he has an exploratory commission in that direction. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : But I think Colbert's mockery of what can be done - and he actually applied for and got permission to form his own super PAC, has been receiving donations for that super PAC, has done ads on the air, he did one ad in fact making fun of Ms. Mitchell's client, Governor Perry, in which he asked voters, I guess in Iowa, to vote for, what, Governor Perry with an A? There's nothing that anybody could do about it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And by the way, we have checked, and there was a $580,000 fine imposed against the Media Fund in the Kerry campaign. So that is accurate. And so it's a lot more than $100,000, Ted. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Well, I stand corrected then, but you will still see the same commissioner making that statement tonight. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As - Cleta Mitchell, the other claim, that these groups are independent, it's clear when you nominate the - when the person who ran, for example, Governor Romney's campaign four years ago, is the head of a super PAC, does any - there is no outright coordination. But there's no - it's clear to everybody that this super PAC is working for Mitt Romney. CLETA MITCHELL : Well, that's what they - I'm sure that's what they say in their statement of organization filed with the FEC. You have to say what the purpose of any political committee is when you form it. And that's, I'm sure, exactly what they say, that they're supporting the presidential nomination of Mitt Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And wink, wink, nod, nod. CLETA MITCHELL : Well, not wink, wink, nod, nod. NEAL CONAN, HOST : No. Well, except that these groups run negative ads against the other side, the guy's opponents. CLETA MITCHELL : Or they run positive ads in support of their candidate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For the most part, they have thus been - thus far been negative ads overwhelmingly. And the campaign is, therefore, able to run commercials, ads, saying - showing the candidate kissing baby and shaking hands. CLETA MITCHELL : Well, I don't know that that's true, and I think it would be important that that'd be analyzed. And look, I'll tell you who taught us how to do all of this, was George Soros and Ellen Malcolm and the people in 2004 who went out and formed America Coming Together and the Media Fund and got $20 million from George Soros for Americans Coming Together. They raised and spent $200 million in 2004, all independent of the Kerry campaign. The Media Fund raised and spent $60 million. You had unions giving money, which was illegal we thought at that time. And so I didn't hear all of this outrage about that. I didn't hear the liberal media and Ted Koppel. I looked this morning, Mr. Koppel, and I didn't see any outrage on your part when George Soros called George Bush a Nazi. CLETA MITCHELL : I mean, the fact of the matter is, we - as you said at the outset, Neal, politics ain't bean bag. And the reason people do negative ads is because they work. And, you know, I don't know if this segment is about negative ads. That's a subject. I don't know if it's about super PACs. I don't know if it's about Citizens United, because you're throwing all of this into a stew pot. Basically, what I hear people is saying, what I hear the media is saying is since Citizens United and conservative donors basically having sat out 2006 and 2008, who got back into the ballgame in 2010 and are back in the ballgame in 2012, that now there's outrage. There was no outrage that I saw in 2006 and 2008, or really in 2004. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking about super PACs. Our guest - you just heard Cleta Mitchell, who's a campaign finance lawyer. Her clients include one of the super PACs that supports Texas Governor Rick Perry, Make Us Great Again. Also with us, NPR commentator Ted Koppel, whose piece on super PACs airs tonight on NBC's \"Rock Center with Brian Williams.\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And Ted, I heard you wanting to get back in there. TED KOPPEL, BYLINE : Well, I just wanted to respond. I think you're being a little too modest in terms of conservative contributions to all of this. Karl Rove, I think, set the tone long ago. And, in fact, Carl Forte(ph), the man who is now one of those heading up the Mitt Romney super PAC, was responsible, among others, for the Willie Horton ad against Dukakis, which as I recall, that campaign was back, what, in the late '80s? So this has been going on for a very, very long time. But if the point you want to raise is that liberal super PACs are going to be just as nasty as conservative super PACs, I concede the point. My objection is to the super PACs, not to what is being said specifically by anyone of the ads. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. Up next, \"Confessions of a Surgeon.\" Have you ever sat in your doctor's office, you know, doctor's going down that long list of aches and pains, and have you ever thought to yourself: I wonder if he's really listening to me. Well, at least one doctor has confessed to not always paying attention to what his patients say. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That revelation is just one of the many secrets spilled in a new book, \"Confessions of a Surgeon.\" I think we need music to wail up on - \"Confessions of a Surgeon.\" And then the book is by surgeon Paul Ruggieri. He takes us behind the operating room doors, a place many of us have been but a few of us know much about because, you know, once you get in there and you start counting backwards, the lights are out, and you don't know what's happening. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, this book is eye-opening, and at times it's actually brutally honest in looking at what it's like to be a surgeon. Paul Ruggieri is a surgeon in private practice in Rhode Island. \"Confessions of a Surgeon: The Good, the Bad, and the Complicated: Life Behind the OR Doors.\" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Paul. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DR. PAUL RUGGIERI: Thank you, thank you very much. Just to correct one thing, I practice in Massachusetts. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Oh, you've moved. RUGGIERI : No, I didn't move. Massachusetts. IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK, we'll get that right. And this is an example of - you are brutally honest in your book. You know, you talk about your mistakes, your worries about malpractice, making your mortgage. Why are you willing to confess when other doctors are not? RUGGIERI : Well, I've been wanting to write this book for a very long time. I want to give people an honest view of what I do and what many like me do on a daily basis. And it finally came to fruition. Surgeons are human beings. I wanted to educate the public that we are human beings. RUGGIERI : And we're put often in extraordinary circumstances, to make life-and-death decisions quickly, and we have to. We have to do something. And this is - this is our job every day. This is what we face. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So you, like in any profession, you make mistakes. RUGGIERI : Correct, as a human I'm imperfect. I'm not perfect every day. As much as I would like to be, because I know when I'm not perfect, people get hurt. People suffer. But we strive to be perfect, and most of us are perfect every day. That's the beauty of it. Surgery is so safe in this country, and most of us are perfect every day, and we have to be. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is the surgeon that we're likely to face if we need surgery, you know, one of  these storybook celebrity surgeons, or are they going to be just sort of a middle, average surgeon? RUGGIERI : Most of us are regular people who are dedicated to what we do. I mean, we have families. We have hobbies. Most of us are regular people who are dedicated to our profession. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You talk in your book, let's talk about some of the things that you mention in your book. You talk very openly about a mistake you made. You were taking out a colon cancer, and when you stitched the person back together, there was a problem. Take us through that. RUGGIERI : As far as the stapling device that's required or... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. RUGGIERI : That incident? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. RUGGIERI : Well, yes, as we do colon resections, we usually connect the colon together with a stapling device, and we rely on medical instruments every day to what we - what I do. And most surgeons do. And they have to be perfect as well, just like us. And if they're not, we have to recognize that, and we have to correct that. RUGGIERI : And once we - when they're not perfect, and we don't recognize that \u2013 again, patients suffer. \n\n ###",

Also you can tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I. Here's a question from Tom Beauchamp(ph). He says: Why do some patients regain awareness during the operation? How can that be detected earlier? RUGGIERI : Well, actually, some patients not wake up, but the anesthesia may wear off somewhat, and during the operation they may sense something, sense an awareness. It doesn't last, it's very fleeting. I'm assuming that's what he means. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You also mentioned in your book that sometimes you as a surgeon have to clean up virtually a mess made by another surgeon while the operation is still going on. RUGGIERI : Well, there are times when other surgeons get into trouble. I've been into trouble myself, and I've had to call for help. And you have to help the other surgeon because the patient is the most important factor here. No matter what's been done, you have to do your best to go in there and help. We've all been there. Every one of us has been there. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, why are these doctors, if they're incompetent, why are they still practicing medicine and especially surgery? RUGGIERI : Well, I wouldn't say they're incompetent. Most surgeons are very competent. Most surgeons are very competent individuals, and occasionally we get into trouble. Again, I have been there, for whatever reason, for the anatomy, for the emergency of it, and we need help sometimes. RUGGIERI : The really incompetent ones are weeded out. They are. We're doing a much better job of policing our own today. We haven't in the past. I'll be the first to admit that. But things are much better now, in the last decade particularly. It's like any profession, like any profession. IRA FLATOW, HOST : When you were chief of surgery, you had to make a decision to take away the privileges of another surgeon at the hospital though. Isn't that correct? RUGGIERI : Well, I had to make a decision whether to sign his privileges. And I could live with that. I could not do that. I had to do the right thing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What was wrong with that other surgeon? RUGGIERI : It was a culmination of operations and his outcomes, and somebody had to take a stand. I mean, I was in a position of authority. I had to notify people, and I did. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is there sort of a white book, a white code of honor for surgeons like there is a blue for policemen? RUGGIERI : Well, again, I think any profession, there's a reluctance to speak out against a colleague for a lot of reasons. One is you think nobody will listen to you. Nobody wants to stick their neck out. It's like any profession. Mine is no different. I think it's a cultural thing that's been pervasive in most professions. It's much better today, again, than it has been in the past, much better, and there's more transparency in medicine than there's ever been before. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But you talk in your book about how there's really not a good way to know how good a surgeon is. A lot of the records aren't public. RUGGIERI : That's true. I mean, part of the reason - another part of the reason I wrote this book is to educate the public. They need to be active in really researching who their surgeon is and ask pointed, specific questions about their experience. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And who do you - do you ask it of the surgeon? Is there a database? Or who do you ask this question? RUGGIERI : Well, I would actually start with the internist who's going to refer you to a surgeon. You normally see a primary doctor, for whatever the reason is, and they're going to refer you to a surgeon. I would start there. Like why are you referring me to this surgeon? Do you have confidence in this surgeon? Do you have experience with this surgeon? RUGGIERI : And then once you get to the surgeon's office, there are some questions you can ask about the surgeon's experience, as far as the number of operations he or she has done. Have you had complications with this surgery? Is this a new operation that you're doing? There are other things that you can ask. RUGGIERI : But as far as researching on a database (unintelligible) that there's very few informational sites that you can go to. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Here's a question from Jennifer Thompson(ph), who's already has surgery scheduled and wants to know what are a couple of questions that patients should or need to ask that they typically don't ask. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### RUGGIERI : Well, first of all, I mean, when you sit in front of a surgeon, you want to know what's my diagnosis, and why do I need surgery. And who's going to be doing it. And if I don't need surgery, what are the alternatives? And then once you decide I do need an operation, what is your operative plan? What do you plan to do to me? How will it affect me once you do whatever you do? And then, again, what's my recovery going to be? RUGGIERI : And with this specific operation, what is the most common complication that you've come across, and how have you dealt with it? I mean, those are the kind of pointed questions you can ask about your upcoming operation. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Should you - are there times where you go in with your surgeon, but your surgeon doesn't actually do the operation? RUGGIERI : No, there aren't. I mean, I'm in private practice. It's me. I'm the one doing the surgery. Most private practice surgeons, that's how we operate. At academic centers, there's attending surgeons, they are teaching residents how to operate there. They're constantly monitoring the resident who is doing part of the operation. There's always supervision, but I've never heard of an instance where, no, you go into an operation, somebody else is doing it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : No med student's going to take over learning on your body, something like that? RUGGIERI : I doubt it, unless the surgeon passes out. But I don't think that's going to happen. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Have you ever heard of a surgeon passing out? RUGGIERI : No, not particularly, I have not, but most surgeons are the ones doing the surgery that you see. It should be that way. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How long does it take to become a really good surgeon, how many years? RUGGIERI : Well, that's a good question, actually, because we all train for at least five years. Some go beyond that, seven, 10 years. So when you're done with your training, you're officially stamped as a safe, competent surgeon. But in reality, when you get out there in the real world, in private practice, I mean you're on your own. For the first time you're on your own. RUGGIERI : And there's an old saying in surgery which really is true: The first 10 years when you're in practice, you really learn how to operate. I mean, you do know how to operate, but you're getting the finer details, becoming more confident. The next 10 years, you know when to operate. You manage to get the judgment on deciding when to operate in tough situations. RUGGIERI : And the last 10 years, which is probably the most important, is you when know not to operate, because what I do, if I have to operate on somebody, I mean, sure, I can help them very much, but I could also hurt them very much. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And are you willing to not do the surgery? Because we hear stories of what do surgeons do - they surge - they operate. And so if you go to a surgeon, they're going to say you need an operation when you might not need one. RUGGIERI : Well, most surgeons I know, if you truly do need an operation, there's a truly good indication for it, they will offer that to you. I don't know many surgeons who just operate just because they want to operate. I mean, they're out there, I'm sure. But if you truly need an operation and there's a good indication for it, a surgeon will recommend that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Let's go to... RUGGIERI : I would recommend getting a second opinion if you have any questions about it, even a third opinion. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. What's the biggest misconception people have about surgeons and surgery? RUGGIERI : Well, I think there's a - there's still a very thick wall between surgeons and patients. I think patients are afraid of their surgeon, afraid to ask questions. I think they're afraid to ask for a second opinion. I think patients need to become more active. They're going to find out they we're very receptive to this. We want patients to ask questions. We want them to be actively involved in their upcoming operation and thinking about their upcoming operation, because we want them to be realistic about their outcomes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, I think patients feel that, you know, surgeons are so - they're educated. They're surgeons. They're doctors, and they have - some of them have an attitude about being a surgeon, and they're just fearful, you know. So... RUGGIERI : Yes, I agree. Some of us do have an attitude, and that needs to change. It's changing. But I think there's more transparency in medicine today, and people are becoming more aware of what they need to ask their doctors - not just their surgeon, but the regular doctors as well. They need to become more actively involved in their care, particularly surgery. \n\n ###",

Talking with Paul Ruggieri, author of \"Confessions of a Surgeon: The Good, the Bad, and the Complicated...Life Behind the O.R. Doors.\" Let's go to David in Dayton, Ohio. Hi, David. DAVID : Hello. Dr. Ruggieri, I just read your article about informed consent, and that's an article that I found very important to me. I had surgery at the Cleveland Clinic about four years ago. The surgeon promised to do my surgery. I actually put on the consent form that only he was authorized to do my surgery. And I found out when I did not recover and suffered multiple injuries that residents were involved in doing most of my surgery. I also learned that this doctor, who's head of a department, was denied of medical license in Iowa and was not given his board certification. DAVID : I'm unable to break through any barrier to find out what his credentials are, what happened during my surgery. And I learned that there's a whole cluster of patients - many of them contacted me - too, who suffered life-threatening injuries. One fellow three months in the hospital after his surgery, underwent five additional surgeries for reconstruction of his bowel. And I'm just wondering what a patient can do. I've run into a through a brick wall with CMS... IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK. Let me - let's get an answer because we're running out of time. Dr. Ruggieri? DAVID : OK. RUGGIERI : Yeah, I understand. I completely understand that. I mean, I'm in private practice. I'm the one doing the operating, and there are no residents. And academic centers who - must know that residents may be participating in part of their operation. That's a fact. And if you don't want to be involved in resident care, then you shouldn't go to an academic center. But there is. There's still a big wall between what patients come to find out about the quality and qualifications of their surgeon, and that needs to change. And I'm hoping this book adds to that. But it's a very difficult situation from a patient's standpoint. I agree. IRA FLATOW, HOST : This SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Dr. Paul A. Ruggieri, author of \"Confessions of a Surgeon.\" So you don't have any concrete answers to give him about how to find out the information he's looking for. RUGGIERI : Well, I think what he can do is actually contact the hospital specifically and ask to speak to the department of surgery chairman. I think you'd find that chairman to be very receptive to talking to you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Aren't his records - doesn't he not own his own records of the surgery? RUGGIERI : Oh, yes. He can go in and request (unintelligible), correct. He can request his own medical records to find out actually what was done. It sounds like he found out after the fact that residents did operate - did do part of his operation. So he could definitely do that. Those are his records. He can go and request copies of those records. He needs somebody to interpret them for him, though. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. You've been around a long time. You watched bodies change. You've seen this - what we, you know, this outbreak of obesity. Does that affect how you do surgery? RUGGIERI : No doubt. We're seeing patients today who are thicker, more obese, with more advanced disease that we take into the operating room. And it's - it puts them at risk for complications after the surgery. That's a known fact. That's in the medical literature. It makes our job harder, physically, to do whatever we have to do, whether it's in the chest, the abdomen, wherever. And that's a problem. That's going to be a continued problem in this country. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. See if can get a quick call in before we have to go. Dominic in Los Angeles. Hi, Dom. DOMINIC : Good afternoon. I'm a trauma surgeon. I work in one of the large trauma centers in the country, and my brother is thoracic surgeon. And on any given Friday night, I probably do more surgeries in an eight-hour shift than he does in a month. And most of our patients are referred to as victims. We get gunshots, stabbings, suicides by the dozens. And I'm sure we deal with our patients a lot differently than your guest does. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And what's - have you got a point or question about that, that you want to make? DOMINIC : Well, only that trauma surgery is a specialty now, and the number of surgeries that we do, the greater number of them save people's lives. We take pride in the fact that we lose very few of our victims. It's a severe trauma, and it has become a state-of-the-art type of situation. In the past, before there were certified trauma centers, there were emergency rooms. And they would take doctors off the floor who may have been eye, ear, nose and throat to handle an emergency case. And it has developed considerably in the last 25 years. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Thanks for calling. Our number: 1... RUGGIERI : Yeah. I agree totally. I agree totally with that statement. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. Surgeons are now more specialized and getting called when they need to be. We're going to take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk more about surgery.

I guess one of the most difficult things of - part of being a doctor is dealing with the patient and the relatives and bringing bad news to patients, not just that maybe the outcome wasn't what you expected, but maybe that you made a mistake in surgery. RUGGIERI : Oh, there's no question. It's very difficult on that front, and the other front, bad news, bringing somebody news that they have cancer. I mean, the stories in my book, particularly one - well, two actually. One is I explored a gentleman who was having abdominal problems, and got in there and found there was cancer everywhere. The family really didn't expect that, and I had to come out and tell the family that this is what I found. It was a very big shock to them. They weren't prepared for that. And it is very difficult to do, but you have to be honest with patients. I believe you really have to be honest, particularly up front, in the beginning, especially if the operation didn't go well and there was a problem with something that you did. You need to be honest with patients. Let them know. Patients respect honesty. They really do. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you must develop some sort of distance, though, when somebody is on that operating table, you're - and you mentioned this in the book, there's no real personal connection to that person. And... RUGGIERI : That's correct. I believe - this is the way I have to be. I think many like me are the same way, in the operating room, focused on what we're doing. We have to be, particularly in an emergency situation, when someone's bleeding from a ruptured spleen. You really can't think about anything else. You have to think about what you're doing, and quickly. Then once things are under control, then you can relax a little bit. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And you have to be good at improvising, you mention in your book. RUGGIERI : Exactly. That is - and that comes with experience. That comes with experience. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Because you always go in there thinking something is going to go wrong and be ready for it. RUGGIERI : Well, we do. I mean, it's not - I do. I do that, especially with emergency settings where I have to operate on somebody, not knowing what's going in the patient's abdomen. You have to expect the worst. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And are you trained for that in med school? RUGGIERI : Not in med school, no. Residency, you are. You should be trained to deal with that when you come out of residency. But the reality is you need experience. You need some years under your belt, because you don't experience everything in residency. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Right. So if you're, quote-unquote, \"shopping for a surgeon,\" how many years of experience do you want in that surgeon? RUGGIERI : Well, there are data out there that shows surgeons who have experience in certain type of operations are better at them. That's been proven in several major surgeries and surgery centers. I mean, it depends what operation you're looking for, as well, what operation you need to have done. People coming out of residency are qualified. They are very qualified to do what they need to do. The problem is they need more experience to know what their limitations are, and you gain that experience. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Do you have music in your theater there? RUGGIERI : I do, on occasion - not every day. I'll grab a CD on the way out the door, you know, depending on how I feel. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And while you're - if you're doing routine surgery, are you thinking about picking up dinner that night while, you know, you're working on somebody? RUGGIERI : Not dinner, no. \n\n ###",

RUGGIERI : Not dinner. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's the wrong thing. I mean, but you're thinking of other things that may be on your mind. RUGGIERI : Oh, you really not. You're - I mean, routine - most operations are very boring and routine. That's the great thing about what I do, too, and that's great. Boring routine is perfect. So, you know, you're concentrating on what you're doing, and usually it goes well. And - but you do think about other things after a critical part of the operation, maybe down to your closing and everything's done. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to the phones: 1-800-989-8255. Robert in Grass Valley, California. Hi, Robert. ROBERT : Hi. How are you today? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi, there. ROBERT : Good. Just a suggestion, to possibly speak to the OR nurses just to get a suggestion on who they would have to have perform surgeries, since they cannot tell you who they would not have perform the surgery. Thank you. RUGGIERI : That's a fantastic suggestion, no question. That is a fantastic suggestion, if you know an operating room nurse or know somebody who works in an operating room where you're going to have surgery. IRA FLATOW, HOST : That's right. At least you can sort of weed out people you don't want rather than getting the best person's recommendation. So word of mouth is a good way to find out. RUGGIERI : I agree. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. And doctors don't advertise they're great surgeons, or they do sometimes. Do you disrespect people who do a lot of advertising? RUGGIERI : I don't, but it's rarely done, to be honest. We don't. It's not in our nature. It just is not. Maybe we should do more advertising, but we don't. Most surgeons are very quiet individuals. They let their work speak for themselves. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Let's go to Cathy(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Cathy. CATHY : Hi. This is a fascinating conversation for me. I'm a former O.R. nurse. And there are all kinds of things I would love to comment on, but the one thing I haven't heard mentioned, which I think is critically important and that the general public doesn't realize, is that when you are having surgery, there is more than one physician in the room. There's your surgeon, but there's also the person who is keeping you alive, known as the anesthesiologist. And while people will invest time in finding out who's doing their surgery, nine times out of 10, they don't have a clue who's going to be keeping them alive while they're having that surgery, and that's the job of the anesthesiologist. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Interesting point. Doctor, a comment? RUGGIERI : That's an excellent point. And I address that a little bit in my book, but that is an excellent point because usually you meet with anesthesiologist before your operation, and it may not be the same person that is going to do your anesthesia. But you - that is an excellent point. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, Dr. Ruggieri, thank you for taking time to be with us today. RUGGIERI : Oh, my pleasure.

The Huffington Post has a new section dedicated to science, also find a lot of technology there. Editors of the news site describe it as one-stop shopping for the latest in scientific news and opinion, with an aim to entertain as well as inform. Next up : The Huffington Post has a sizeable audience, and I mean over 1 billion page views per month. And the Huffington Post readers are the first to tell you that its appeal lies in its chatty and interactive style. So how does that style translate when you're covering science stories? How do you vet the science and blog posts written by unpaid contributors? Next up : Arianna Huffington is the president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post Media Group, also a nationally syndicated columnist, author of 13 books. I'm stumbling over myself because she needs no introduction. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Arianna. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Thank you so much. Thank you for having me on. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're welcome. Thanking you - thank you for taking time to be with us. Why is this the right time to launch Huff Post science? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Well, it's the right time because we seem to be, at the moment, confronting a kind of explosion of truly medieval thinking in our world, like questioning evolution, questioning global warming, questioning a lot of thought - a lot of things that we thought we could finally take for granted. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : And we feel that we have an opportunity to explore everything, from the big issues of our time, like the universe, to physical and chemical and other scientific discoveries, all the way down to the sense of wonder that the universe elicits, and to also end some false divisions, like we don't see that there is a division between spirituality and science. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : And in our first week, we actually had posts from different scientists who are very comfortable with religion, like Brown biology Professor Kenneth Miller, who has written that Darwin is not an obstacle to faith but is a key to understanding our relationship with God. And that has been a preoccupation of mine for many years. And so it's really a great opportunity now to reach a wider audience and have them also use the platform to explore all these questions. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Do you find it odd that science has become so politicized in our country? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : I do, actually, because I feel, in a way, that we in the media have partly some responsibility to play because we - instead of seeing our role as ferreting out the truth, we sometimes see our role as simply mediating a debate: on the one hand, Senator Inhofe, who thinks global warming is a hoax; on the other hand, someone discussing the dangers of global warming. And I think that has brought about a certain atmosphere where you can imagine everything being questioned. Maybe we'll have a debate as to whether the Earth is flat. And we do have a completely open debate about things while the jury is still out, but at the same time acknowledge that certain things have been settled by science. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Speaking of debate, I'm glad you brought it up because we are in the debate and campaigning season. Why isn't science ever mentioned in these debates, in these campaign issues? Why aren't we asking the candidates more questions about where they stand on issues like climate change and evolution? And I'm thinking, particularly back in December of 2007, at the Republican debate in Iowa where the candidates refused to show their hands if they believed climate change. Do you remember that? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : I know and evolution, I remember that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : That was an amazing moment when they obviously considered that being - that recognizing evolution as a fact would be detrimental to their electoral chances. But that's why I feel it's an important moment to say it's great to debate everything. But also, it's very central to our democracy to establish where the facts lie and to revere facts because as someone said, you know, everybody has a right to their opinion but not to their own set of facts. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Shouldn't we demand from our candidates that they have some, at least, grounding in basic science? And shouldn't we ask them - as much as you want to see their birth certificate, or you want to see their taxes from the, you know, 2011, shouldn't we be asking them how old do you think the Earth is, questions like that? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : That would be great, actually. I think we should ask our leaders and your listeners that question. What would you include in that questionnaire? What kind of questions would go along with how old do you think the Earth is? It would be a great questionnaire, you know, to send to campaigns. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : You know how campaigns have to answer all sorts of questionnaires, from Planned Parenthood to The Family Coalition. So how about also answering questions from a coalition of citizens who care about science? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. Well, when we get down if we get down to two candidates for the presidential election... ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Let's do it. Let's... \n\n ###",

ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : OK. I'll help you do it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : OK. We'll supply some questions. Talking with Arianna Huffington on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. Let's talk about your blog post for a second. There is a mechanism for editorial oversight, correct? ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Yes. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You have people, legitimate science writers on that staff. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Absolutely. And we also have, as you may have seen, a new feature that we call Talk Nerdy to Me. Cara Santa Maria, who is - has a PhD in science, and her job is to take different issues and to try to make them very understandable and also kind of introduce some humor to them because part of what we want to do is to expand the numbers of people who care about science and who want to learn about science and issues attached on our lives every day that have a scientific grounding. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. You call - you touched on it just briefly, that the intersection of science and religion is one of your passions. And you were saying, and we've had other scientists on SCIENCE FRIDAY, who say there really doesn't have to be the divide there. I can believe in my religion and still believe in science at the same time. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Exactly. And there is a book which actually I have in front of me - I'm sure you know it - by Arthur Koestler called \"The Act of Creation,\" which is a beautiful accounting of many scientists' own writings about their discoveries, and how they use dreams, intuition and a lot of non-factual and scientific avenues to get to their discoveries and then, of course, have to prove everything with all the means at their disposal. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : I remember also Einstein's breakthrough equation, you know, E=MC2. And for me, that equation is like - is an assurance that nothing in the universe is unrelated to anything else, and then it has - the way that it had an emotional impact on him, not just an intellectual impact. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Yeah. And there is the religious aspect, and then there's the political aspect, and then there is the - I'm not sure where this originated. I'm thinking of global warming or green technologies and why this kind of stuff has to be political. Why do issues about the environment become political? You know, the environment was - the EPA was created by Richard Nixon back in the early '70s. When did this all become... ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Yes. I mean, it's hard to imagine Richard Nixon winning the Republican nomination at the moment, because remember, he also wanted a lot of things done to the economy that many would disapprove of today in the Republican Party. But I think beyond that there's so many powerful economic interests here at work, whether it's the oil industry or the chemical industry. And that's why it's very important to make sure that facts prevail, and that we don't let, you know, special interests even determine what to consider scientific truth or not. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, I want to wish you good luck in - on your Huffington Post site and bringing science and technology to more people there. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Thank you so much. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You need to be congratulated. We'll see you - maybe we'll have some SCIENCE FRIDAY stuff up there that we can recommend questions to be asked of the candidates. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Oh, we - definitely, let's do that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Arianna, thank you for taking time to be with us today. ARIANNA HUFFINGTON : Thank you. Thank you so much.

So far, his approval has been in the low single digits with that voting demographic, and previous overtures to the community have been called tone deaf. NPR's Sam Sanders was in Detroit yesterday, and he reports on how Trump's latest effort was received. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : The service began a few minutes late. The pews are about half-full. All the press and the Secret Service seems to make people there nervous. But once it began, the Saturday service at Greater Faith Ministries Church in Detroit sounded just like you'd expect. UNIDENTIFIED MAN : How many know you're in the house of the Lord today? How many know he is a great God? SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : This service was different, though. There was a special guest at this almost all-black gathering. And even Pastor Wayne T. Jackson had to acknowledge that guest was kind of a little bit out of place. WAYNE T JACKSON : First of all, I understand that this is his first African-American church he's been in, y'all (laughter). SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : But Donald Trump made his best effort - standing and clapping during the songs, sometimes on beats one, two, three and four, smiling, shaking hands, even holding a baby perhaps a little too high over his head. This was Trump black outreach version 2.0. After rumors all week that he wouldn't even address the crowd there, Trump spoke. DONALD TRUMP : Thank you very much. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : Trump's message was very different than the question he had been asking black voters previously, which was - what do you have to lose? DONALD TRUMP : You do right every day by your community and your families. You raise children in the light of God. I will always support your church - always - and defend your right to worship. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : Trump said he came to listen. He called for a new civil rights agenda. He acknowledged that blacks still face discrimination in this country, and he listed some of the things he'd like to make happen for Detroit and the country. DONALD TRUMP : We're going to bring jobs back. I will have a chance - thank you. We'll bring them back. Taking them back from Mexico and everywhere else because they're gone. I will have a chance to discuss school choice, which is very important, and how to put every American on the ladder to success - a great education and a great job. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : Trump also closed his remarks with Scripture. DONALD TRUMP : See, most groups I speak to don't know that, but we know it. If you want, we can say it... SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : Before the service, Trump also gave a one-on-one interview with Pastor Jackson. There had been rumors the interview would be entirely scripted, questions and answers. Trump didn't stay for the entire church service. After the pastor gave him a prayer shawl from Israel, Trump was off to a suburb of Detroit called River Rouge. His guide was Dr. Ben Carson - Detroit native, former presidential candidate, current Trump surrogate. Carson was showing Trump around his old neighborhood. They even said hi to the current owner of Carson's childhood home. DONALD TRUMP : ...Very much, good luck. FELICIA REESE : Oh, OK, all right. Well, you have a nice time at... DONALD TRUMP : ...You, too. Watch that bee. FELICIA REESE : Thank you. SAM SANDERS, BYLINE : That's Felicia Reese. She's a nurse. But Trump and Carson weren't there long, maybe 10 minutes.

I'm Ira Flatow. We talk many times about the rise of drug-resistant bacteria, germs that resist most antibiotics, except for a precious few. A case in point is tuberculosis. But now comes word of a strain of TB that is totally drug-resistant, TDR TB as doctors are calling it. There are no second-choice antibiotics here. We simply have no drugs to fight this superbug. There are no weapons left. And it has now infected a dozen patients in India. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How did the strain originate? And if our drugs don't work anymore, what can doctors do, if anything, and what kind of threat does it - well, does it pose to us - the rest of the people around the world? Here to talk about it is Maryn McKenna. She is the author of \"Superbug: The Fatal Menace of MRSA.\" She also writes the \"Superbug\" blog for Wired, where the story appeared. She joins us by phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. MARYN MCKENNA : Thank you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Maryn, tell us about this - it sounds pretty scary this new superbug. MARYN MCKENNA : You know, I have to say I find this chilling, and it's a little complicated. So the way this came to light is that immediately before Christmas, so almost everyone missed it at the time, including me, a couple of physicians in Mumbai wrote a letter to a medical journal describing four patients they have with what they called totally drug-resistant TB. Which means, as you said, none of the first-line drugs and none of the second-line drugs - that's more than a dozen drugs, altogether - nothing worked. MARYN MCKENNA : These people had - just were uncurable. The Indian media jumped on the story and got the hospital to admit that there are actually were 12 patients. They just happened to have complete histories for four. Now, over the next couple days, it turns out that TDR TB was actually seen before - in 2009 in 15 patients in Iran. I've spoken to the Iranian physicians. No one is quite sure what happened to those folks. And there were also two cases in Italy who both died in 2003. MARYN MCKENNA : So clearly, it's been popping up for a while, but it looks like this Indian cluster is the one that may be the most - the best documented, and it's certainly the one causing the most concern. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Maryn, do we know how this originated, or how it started? MARYN MCKENNA : No. Unfortunately, that's the problem. So, you know, when we talk about antibiotic resistance, as you and I have talked before, we - there are all kinds of things that can contribute to that - misused of antibiotics; in agriculture, misused in, sort of, everyday medicine. What's going on here with this TB very clearly is that it's an artifact created by poor medical care and poor use of drugs. These people, in India at least, and certainly in the other cases, were not correctly diagnosed to start with. MARYN MCKENNA : They were given the wrong drugs. They weren't given the right length of drugs, and even at the best of times, MDR TB or highly resistant TB is difficult to treat. And they were sort of kind of natural laboratories for the emergence of the totally resistant strain. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So how fearful should we be, that this strain will permeate around the world? MARYN MCKENNA : So, you know, this is a sort of plus-minus proposition. Because, on the one hand, it's really troubling to have something like this because we live in such a globalized society where people move back and forth from the industrialized world to the developing world through different economies. And diagnostic tools for TB are really not good. So, you might think that someone has everyday TB, and they might have a resistant form. The other side of that is that TB is not that easy to catch. MARYN MCKENNA : It's not like measles. You don't catch TB by just walking past someone on the street. You have to be in close contact with them. But I'll say the third thing that really makes my jaw drop is that, literally, as I was waiting for this phone line to come live, a bulletin moved across the wire that there are two more cases of TDR TB in another hospital in a different part of India. They were being held in confinement in the hospital, and one of them has gone missing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : One of the patients has gone missing? MARYN MCKENNA : One of the patients has skipped out, probably understandably, because they - these drugs are not pleasant to take, and they cause a lot of side effects. You have to take them for a very long time. It's probably not very pleasant being treated as a public health criminal. So one of these patients has checked himself out of the hospital and disappeared. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So we don't know where that - an infectious patient with the strain of totally drug-resistant TB... MARYN MCKENNA : Correct. IRA FLATOW, HOST : ...is missing. Wow. What would we do in this country? What are they doing in India, to find that person or to stop it from spreading? MARYN MCKENNA : Well, I think the Indian government is really kind of struggling with this. And it must be said that the media in India have really jumped on this story and are really pushing it forward, which I think is just fantastic. Because, of course, and, you know, as has been seen in other countries with other profound infectious diseases, there's a lot of stigma associated with a situation like this where your country suddenly gets identified with the deadly disease. So the Indian media are pushing the government to try to articulate its plans. But the reality is, India is a pretty under-resourced society when it comes particularly to health care because of the size of its population and the differential between the rich and the poor. It does not have the diagnostic tools that are needed. It's actually quite difficult to diagnose resistant TB, as opposed to plain TB. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So what do you do to treat these people? Are you going to do - or is it back to the old sanitarium, pre-antibiotic days? You put people out, isolate them, quarantine them and hope they get better? \n\n ###",

Nearly 27 percent of the people there are 65 or older. NPR's Ina Jaffe covers aging, so, of course, she wanted to go there and check it out. She did, and she's now back sharing her reporting. This week on NPR, you'll hear her stories on how Japan is changing as its population grows older. Ina joins us now from our studios at NPR West. Hi, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Hi, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : First off, why is Japan the oldest nation in the world? INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Well, it's not really because people live longer, although they do have a life expectancy about five years more than in this country. But really it's because the population is shrinking. Women there just aren't having as many babies. So if nothing changes by the year 2060, people aged 65-plus will make up at least 40 percent of the population there. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Wow. So I imagine that could, in turn, have an impact on the economy. INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Yeah, that's a real concern there because you have both this big decline in working-age population and then a strain on the social security system. So one of the government's ideas for dealing with this is to get more older people into the workforce and keep them there longer. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : How do they do that? I mean, you can't force people to work longer - or can you? INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Well, actually the bigger problem in Japan is that you can force people to retire. They have mandatory retirement there. And the age has been 60, though they're gradually raising it to 65. And you can keep working past mandatory retirement age sometimes, but there's not a lot of incentive because once you hit 60, your salary usually drops to a fraction of what you made before. So, you know, Americans would be on the phone to their lawyers, right? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah. INA JAFFE, BYLINE : But this is an accepted practice in Japan, and it's one of the things that some people I talked to say will have to change. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Something else that goes along with an aging population, unfortunately, can be Alzheimer's, other forms of dementia. Is that a concern there? INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Oh, definitely. You know how one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's, for example, is wandering, right? So in Japan last year, more than 12,000 people with dementia were missing long enough to be reported to the police. And while most were found alive within a week, nearly 500 were found dead and 150 were never found. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Oh my. So what is Japan doing about this? I mean, can the government do anything about that? INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Well, I went to a city called Matsudo that's taken a sort of community approach. For a few years now, they've been giving dementia awareness training to pharmacists and postal clerks and just people who volunteer to take it. And part of the thinking is that if you can't keep people from wandering, maybe you have a whole community that can keep them safe when they do. And this approach is now part of Japan's nationwide plan to deal with dementia, and millions of people there have already taken this training. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So what's it like to just spend some time in that country? I mean, do you see evidence of that aging population? INA JAFFE, BYLINE : Oh, you do. In the cities, for example, (laughter) one of the places you see it is convenience stores. And one of the things they're doing to compete is finding ways to cater to their aging clientele. You'll find products there you'd never see in your local mini mart like prepackaged meals for people who have trouble chewing. But really the place that you see aging of Japan most clearly is in the rural areas. There's a term you hear in Japan, it's village on the edge, as in village on the edge of extinction. I went to one a few hundred miles south of Tokyo where the population has gone from around 300 people to just 30. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Wow. INA JAFFE, BYLINE : It's now known as Scarecrow Village because a woman who lives there has repopulated the place by making scarecrows and putting them at the bus stop and in the school and in all the places people used to be. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That is a haunting image. INA JAFFE, BYLINE : It is. It's amazing to be there. \n\n ###",

It's a stressful job, heightened by recent tension between law enforcement and the public. So who would do it? This past month, three new officers were sworn in at Annapolis Police Department in Maryland. We're going to meet one of them. WILLIAM NOEL : My name is William Noel, originally from Washington, D.C., and I'm a police officer with the City of Annapolis Police Department. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : When I first got to know Will, he was a personal trainer here in Washington, D.C., helping all sorts of people get and stay fit. One of his clients worked with the Secret Service, and he convinced Will to start a second career in law enforcement. Will and I have talked before about what's going on with race relations and policing in this country, so we decided to invite him in and have that conversation on the radio. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You happen to be African-American man who... WILLIAM NOEL : ...Every day. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Every day, walking through life. Did you feel a different kind of weight or responsibility in talking about how police are interacting with communities of color? WILLIAM NOEL : No. When I'm asked that, all I can do is to draw on my experiences. The early part of my childhood, I grew up in southeast Washington, D.C., and it was at a time right before, you know, crack took off and things like that. So the neighborhood was a little dicey, but being a child that young, I never knew any better. So I would think about when I saw the police come around. I never saw violence. I never saw people being mistreated. WILLIAM NOEL : I saw people interact with the police, and I saw the police say what they had to say and I saw the residents say what they had to say, but everybody left in one piece. Moving on to high school, yeah, I had friends that may have been in some things they shouldn't have been into, but I never saw police mistreat them. So to see where things are right now, it's unfortunate. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : As part of your training, did you do any simulations where you were forced to confront a really perhaps emotionally complicated moment where things could get really tense really fast and how to de-escalate that situation? WILLIAM NOEL : There are times where someone can be on a street and you're trying to talk to someone, but maybe they're impaired some kind of way and you can't bring them down there, and they react violently. There's no talking in a calm tone of voice at that point because they're not talking to you that way. But I would imagine everyone's first response is to, hey, let's try to figure this out, not to go in there and, you know, be G.I. Joe about it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In that context, do you think you bring something different to it because you are 38 years old and not 22? WILLIAM NOEL : Yeah, it's helped because I've dealt with a myriad of people, and I could even trace that back to when I was a trainer. You trained people from multiple economic backgrounds, levels of education, and you've got to be able to communicate effectively to all of them in a manner that conveys expert, I'm in control of the situation, and you can trust me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There was this report out from the Justice Department about the Baltimore Police Department, an investigation - pretty damning - found that that department discovered police that were disproportionately targeting African-Americans, using excessive force against some juveniles. How do those revelations inform how you look at your own job? I mean, you're a new cop in Annapolis, which is not that far away from Baltimore. WILLIAM NOEL : It informs me only in that you have to conduct yourself as if you're always being watched. I can only handle the things that I do. And I remind myself, even if I'm calling someone to ask them a follow-up question, conduct yourself like a professional. Ask your questions, answer their questions with respect. Baltimore just reminds you that someone's always watching you. And you want to finish each shift with no regrets on how you did your job. And one thing that I will say that I've learned throughout this process in training and since I've been working at the department is if there's something that you've done wrong or something that, you know, there might've been a mistake, own it. That's how I conduct myself. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you think that's part of why there is this so-called trust gap that even, you know, Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, has talked about? The fact that police departments and the communities they serve, that they're not getting each other, they don't trust each other? WILLIAM NOEL : I mean, there's accountability to be had on both sides, whether it be citizens towards us or us toward citizens. The sooner everyone has accountability for their own actions and it's visible to one another, then you'll start seeing that. I think that's why you see a big push with community policing. That model's a big deal. You don't want to only be seen when shots got fired. You want to be seen just being in the community, being a part of what people do every day, showing up just to be a ray of sunshine. Not to sound cheesy, but if you only show up when shots get fired but not on the other days just to, hey, I'm around, everything good here - I think if the public sees more of that and can understand that we really are there to help, that builds trust as well. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What do your friends and family think about this new move? WILLIAM NOEL : Oh, they think I'm crazy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : (Laughter). WILLIAM NOEL : The thing that seems to stick out in a lot of people's minds is my age. \n\n ###",

This week, being a graduate student. On Tuesday, in a case brought by Columbia University grad students, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that teaching assistants at private colleges have the right to form a union. The Columbia students were seeking to collectively bargain over things like compensation, health care and family benefits. Paul Katz, a third-year grad student in Latin American history, is one of the organizers of the Columbia effort. And he joins us from our New York bureau. Welcome to the program. PAUL KATZ : Oh, thank you so much for having me. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : Now, why do Columbia graduate students think it's necessary to organize? PAUL KATZ : Well, fundamentally, it's a question of having a voice in our graduate experiences and primarily in our working conditions. We spend five, six, seven years of our lives pursuing both our own research and teaching and research assistantship at the university. This really is, I think, an important contribution to the function of the university, and we believe we deserve a say in our working conditions. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : How precarious an economic situation is it being a grad student, especially in a place like New York City? PAUL KATZ : Well, really, the experience I can speak to most directly is my own. And that is, of course, living in one of the most expensive cities in the country. At a very basic level we have to spend, you know, an inordinate share of our income on rent. We basically just don't have a margin for error. You know, any kind of crisis or emergency is going to be very hard to address if you're living on, say, $28,000 a year. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : I understand you have a part-time job as a tour guide to help make ends meet? PAUL KATZ : Indeed, yes. I work for a great company called Big Onion Tours. In fact, I'm just coming right now from leading a tour of the Lower East Side. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : And so this is something you do in your spare time, right? PAUL KATZ : It is, yes. And while it is, you know, very much an enjoyable job and I appreciate it tremendously, I think the very existence of this company, which employs history graduate students from throughout New York City, is a testament to just how difficult it is to make ends meet as a grad student here. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : Now, you're 30 years old. Is that right? PAUL KATZ : Well, 29, about to turn 30. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : So this is very different, I assume, from being a struggling 20-year-old undergraduate. PAUL KATZ : Well, I mean, it feels like it ought to be, right? I mean, I suppose that's one of our frustrations is that I think when some people think about students in general they have in mind, you know, a college sophomore and a 19-year-old where, you know, certainly have a very high tolerance for making ends meet with, you know, very little in the way of resources. But, you know, many of us pursuing Ph.D.s are in our late 20s, in our early or mid-30s. And by this point, it would be nice to have a little bit more stability and security in our lives. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : So what is the first thing you want to try to do - to get for the graduate students at Columbia? PAUL KATZ : Well, our main interest, the thing that unites all of us across departments, is a desire to negotiate a binding contract with the administration. More specifically, though, you know, talking to people across campus, it's become clear that we do share certain common concerns. You know, front and center is health care. I think many of us are concerned about the limits of our student health care plan, which is basically identical to the one that undergraduates receive. PAUL KATZ : We're concerned about the expense of adding dependents to our health plan, our lack of dental and vision coverage. More broadly, we're concerned about a lack of a grievance process - protections against, say, sexual harassment and assault. As long as we don't have clear procedures in place to deal with issues as they arise, it's very hard to feel secure in our lives. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST : Paul Katz is a graduate student at Columbia University. Thank you very much for talking to us. PAUL KATZ : Oh, thank you so much for having me.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Two major faith groups gathered this weekend to discuss what could be sweeping reform. At the Vatican, Catholic leaders wrapped up a four-day summit on clerical sex abuse. And in St. Louis, leaders of the United Methodist Church, one of the country's largest Protestant denominations, held a conference on LGBTQ clergy and same-sex weddings. Together, they represent more than 1 billion worshippers around the world, and the outcomes could have significant implications for how congregants view church leadership. To walk us through what happened, we've invited Washington Post religion reporter Julie Zauzmer. She's with us now in our studios in Washington, D.C. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Welcome. Thank you for joining us. JULIE ZAUZMER : Thanks so much for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So let's start first with the Vatican summit on child sex abuse that started on Thursday. What's happened since then? JULIE ZAUZMER : It's been an intense few days - 190 Catholic leaders from the church around the world discussing the problem of sexual abuse and what to do about it. They're wrapping up without very many concrete suggestions but a lot of bishops promising to go back home and come up with solutions in their own countries. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Well, you know, well, Pope Francis called for a, quote, \"all-out battle on clerical sex abuse.\" So what did that actually mean? I take it he's getting very mixed reactions. JULIE ZAUZMER : Yes. He gave his address this morning, which would have been the time to declare specific policies that he's changing. And he did not do that. At the beginning of this summit, he distributed a list of 21 suggestions he has for concrete reforms or discussion points for how to get to those reforms. The bishops are going to take those home. But this did not result in a worldwide policy change. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you have any sense of why? I know that this is all very new, and these remarks were just delivered. But given how high the expectations were for this meeting, this seems like a very oddly ambiguous conclusion. Is there any sense of why? JULIE ZAUZMER : I think he knew all along that they weren't going to be able to reach something that - a solution that works for the entire world in a four-day meeting. He had said beforehand, lower your expectations. If you look at the United States, the United States is a very good example here of a region-specific goal where back in November, the U.S. bishops all got together, and they wanted to address the question of accountability of bishops. If a bishop does something wrong, what do you do about that? JULIE ZAUZMER : That's not the question in other parts of the world. In some parts of the world, the question is child marriage, for example. There are very different goals when it comes to sexual abuse in different countries. And the U.S. bishops are basically leaving at the same place where they came in. They're leaving with a statement today saying, OK. We had a good meeting. We're going to meet again in June, and we're going to deal with bishop accountability because that's what we wanted to do all along. I think a lot of the bishops are returning to their home countries to deal with their specific issues. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So now let's go to St. Louis, where leaders of the United Methodist Church are deciding whether to permit openly LGBTQ clergy and same-sex weddings. And obviously, this is a very complicated issue. There are lots of different proposals on the table. But briefly, could you tell us what's the status quo? Because I think people know that in some parts of the country, there are LGBTQ clergy. There are same-sex weddings performed. In other parts of the country, not. What's the discussion here - whether to create a national standard, an international standard? JULIE ZAUZMER : Exactly. If you read the United Methodist Church \"Book Of Discipline,\" the letter of the law right now says no gay clergy, no gay weddings. Of course, as you said, there are bishops across the United States who pretty openly ignore that, and there are plenty of gay clergy in the United Methodist Church who perform plenty of gay weddings. The question is - it's not sustainable. The question is, what are they going to do going forward? And the big question is, should they split the church? MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : What are the different options that they're considering? JULIE ZAUZMER : There are several options which they can modify as they go. One option is to keep their traditional straight couples only definition of marriage and indeed double down on that and punish congregations that don't obey it. A second option is to split the church into three separate denominations - one that affirms LGBT people, one that doesn't and one that lets each church decide for themselves. A third option is to let each church decide for itself worldwide. A fourth option that is somewhat on the table is to remove the language entirely about the morality of same-sex marriage, thereby sort of tacitly saying that we do approve of this and that this is a positive good for our church. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you have any sense of where this debate is going? And I apologize if I'm asking you to speculate. JULIE ZAUZMER : I think that there is tremendous desire to get through this meeting with an answer. They've been putting off this question for a long time. There are a lot of Methodist leaders who want to by Tuesday night have a real solution. What that solution's going to be - I think a very popular plan is the - called the one church plan, where they would remain united but would allow each individual local congregation to just choose for themselves whether to do gay weddings and whether to ordain gay clergy, so they stay a denomination without really reaching an answer on the morality of this. But there's obviously other plans that are drastically different. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So, finally, do you see any kind of overlap here in terms of how these religious groups' polities are dealing with these issues? JULIE ZAUZMER : I think this week is a very good reminder for me and probably for many others who follow the religion world fairly closely that these institutions still matter - that we talk a lot about people becoming less affiliated and finding their own spirituality. When you see these huge, very institutional, very rigid organized meetings of the leaders of the Catholic Church, of the Methodist Church, you remember that policy still shapes people's lives, that the policies that come out of these very organized, systematic meetings are going to determine how a victim of sexual abuse in a country where there's no process for reporting that abuse - how that victim can come forward. These policies are going to determine whether people can get married in the churches they love and grew up in. These institutions still shape our day-to-day existence.

At some point during their public lives, they were labeled as angry. It's a label that many black women have struggled with in their professional and personal lives. All this month, NPR is exploring the power of anger. Today, we have a story from NPR's Mayowa Aina about one author who thinks it's time for black women to embrace their rage. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : The angry black woman is pretty well known. She shows up everywhere from pop culture to politics. She has an attitude. She's mean, loud and aggressive. Some trace the stereotype back to the 1950s and a TV show called \"Amos 'N' Andy.\" MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : The show was the first TV program to feature an all-black cast, and one character in particular was known for her sharp tongue. TIM MOORE : (As Kingfish) I was a sick man. ERNESTINE WADE : (As Sapphire) Sick man nothing. You had no business stuffing yourself the way you did at mama's house last night. TIM MOORE : (As Kingfish) Now, wait a minute... MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : This is Sapphire, and she constantly nags at her husband throughout the series. BRITTNEY COOPER : She's always berating people, particularly men, and just is not in control of her anger. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : And that's Brittney Cooper. She's a professor and author of the book \"Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower.\" Cooper says that the stereotype known as the angry black woman used to be called the Sapphire, and it's a stereotype that black women still struggle with almost 70 years after Sapphire was introduced onscreen. Even someone like Michelle Obama has talked about trying to distance herself from the stereotype. Right before leaving the White House, she talked about it with Oprah. OPRAH WINFREY : When you were labeled that angry black woman, was that one of the things that knocked you back a bit? MICHELLE OBAMA : That was one of those things that you just sort of think, hey, you don't even know me. OPRAH WINFREY : Yeah. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : Whether or not they are actually angry, Cooper says that labeling black women that way has a particular effect. BRITTNEY COOPER : Whenever someone weaponizes anger against black women, it is designed to silence them. It is designed to discredit them and to say that they are overreacting, that they are being hypersensitive, that their reaction is outsized. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : And she says this happens because generally, anger is an emotion that people are really uncomfortable with. It's something that they want to control rather than address. BRITTNEY COOPER : Unless, of course, we're talking about white men being angry and then, you know, the whole sort of American political system is designed to respond to white male anger and white male discontent. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : Cooper has pointed to the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as an example. Senator Lindsey Graham was shouting during Justice Kavanaugh's testimony. LINDSEY GRAHAM : This is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE : It was a turning point during the hearings, and Justice Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed. Cooper says that black women have had to be more strategic when expressing their anger, but it doesn't mean that they shouldn't. As a lecturer at a university, this was at the front of her mind. BRITTNEY COOPER : It was just always that I thought that I should, like, be in better control because I wanted people to respect me, and I didn't want my anger to cause people to not be able to hear the things that I was trying to say. \n\n ###",

Hillary Clinton brought in about $90 million. The fundraising gap between the two campaigns is closer than it has been all year. To talk more about this, we're joined by Nick Confessore, political reporter at The New York Times. Welcome, Nick. AILSA CHANG, HOST : Hey, Ailsa, how are you? AILSA CHANG, HOST : Good. Thanks for joining us. NICK CONFESSORE : Of course. AILSA CHANG, HOST : So for months, we've been hearing that Trump has lagged in fundraising. What changed in July? NICK CONFESSORE : What changed is small donors and Trump actually trying to raise money for the first time in his entire campaign. He's mostly been self-funded, and what hasn't been self-funded until now has basically been the proceeds of buying all those hats and T-shirts you see with his slogan on them. AILSA CHANG, HOST : Right. NICK CONFESSORE : And that was basically his entire fundraising operation. And I think a lot of us thought that as soon as he tried to raise money from small donors he could be very successful about it, and, boy, we've been proven right. He has been extremely successful about it according to figures from his campaign. AILSA CHANG, HOST : And what does the average Trump donor look like? On average, what is the size of each donation so far? Do we know? NICK CONFESSORE : What they've said is that the average donation is around $50-$60, which is pretty low. And it suggests that they've managed to tap into the world of people who are not rich or even necessarily affluent but can afford to write a small check or put a recurring charge on their credit card. And, really, if you can tap those people, they're really important in politics, Ailsa, because a rich person who gives the maximum check of $2,700 for the campaign can't give any more after that. NICK CONFESSORE : A person or, more importantly, you know, a few hundred thousand people who will write that $25 check every month or put their credit card on file with the campaign, they're an incredibly important financial resources for a presidential candidate. AILSA CHANG, HOST : So has the Trump campaign given you any indication of how they're going to use this huge influx of cash now? NICK CONFESSORE : They haven't given one to me, and it really is the big question. It's pretty late in the campaign, Ailsa. Usually at this point in the modern era of campaigning, let's say, Romney or Obama or even Clinton in '08, if you can, you've already spent a few months or weeks making advance buys on television to lock on rates while they're low. You've hopefully had field staff out in the key swing states for months or more building relationships in their communities, getting ready to turn out the vote. It's not clear how much of that, if any, Trump has done. In fact, there are... AILSA CHANG, HOST : Right. NICK CONFESSORE : ...Signs that he's basically outsourced it to the Republican National Committee, which has had its own program in place for a while to get ready for the nominee. So the big question to come back to again is what do they do with that $74 million cash on hand that they say they have? Well, a big piece of it will probably flow to the party to run those grassroots efforts. And you have to imagine we will finally see some Donald Trump campaign ads in force on the airwaves. AILSA CHANG, HOST : And I guess the question is, is there enough time to drastically improve Trump's campaign infrastructure? Is there time? NICK CONFESSORE : It's not really enough time for Trump to do it. What his campaign will tell you - and what I think is partly true - is that they have the Republican National Committee. After Obama won in 2012, the Republicans, you know, looked ahead to the future and thought, well, Hillary Clinton as a likely candidate for 2016, and if she runs, she'll probably get the nomination. What can we do? Well, the RNC had a good fundraising base, and they had seen what happened when they were outmatched and when they chose a nominee kind of late in the game and got started late. NICK CONFESSORE : So around 2013, the RNC began doing some of this work on behalf of their future candidate. I think that in an ideal world, the nominee, Trump in this case, would be bringing more of his own lists and up-to-date data and technology and testing into the mix with the Republican National Committee.

It's a classic bromance. But what about when those friendships are put to a real test? NPR's Eliza Dennis tells us about a new Netflix film that considers that relationship. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : The movie is called \"Paddleton,\" which is also the name of a game the two main characters, Michael and Andy, have made up. They bounce a ball off a wall with rackets trying to get it into a trash can... MARK DUPLASS : (As Michael) Wait. No. No. I got it. I got it. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : ...A simple game in which writer-director Alex Lehmann sees a deeper meaning. ALEX LEHMANN : Every now and then and the ball is going to hit this weird angle on the medal and - bing - it's just going to go flying off in some random direction. And now you're running your butt off, you know, trying to catch up to the ball. You're out of breath. I mean, if that's not a metaphor for life, I don't know what is. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : The random direction in the lives of Michael and Andy comes when Michael, played by Mark Duplass, receives a diagnosis of stomach cancer. Instead of tubes and hospital stays, he decides he wants to take his own life. And he enlists his Paddleton partner Andy - Ray Romano - to help him get medication to do it. Alex Lehmann says his intent wasn't to be depressing. ALEX LEHMANN : It was really important for us to not just make people sit through 90 minutes of misery. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : There is a sweetness to this film. Actor and co-writer Mark Duplass agrees. MARK DUPLASS : I think the core of this movie for me was really all about showing a \"When Harry Met Sally\" between two platonic male friends. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : There's nothing extraordinary about these platonic lovers. MARK DUPLASS : They have dead-end jobs. Their apartments are crappy. They're not particularly witty or eloquent or attractive. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : It's the mundane that binds them together, like making pizza, watching Kung Fu movies and, of course, playing Paddleton along with other long-running games like the hangman word game on a green sweatshirt that Andy made for Michael, a puzzle he continuously tries and fails to solve. MARK DUPLASS : (As Michael) I think it's fatty pork. RAY ROMANO : (As Andy) It's not fatty pork. I made the shirt. MARK DUPLASS : (As Michael) You made it about three years ago. You still remember what it is? RAY ROMANO : (As Andy) It was a year and a half ago. And if it was fatty pork, there'd be two Ts. There'd be another T right there. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : Working on that puzzle is one of the friends' routines, one that they lean on as they process Michael's grim prognosis. Again, here's Alex Lehmann. ALEX LEHMANN : We didn't want to make a bucket list movie where all of a sudden they needed to do all these things to give their life meaning. ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE : Unlike other buddy and bromance films, we don't see Michael and Andy becoming friends, but like those films, they do go on an adventure. In this case, it's a six-hour road trip to pick up lethal medication that will end Michael's life. And here's where the only tension of the whole film unfolds. Andy, who has seemed so supportive of his friend's decision, ends up buying a toy combination safe and locks the pills away. But he quickly gets up the code. RAY ROMANO : (As Andy) One, two, three, four. \n\n ###",

One woman from Alabama wants to return from Syria. The State Department says she's not a citizen so won't be let in. To talk about the broader picture, Bennett Clifford is here in the studio. He's with the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Thanks for coming in. BENNETT CLIFFORD : Thank you very much for having me. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : How many Americans are believed to have gone to Syria to join ISIS, either as fighters or supporters? BENNETT CLIFFORD : Well, FBI Director Wray testified before Congress that 295 Americans either traveled or attempted to travel to Syria to join militant groups. If you'll notice, that figure includes people who were stopped at the airport as well as people who joined groups other than the Islamic State. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : So close to 300 Americans. How does that compare to people in, say, Western Europe? BENNETT CLIFFORD : It pales in comparison to a lot of Western European countries. Two numbers stand out. In France, over 1,900 people traveled - successfully traveled to join the Islamic State. Even in a smaller country like Belgium, they report numbers of over 500 of their citizens who traveled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And this person who's in the headlines - and they're from Alabama - is a woman. I imagine the majority of people who go over are men. What are the numbers there? BENNETT CLIFFORD : In the American context, the study that we conducted last year found that about 13 percent of American ISIS recruits were women. We think that's an underestimation. Their stories are not necessarily reported in Islamic State propaganda due to the lesser status of women within that organization. It makes it easier for them to slip through the cracks. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Yeah. And as we have seen ISIS lose these big cities - Mosul, Raqqa - and its footprint shrink, how many Americans have tried to come back? BENNETT CLIFFORD : We know of 16 Americans who have returned to the United States after fighting for Syrian and Iraqi jihadis groups. The majority of them came back in handcuffs. They were either arrested by Syrian or Iraqi forces overseas or arrested after they came back into the United States. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : The majority came back in handcuffs, but I understand you met with one who was released back into society. Tell us about him. BENNETT CLIFFORD : So this individual, who we refer to in our study as Moe (ph), is currently participating in an innovative program in New York that focuses on deradicalizing other people that may be heading down a similar path as him. Authorities in New York decided to give him leniency for the material support statute violation that he was facing in return for his participation and cooperation. Besides his participation in this program, we know as well that he's been cooperative in providing information related to the Islamic State, as well as potentially other Americans that fought for the group. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : That seems to be a difficult judgment call whether you send somebody to prison or into a program that might allow them to help deradicalize others. BENNETT CLIFFORD : Yes, and it needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis. Part of the difficulty, I would say, in looking at these cases is it's very hard to determine whether an individual is disillusioned with jihadism, that they've rejected the ideology or whether they've rejected their group or whether they're simply putting on a face to avoid criminal punishment. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Yeah. This woman from Alabama, Hoda Muthana, says that she is disillusioned with jihadism. She says she didn't fight for ISIS but was married to fighters. Has the U.S. typically treated these so-called ISIS wives differently from the fighters themselves? BENNETT CLIFFORD : One of the difficulties there is that women, in some cases, are able to draw on this narrative that since they were not fighting members of the group and relegated to either logistics or house management or other activities on behalf of the Islamic State - that they're less culpable for their actions. I don't think that's the case. I think that women participated in the Islamic State, particularly foreign women, in different ways than men did, but ones that don't make them any less complicit or culpable in what the Islamic State did. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And just in our last 30 seconds or so, how does the U.S. approach to these issues compare with other Western democracies? BENNETT CLIFFORD : We have the benefit of the material support statute which allows travel to join a foreign terrorist organization itself to be criminalized and punished by prison sentences of 15 to 20 years. Very few other Western countries have statutes like that. And if they do, they carry lesser prison sentences. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Bennett Clifford, thank you so much.

First there was going to be a new category - Best Popular Film. Then there wasn't. There was a host, Kevin Hart, whose long-ago homophobic tweets generated a controversy, so he stepped down. Specific awards and performances were going to be cut from broadcast until they weren't. So what exactly can viewers expect from Sunday's ceremony? Well, here to discuss is NPR movie critic Bob Mondello chuckling at his own introduction. Welcome to the studio, Bob. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : (Laughter) It's good to be here. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So is there some reason this year's planning has been such a mess? BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Yeah, there is. The Motion Picture Academy's under a lot of pressure - financial pressure - because last year's ceremony was the least-viewed Oscars in history. And low ratings mean low ad revenue for the next year. And the Oscars make most of their money for the year from the Oscar ceremony. The proposed changes were all designed to make things tighter, shorter and to encourage more people to watch. And the point, remember, is to promote movies, to make the industry look good. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So let's talk about the show part of that. The Academy has decided to go without a host. How exactly is this going to work? BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Well, we hope it doesn't work the way it did last time that they didn't have a host, which was about 30 years ago. Do you remember Rob Lowe singing to Snow White? EILEEN BOWMAN : (Singing, as Snow White) Starring in cartoons every night and day. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So many questions here. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : (Laughter). ROB LOWE : (Singing) But you said goodbye to Grumpy and Sleepy, left the dwarves behind... BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : This was 1989, and... AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : That's no excuse, but yeah, go on. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Exactly. That's what happened the last time that they didn't have a host. He was just one of many celebrities that they brought up on stage. And he was theoretically entertaining the audience at that point. The problem is that host monologues take at least 10 minutes usually, right? And they - this way they don't have to give them that. They don't have to give them something to do every 20 minutes thereafter. And it's easy enough to have the celebs just come out and announce things. The problem is that hosts have big followings, right? And originally they were thinking they would have The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, to do this. He's the highest-paid, most popular actor in movies right now. But he's making movies, and he didn't have time for all the prep. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : I want to talk about another issue - diversity. This is often talked about the Oscars in terms of the nominations, things like that. Now, maybe because \"Roma\" and \"Black Panther\" are in the mix, we're not hearing about it as much this year. Does that mean that the numbers have improved? BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Well, some of them have. It's not 20 white actors this year, so that's better. Spike Lee is in the mix for best director, as is Alfonso Cuaron, who's Hispanic. There's a foreign film director, Pavel Pavlovsky, the Polish director of \"Cold War.\" That category, though, is problematic I think because this has been a great year for women directors. The most powerful film I saw in 2018 was directed by a woman, \"Capernaum,\" directed by Nadine Labaki. And I - you know, they're not mentioned in there at all. There are no women directors in that category. In theory, there should be lots. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Well, let's talk about some of the others then. What have been some of the best women-directed movies this year? BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Well, \"Leave No Trace\" is extraordinary. It was directed by Debra Granik. It's a hundred percent on Rotten Tomatoes. It's just an amazing picture. I really liked \"The Rider\" by Chloe Zhao. Both of those were in my 10 best list - \"Destroyer\" by Karyn Kusama. And there's a movie that got - it got a bunch of other nominations, which is \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" It got a Oscar nomination for Best Actress for Melissa McCarthy, Best Supporting Actor for Richard E. Grant. Nicole Holofcener got a screenplay nomination. But they didn't nominate the director who pulls all that together. I mean, let's listen to a clip. You'll hear why this film is nominated. MELISSA MCCARTHY : (As Lee Israel) You're friends with Julia (ph) something. RICHARD E GRANT : (As Jack Hock) Steinberg (ph). MELISSA MCCARTHY : (As Lee Israel) Yeah. \n\n ###",

Now, that's where we invite interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. We want to continue the conversation that we and many others have been having about what happens or what should happen after allegations of sexual misconduct - especially allegations that don't fall neatly into the purview of law enforcement or an HR department. And a specific prompt for this conversation is the Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who was accused earlier this month by two different women of assaulting them on two different occasions, albeit many years ago. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Now, Fairfax is a Democrat, and Republicans have invited his two accusers to testify after calling for his resignation. Statehouse Democrats object, saying this is a political show. Fairfax says that law enforcement or neutral investigations should be involved. And some are asking if there is another way. Now, a group of 100 African-American women published an open letter last week that reads in part, \"we strongly believe that every woman who is brave enough to come forward with allegation of sexual assault should be heard, respected and have their allegations taken seriously\" - unquote. But it also goes on to say, we are uniquely familiar with the far-reaching dangers of rushing to judgment that we cannot merely stand by now and allow allegations that have not been investigated be used to justify the destruction of a person's professional career and personal reputation. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So two of the women who signed that letter are with me now. Julianne Malveaux is an economist and president emerita of Bennett College, which is one of the two historically black colleges for women in the U.S. She's here with me in our studios in Washington, D.C. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thank you for coming. JULIANNE MALVEAUX : Good to be with you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Melanie Campbell is the president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. And she's with us from New Orleans. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Melanie Campbell, thank you so much as well. MELANIE CAMPBELL : Thank you. Good to be here. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you're... MELANIE CAMPBELL : (Unintelligible). JULIANNE MALVEAUX : OK, Melanie. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So you're both obviously uncomfortable with how this is unfolding. So Julianne, as briefly as you can, tell me, what is it specifically that bothers you about the way these stories are - particularly this one - is unfolding? JULIANNE MALVEAUX : The timing, I think, is the most unfortunate thing. You do want to believe the women, of course, but you can't believe all the women. I'm not casting any shade on these women, but I'd like to see an investigation - not a Republican-orchestrated circus, but an investigation. You can - Bob Johnson actually offered $150,000, and he said the parties can choose a law firm or investigators of their own choice. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Bob Johnson, the co-founder of BET. JULIANNE MALVEAUX : A hundred fifty grand. Dr. Tyson has said no, she doesn't want to do that. She wants to talk to the legislature. The other woman, Ms. Weaver (ph), has said pretty much the same thing. Well, come on. If - an investigation is the only way to be fair to everyone. A legal investigation is the only way to be fair - just to set up and to air allegations. JULIANNE MALVEAUX : We saw how that worked out with Christine Blasey Ford. She basically was treated poorly, I think, by the Republicans. But, you know, Kavanaugh's people probably say he was treated poorly as well. But she just had a he said, she said kind of thing. We need to have an investigation. There've been allegations about emails that had been passed back and forth. You can check that out. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Melanie Campbell, there are those who would argue that the - part of the reason that you're taking this stance is that Justin Fairfax is a Democrat and a progressive and that perhaps there wouldn't be the same approach if this - if he were - had a different political persuasion. And what do you say to that? MELANIE CAMPBELL : Well, I say they don't know what they're talking about because they don't know me. But I live in Virginia. I vote in Virginia, right? My party affiliation has nothing to do with it. People know (unintelligible) the Democratic Party all the time. So it's not about the party. It's about being able to say that we cannot have justice by tweet or justice... JULIANNE MALVEAUX : Hello. MELANIE CAMPBELL : ...Enough Facebook postings and what people are saying online as that's part of justice. As black people in this country, you know, I don't judge Justin Fairfax, Ms. Tyson or Ms. Watson. They all have a right to due process. You cannot ignore, though - I totally agree with Julianne - how this even started is very political, right? And so the history for black people, whether as a black woman who's not believed, right, and a black man who, if you looked the wrong way, you know, look at it. And, of course, those were racial. But it's still about justice and going through a process. \n\n ###",

I've been sexually assaulted in my life. And so it's not something I talk about a lot, but I'm saying - and - I'm not - and every woman who's gone through something has a right to be heard. And also, if I say you did it, then I know I have - there has to be some judicial system, as flawed as it is, that goes through the process legally to deal with that charge. Otherwise, if you - if people, like, jumping up and saying, OK. You know, it's got to be true. No, it has to be investigated. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So in the time... MELANIE CAMPBELL : And it does not need to be investigated, you know, in a partisan manner. It does need to be investigated in a way that law enforcement can check these things out... MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So... MELANIE CAMPBELL : ...And check these stories out. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So we've got about three minutes left. I wanted to hear from each of you for that. And you both raise a number of important issues. You've both talked about the fact that - and frankly, one of the reasons we called both of you is that this is personal for both of you. I mean, Julianne Malveaux, you've been the president of a women's college. You've surely counseled many women... JULIANNE MALVEAUX : Yes. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...Who've had this experience. And Melanie Campbell, as you've just told us, you've experienced this, unfortunately, yourself. And then there's this very ugly history of black women being assaulted without consequence and of black men being falsely accused. So in the time that we have left - and unfortunately, it's not enough time for this next topic - Julianne, I'll start with you. What should fairness look like? JULIANNE MALVEAUX : Fairness should look like an investigation. The statute of limitations for rape is still not over in Massachusetts. Dr. Tyson can still bring rape charges. Duke University is looking into the allegations that Ms. Meredith - I got her last name wrong last time - Watson, the allegations that she's raised. She's apparently raised allegations also against a basketball player who was a Duke student as well. Duke cannot afford to have egg on their face on this, so they're going to be investigating as well. If there is a paper trail, we have the technology to go back and see, were there emails exchanged? What happened? And so I think that the investigation is the only way to go forward. JULIANNE MALVEAUX : Now, this situation, Michel, breaks my heart. I had the opportunity to meet Justin Fairfax actually on the street at UDC a few months ago, had a very convivial conversation with him. You know, and I'm an elder, and he gave me all those elder props, and I love that when younger people do that. But I had a good good feeling about him. So this just breaks my heart. It breaks my heart to think about black women feeling that they're not being believed. But we have to look into it. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : And, Melanie Campbell, what do you think fairness looks like? MELANIE CAMPBELL : Fairness - the same thing. He's just the investigation. Do it in a way that it's not a kangaroo court. Do it in a way that allows for - that's why we said it - stated this letter the way we did. We - consternation in even doing it but felt, knowing that the way some of this stuff is going in this new time we're in, to try to voice, to say, we have to use due process because otherwise, we're going to have a situation where people will lose their livelihoods, whether it be the woman who's making a charge or the man's being charged or whatever it is. It's like it's just - we cannot have some of the ways that things are being done where people - and then I heard someone earlier on your show, Lisa Borders, you know, who had stepped down, you know, from Time's Up, and I guess it was, you know, her choice. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sure. MELANIE CAMPBELL : And just being able to see all these things happening. And hopefully, she'd stepped down because she wanted to step down as opposed to her then having to step down... MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK. MELANIE CAMPBELL : ...Because of something someone may or may not have done. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : We have to leave it there for now. That's Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, Julianne Malveaux, president emerita of Bennett College.

We're going to turn now to Dr. Paul Spiegel. He is a physician. He is the director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He's worked for numerous humanitarian organizations over his career. Most notably, he spent more than 14 years working in the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UNHCR. He's given a lot of thought over his career to the ways in which humanitarian aid can become politicized and, in some cases, weaponized to send a message to those in power and to influence civilians. Dr. Spiegel was nice enough to come down from Baltimore to join us here in our studios in Washington, D.C. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Welcome. Thank you for joining us. PAUL SPIEGEL : Thank you, Michel. It's a pleasure to be here. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : As we just heard, food and medical aid at the border has become a symbol of the struggle between the Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, and the opposition leader, Juan Guaido. So there's no question that Venezuelans need that aid. But trying to set that aside for a moment, as hard as that is to do, is the U.S. making a political statement by parking the aid on the Colombian border? PAUL SPIEGEL : Yes, certainly. I mean, firstly, I wanted just to say that condolences to people who's been killed and injured in Venezuela. But the U.S. has - clearly linking their aid to a goal, which is to - a regime change. And in the humanitarian world, there are humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality and independence. And clearly - and impartiality. And clearly, the neutrality and independence of this aid is not there. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : But the argument is that humanitarian aid groups are trying to solve a problem that could have been solved long before by the Maduro government that the Maduro government is - I mean, the argument basically is the Maduro government is the entity that politicized this aid by depriving its own citizens of supplies that they desperately need. And what would you say to that? PAUL SPIEGEL : That there's no question that when there is a big humanitarian crisis and that Maduro and the government and their policies have for the most part caused this problem. But for - to provide humanitarian aid, it should be done in a neutral and independent way. And when the U.S. is linking or other governments are linking aid - and it's not just here in Venezuela - in Syria and Yemen. PAUL SPIEGEL : And when this occurs, it has numerous short and long-term effects. One of them is, of course, the humanitarian workers themselves become instrumentalized and part of the - say, in this case, those that are working with the U.S. government to be taking a side. And it's very important, even though we all have our own political views, for humanitarians to be seen as neutral and independent. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : There are obviously situations that are all, you know, different sort of all across the world. You know, but I think many people looking at it from this end think, how could it be otherwise? I mean, given that people need the aid, it's a very polarized, a very dangerous, very volatile situation. In order to get in there, these groups need to be aligned with somebody. PAUL SPIEGEL : Yeah. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : And what would you say to that? PAUL SPIEGEL : That - I would say two things. Number one is that aid - there is a need for aid both within the country and also to the 3 million Venezuelans who are outside of the country. And I think it's wonderful that the U.S. and other countries are actually providing this aid. But trying to, again, depoliticize to not make it as part of a regime change is hugely important. We're already seeing now, according to Maduro, that now Russia is giving - I think it is something like 30 tons or 300 tons of aid coming in. So it's becoming not just a national emergency, not just a regional emergency but, like we've seen in Syria and Yemen, a global emergency. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So let's take a step back and talk about sort of the system more broadly. You wrote a paper for Lancet - The Lancet, a medical journal, after you left the U.N. And you called out the humanitarian system as not just broke but broken. And I'd like to ask, you know, what makes you say that this is a problem with the whole system and not just the side effect of some very complex humanitarian crises that have come up over the past decade? PAUL SPIEGEL : Yeah. The humanitarian system was developed post-World War II, and it has a very Western, let's say, outlook towards it in terms of giving aid and then dependency. I must say, things are already changing since I've written that article in terms of looking at how humanitarians can get involved with development people and keep it sustainable. But there are a lot of issues still where much of the international aid is through the United Nations and through international organizations. It's not sufficiently going through national organizations. So it's a system that does create - that has problems with sustainability and creates dependence. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So could you just give us some sense - we have a couple of minutes left. Do you - you have time to tell us a bit more about this. What do you envision? Like, what would be, you know, better? I mean, by definition, the people are in these crises in part because they're in civil conflict, and so sort of asking everybody to just, you know, step aside and allow these neutral groups - you know, to keep it neutral, to offer aid too whoever needs it seems optimistic in many of these circumstances. So tell me what this would look like. And maybe you could spend a minute telling me what, if anything, humanitarian groups are doing now to restrategize given the circumstances that we all see? PAUL SPIEGEL : Yeah. Well, there are a lot of different things that are already happening, and many of them are positive. Number one is to reaffirm the Geneva Conventions, which means that warring factions are responsible for taking care of civilians on the borders - on the conflict and on the frontlines. PAUL SPIEGEL : And we've seen some cases where this is not occurring, such as in Mosul. And we're calling for a Mosul in Iraq, and we're calling for governments and particularly, let's say, the U.S. and the U.K. and others that are supporting other militaries to actually reinforce the Geneva Conventions and make sure that those people - the militaries are trained to take care of civilians that are wounded on the frontline. PAUL SPIEGEL : Secondly, more and more now, we're moving towards cash-based interventions. So in the past, we were giving aid. We were giving tents, we were giving food, as you're seeing here. When feasible, we're giving cash to the recipients. That, number one, removes the need for having many, many aid organizations. It also helps the local economy because you're actually spending locally as opposed to bringing in from - ships from U.S. and other places. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So we only have about 30 - we only have 20 seconds. Is there any place in the world where this is working as you would hope that it would right now? PAUL SPIEGEL : I'm pessimistic currently, and the reason is also because we're seeing the world changing right now globally. We're seeing an increase in populism. We're seeing the U.S. looking inwardly. And therefore, we're seeing discordance in the Security Council. And therefore, where - if the global powers were able to get together and agree on neutrality and independence, we would have a much stronger way forward. \n\n ###",

The blackout after the storm caused a lot of the island's health system to collapse. For months, the Puerto Rican government insisted that fewer than a hundred people died from the disaster. Now the official estimate is nearly 3,000. Tom Dreisbach from the NPR podcast Embedded has the story of how one family navigated through the chaos. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Zaida Maldonado has lived most of her life in the mountains in the middle of Puerto Rico along with her husband, Luis, and her two kids and their dogs. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : One of her kids, Javier, was born in 1999, and he was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : When he was a toddler, a doctor only gave Javier a couple years to live. But Zaida told me through an interpreter that the doctor was wrong. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER : So she feels it's a sign from God that he wants to stay on this earth with her. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Still, Javier could not talk or walk. The only way he was able to breathe was with a ventilator which pumped air into his lungs through a tube in his throat, and that ventilator ran on electricity. Then comes September 2017. UNIDENTIFIED NEWS ANCHOR : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Two days before hurricane Maria is set to make landfall, Zaida says she gets a call from Puerto Rico's Health Department. The health official says that they should go to the local emergency room before the storm. They say if the power goes out, the ER has backup supplies plus its own generator. So Zaida, her husband and her two kids go to the ER, and the hurricane makes landfall. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : By midday, the entire island has lost power. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : All communication goes down - no landlines, no cellphones. Inside the ER, Zaida and her family are actually feeling OK. The generator kicks on, and there's electricity to power Javier's ventilator. But over the next few days, things start to change. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Zaida says food, water and medical supplies are starting to run low, and even though the roads are flooded, Luis, Zaida's husband, takes the risk of driving home to get more supplies. Then a few hours later, a nurse comes to Zaida and says there's a problem. The ER has to shut down the generator. If they just leave it on, it will overheat and blow out. They can't take care of Javier anymore. And the family has to leave within about two hours. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Zaida says, we have to wait for my husband, but the nurse says there's no time. Zaida has a car there, but she's terrified of driving through the flooded roads.

ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : The paramedic says that transferring patients from hospital to hospital is not an emergency. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER : She doesn't know how in such a moment you could be so inhumane. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : In the end, despite the danger, Zaida decides to drive herself and her two kids to the second hospital. They load up into Zaida's car where there's a special plug that connects Javier's ventilator to the engine. The hospital in the town of Aibonito is much larger, so Zaida expects it will be more prepared. After all, this is where they were told to go. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Describe just what it looks like at the hospital in Aibonito. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : \"Total chaos.\" ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Zaida says there were people screaming, people asking desperately for dialysis or insulin for their diabetes or the chemotherapy drugs to treat their cancer. But this hospital does have the one thing Zaida desperately needs right now - electricity. And at this point, that actually makes it an outlier. Almost a week after the hurricane made landfall, FEMA said only 11 out of 69 hospitals either had electricity or fuel for generators. That means the vast majority had no power for basics like X-rays, IVs, sterilized operating rooms or ventilators. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Meanwhile, Luis, Zaida's husband, is searching for his family, and he finds them at the hospital. But the relief of finding each other doesn't last long. Javier has a weak immune system, and the hospital is a breeding ground for the sort of bacteria that could kill him. So after about five days in this hospital, Zaida and Luis decide the safest thing... ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : ...Is to just go home. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : They do not have electricity there, but they do have a generator. So now the goal of every day is to find enough diesel to keep it running. They scrape by on donations. They get some money from FEMA, but Luis says it's not enough. And from September 2017 until the next February, they do not have power. One night, Luis is checking on the ventilator, and Javier starts having convulsions. Then he stops breathing. Luis starts CPR. Several minutes go by. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Did you think he could pass away in that moment? ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER : Yeah.

TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Finally Javier's lungs and heart start working again. He's alive. But Luis is just fed up. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : So he goes to a radio station to try to talk about Javier's story. They actually put him on. UNIDENTIFIED RADIO HOST : (Speaking Spanish). ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : The host says, so you've been without running water or electricity for more than 130 days. And Luis says, yeah. Then the host asks how Javier is doing. UNIDENTIFIED RADIO HOST : (Speaking Spanish). ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Luis says, \"Javier is stable. Thank God he's stable.\" But they need help, and his visit to the radio station actually works. It takes about a month, but a volunteer crew from a power company in Illinois helps fix the grid in their neighborhood. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : There's this video of the moment when Zaida and Luis finally flip the circuit breaker on at the house. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : As the lights come on, Zaida covers her face with her hands and starts to cry. They have power, and Javier is alive. But of course they know how close they came. Thousands of people did not survive the storm and its aftermath. OMAYA SOSA PASCUAL : Most people that died did not die those first 72 hours. They died weeks and months after. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : Omaya Sosa Pascual runs Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism, and she says of course a massive hurricane is always going to be bad. But she says many deaths were a result of the failures by both the Puerto Rican and federal governments, from the lack of disaster planning to the inaccurate death toll that minimized the scale of the disaster to the disorganized effort to restore power. OMAYA SOSA PASCUAL : That's not part of the nature. That's part of the human incompetence. TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : President Trump has rejected any criticism and says the federal government's response was a quote, \"10 out of 10.\" Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo Rossello, did not respond to our requests for comment. But in the past, he has said he takes responsibility for his government's failures. But the key to preventing another disaster like Hurricane Maria is a working, resilient power grid. And Puerto Rico still does not have that. When I was talking to Zaida Maldonado, all of a sudden she had to interrupt the interview. ZAIDA MALDONADO : (Speaking Spanish). TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE : The power actually went out. She had a check on Javier and make sure the generator was working. She says this still happens a lot.

Critic Bob Mondello says \"How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\" is everything its predecessors were and more. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : We begin unusually for an animated film in darkness, a figure emerging from the fog, his sword bursting into flames, sort of the Viking equivalent of a light saber. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Oh, you're a demon. JAY BARUCHEL : (As Hiccup) No, I'm not a demon. I'm not a demon. See; just a guy - just a guy here to rescue these dragons, so... JAY BARUCHEL : UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) But you walked through fire. JAY BARUCHEL : (As Hiccup) Dragon scales - dragons shed a lot. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : This is Hiccup, who we left as a teenager and who's now a more or less mature young leader of a town that in the first two movies turned itself into... JAY BARUCHEL : (As Hiccup) The world's first dragon-Viking utopia. JAY BARUCHEL : UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Your utopia maybe. Mine's less crowded and more sanitary. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : Truth be told, this utopia was not built to last. Even if dragons weren't forever knocking it over, outside threats have been looming. What did seem built to last was the relationship between Hiccup and his dragon pal Toothless... JAY BARUCHEL : (As Hiccup) Hey, bud, wait up. BOB MONDELLO, BYLINE : ...Who's like a fire-breathing puppy - huge, playful and loyal. Though a discovery in a clearing in the woods... JAY BARUCHEL : (As Hiccup) He's not the only one.

One of the big questions was about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and when it might wrap up. NPR national political reporter Mara Liasson joins us with more from the White House. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Hi, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : There's a report from CNN today and a similar one from NBC yesterday suggesting that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, could turn over his findings to the Justice Department as early as next week. The president was asked about that today. What did he say? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Well, before we get to the president, we should say that there have been a lot of predictions over the last two years about when Mueller's investigation might end. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Right. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : NPR has not confirmed this reporting. But the president was asked about it, and here's what he said. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : That'll be totally up to the new attorney general. He's a tremendous man, a tremendous person who really respects this country and respects the Justice Department. So that'll be totally up to him. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : And the reason why it's totally up to him is because Robert Mueller is not required by law to turn over a report to Congress or the public. He is supposed to give the attorney general a confidential report when he completes his work. But nothing compels the attorney general to release it to anyone, including Congress. Now, he is also not running a kind of 9/11 commission. In other words, his job isn't to unravel every mystery and answer every question about what happened. He does have to uncover whether or not crimes were committed. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : So if the president says this is totally up to the attorney general, what has Barr said about whether this is going to be made public or given to Congress? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : At his confirmation hearings, Barr said that he would release as much of the report as was possible according to law and Justice Department policies. Democrats are a little nervous about this. They wanted to hear a more blanket guarantee that he would release the report. But if there is a report from Bob Mueller, there will be tremendous pressure to release it. Polls show that overwhelming majorities of Americans - like, 83 percent - say if there is a Mueller report, it should be released in its entirety. And even prominent Republicans in Congress like Chuck Grassley and John Cornyn in the Senate have both said if there's a Mueller report, it will have to be made public. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Well, over the last couple years, we have heard next to nothing from Mueller himself. Has that changed this week? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : No... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : (Laughter) OK. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : ...Still radio silence. One thing that's given him so much credibility is that he's not a participant in the partisan Twitter food fights around this investigation. He's said very few things. One time the special counsel's office did say something was to knock down that BuzzFeed report that said the president directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : His silence has only increased his credibility because the one time he did speak, he was, basically, shutting down a report or disputing a report that would have been negative to the president. On the other hand, the fact that he hasn't said anything has increased the desire and expectations for a complete, total accounting of what happened, especially from Democrats... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Yeah. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : ...And even some Republicans who think Mueller might be ready to exonerate the president. They'd like a full accounting, too. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Just in our last few seconds, how worried are they at the White House? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Trump has always seen this as a political not a legal problem. He's not worried about being indicted. He thinks the Justice Department rules against indicting a sitting president will hold. What he's really worried about is impeachment. He wants to undermine the credibility of Mueller so he can dismiss anything Mueller comes up with as a partisan smear. \n\n ###",

Every day for a year, he would write an essay about something delightful. He wrote about nicknames, fireflies, reckless air quotes. And about a hundred of those essays are now collected in his new book appropriately enough titled \"The Book Of Delights.\" When he came into our studios, Ross Gay told me that finding those delights turned out to be easier than he expected. ROSS GAY : Well, one of the things that I realized is that in the beginning I thought - oh, man. I'm going to, like, have to look around - like, be like really attentive. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Just scrounge for delights. ROSS GAY : Yeah - scrounge for delights, yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : (Laughter). ROSS GAY : And then, like, couple of weeks in - maybe a month or so in, I started to be, like, taking notebooks of like - that was delightful. That was delightful. That was delightful. That was - so like, accumulating all of these, you know? I have an essay called \"Stacks Of Delights\" (ph) or something like... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Right, where you're like... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : ...Clear the decks. ROSS GAY : I had to clear the deck. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : You're like, I've got too much of a backlog. ROSS GAY : Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that was something. Like, my sort of attention got cultivated. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : When you spent that little time every day focusing just on that thing that made you feel love... ROSS GAY : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : ...Delight - did it affect the rest of your day? ROSS GAY : Absolutely. I mean, the thing that I - I also discovered in the course of writing this is that so much of what, to me, sort of inspired or uncovered or unveiled delight was so often personal interactions. So I became acutely aware that delight is sort of a manifestation of interdependence. You know? ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Yeah. ROSS GAY : Like, the simple and the subtle and the almost accidental - but that's the wrong word - kindnesses that we're constantly in the midst of. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Like, one of them that you write about is a high-five from a stranger. ROSS GAY : Totally. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : You want to read an excerpt from that? \n\n ###",

ROSS GAY : (Reading) So I settled into a coffee shop, took my notebooks out and I was reading over these delights - transcribing them into my computer. And while I was working - headphones on, swaying to the new De La Soul record \"Delight\" - which deserves its own entry - I noticed a white girl. She looked 15 but could have been, I suppose, a college student, standing next to me with her hand raised. I looked up, confused - pulled my headphones back. And she said, like a coach or something, working on your paper? Good job to you - high-five. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : (Laughter). ROSS GAY : (Reading) And you better believe I high-fived that child in her pre-ripped Def Leppard shirt and her itty-bitty Doc Martins, for I love - I delight in unequivocally pleasant public physical interactions with strangers. What constitutes pleasant, it's no secret, is informed by my largish, male and cisgender body - a body that is also largish, male, cisgender and not white. In other words, the pleasant - the delightful are not universal. We should all understand this by now. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : I feel like I get to know you so well reading this, almost more than I would if I read a memoir or an autobiography because it's like I don't need to know where you went to high school... ROSS GAY : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : ...Or what your passions were as a kid. I know that you love working in your garden. I know what preoccupies your thoughts. It feels very intimate. ROSS GAY : Yeah. I think the dailiness of it makes it like that. You do something every day and, like - and it's small and sort of apparently - or previously insignificant things that - boom - you get the chance to meditate on. You know? ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Yeah. ROSS GAY : I have this one in my book about bindweed. And bindweed is like... ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Which is a terrible... ROSS GAY : Yes, yes. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : ...Plague in a garden. People hate it. ROSS GAY : And I'm like, well, I've got to go for it. You know? I guess I'm thinking about bindweed. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Will you read a little bit of that one? ROSS GAY : Yeah, totally. ROSS GAY : It's \"Bindweed... Delight?\" is the title. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Question mark. ROSS GAY : Yeah. ROSS GAY : (Reading) There are gardeners reading this who are likely thinking that if I try to turn bindweed, that most destructive, noxious, invasive, life-destroying plant into a delight, they will bind me and poor glyphosate down my throat. That might be overstatement. All the same, it is a cloying glass half-fullness to wrangle bindweed into a delight - though I'm going for it. Shortly after having spent about 20 minutes pulling it from my newly planted mound of five sweet meat squash - yes, sweet meat; try to say that without smiling - out near the woodpile. Already coming up in that mound is all the buckwheat and clover I planted, which, along with the hopefully soon-to-be-thorough coverage of the sweet meat foliage, might crowd out the bindweed. You are right to observe in me the desire not to live with bindweed, which does not in the least negate or supersede my desire to make living with bindweed, which I do, OK. \n\n ###",

So the book includes the presidential election, the inauguration, huge news-dominating events. And you're writing about a hummingbird or a pawpaw patch. ROSS GAY : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : I can imagine those huge events in the news that were so dominating so much of our attention might not have caused you a lot of delight. ROSS GAY : Oh, God. Yeah, exactly. And I think, again, that's something that sort of shows in the book. Like, you can see that pull to sort of, like, get completely floored. And I think it's an interesting tension to be like, I'm trying; I'm trying to keep the light. Like, this is my focus right now. This is my discipline. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Will you read from one of these essays called \"The Sanctity Of Trains\"? ROSS GAY : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : You write about how people leave their bags unattended, trusting that nobody will take them. And then this is the conclusion of that essay. ROSS GAY : Yeah. ROSS GAY : (Reading) I suppose I could spend time theorizing how it is that people are not bad to each other. But that's really not the point. The point is that in almost every instance of our social lives, we are, if we pay attention, in the midst of an almost constant, if subtle, caretaking - holding doors open, offering elbows at crosswalks, letting someone else go first, helping with the heavy bags, reaching what's too high or what's been dropped, pulling someone back to their feet, stopping at the car wreck - at the struck dog, the alternating merge, also known as the zipper. This caretaking is our default mode, and it's always a lie that convinces us to act or believe otherwise - always. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : That second always made me wonder if you're convincing or reminding yourself of something you don't always feel. ROSS GAY : Reminding - I think reminding, for sure. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : How often do you need that reminder, that second always? ROSS GAY : Often. And you know, thankfully, I have beloved friends, you know? I have reminders. And I feel like part of this thing, this project of this book is training myself that the reminders are everywhere. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : So you wrote the last of these essays in August of 2017. It was your birthday, just as it was when you started this project. ROSS GAY : Yeah. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : And then what happened? ROSS GAY : I think I sort of felt like this is something that I'll be doing in one way or another for the rest of my life. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Do you mean in a literal, practical way - like, continuing to write these essays? ROSS GAY : Well, not necessarily continuing to write these essays. But this book sort of really helped me to clarify that my objective in my work is to sort of study joy complicatedly. But that sort of impulse to try to identify what it is that connects us and what it is that is evidence of our interdependence, that's the thing I'm curious about - and how my work and how my looking can help to sort of grow that. And I feel like that's something that I sort of was able to articulate in this book. And so you know, the next books I'm working on - already, I have a couple books that I'm working on - I can see, like, oh, OK. You're studying how we can love each other better.

The lawsuit accuses the newspaper of bullying the student, Nicholas Sandmann, with, quote, \"a modern form of McCarthyism.\" ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : A controversial video showed Sandmann standing across from a Native American activist during a protest march. Later, context revealed a much more complex picture of those events. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Derigan Silver is a media law professor at the University of Denver. Welcome. DERIGAN SILVER : Thanks for having me, Ari. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : What is your initial impression of this lawsuit? DERIGAN SILVER : It's a long and complex lawsuit. It involves seven different articles written by The Washington Post, as well as a number of tweets by The Washington Post. And it brings up some very interesting kind of points about McCarthyism, as you mentioned. And the damages it seeks are sort of an interesting sort of calculation of damages. So it's a pretty complicated lawsuit. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Now, media organizations have a lot of protection under the First Amendment. So what is required for this kind of lawsuit to succeed? DERIGAN SILVER : Well, a lot of it depends on the type of plaintiff that you are defending. And so the question will become, what type of plaintiff is this high school student? Is he - he's clearly not what we call a public official, somebody who works for the United States government or an elected official. He is probably not what is called an all-purpose public figure, which means that he is somebody who is widely known, has widespread fame or notoriety, or he has continuing news value. DERIGAN SILVER : What the courts might decide is he's a type of plaintiff which is called a limited-purpose public figure. And what kind of burden of proof does that place on the media organization when they're defending themselves in a lawsuit? ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Because the media has more liberty to write things about a president of the United States than they do about some ordinary civilian who's not in the public eye. DERIGAN SILVER : Exactly. The Supreme Court has said that defamation lawsuits are really a balancing act. We balance your right to freedom of expression, Ari, as a reporter or as an individual against my right to reputation - my right to my good name. And in normal situations where we're dealing with a private individual, well, the scales may tip a little bit more in favor of that private individual than they would in favor of you as a reporter. DERIGAN SILVER : But when we're dealing with anybody who is a limited-purpose public figure or an all-purpose public figure or a public official, well, then the scales are going to tip in favor of you, Ari, because the public has more of a legitimate interest in knowing what is going on with these individuals than it does in knowing what is going on with me as a private individual. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Social media is so central to this story. It's a key part of this lawsuit, and it's a key part of how this narrative spread, allowing people to jump to conclusions really quickly. How does that change the way a lawsuit like this plays out? DERIGAN SILVER : It's complicated. We're taking law that developed in the 1800s or really reached the Supreme Court in the 1960s. And we're trying to take that old law, and we're trying to apply it to these very new, very novel situations. DERIGAN SILVER : You know, it used to be that the damage to your reputation was measured by your sort of standing in your local community. But now, when we have information spreading over the Internet, it sort of calls into question, where did the damage happen? What is your community? DERIGAN SILVER : And the court has said that we're not going to create brand-new law for these areas. So we're going to take this law that was developed for the printing press, and we're going to take this law that was developed for broadcast news, and we're going to sort of try to shoehorn it into situations that are presented to us by social media. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST : Let's take a step back for a moment. President Trump has talked about his wish to see libel laws changed to make it easier to sue media organizations. Just yesterday, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent arguing that a case siding with The New York Times in such a lawsuit was wrongly decided. What do you make of the broader landscape right now? DERIGAN SILVER : These are very, very visible individuals with a lot of power in our society calling into question the basic function of one of our fundamental institutions of democracy, and that is the press. DERIGAN SILVER : And I think that those of us who believe that the press is a power of good and is a democratic necessity need to sort of stand up and start pushing back on this rhetoric and really saying, no. Just because you don't like a story doesn't make it fake news. Just because you don't agree with how you're being covered and you don't like the coverage doesn't make it a false statement.

The women were extras in Hulu TV's adaptation of Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : As NPR's Lynn Neary reports, they were filming a scene for the upcoming season. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : There was a lot going on at the Lincoln Memorial that day. Tourists were being ushered into the monument by some members of the film crew... LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Anybody want to go up? LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: We're open, guys. You're more than welcome to... LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Up the steps, and off you go. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : ...While others were getting ready to shoot the scene. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK, handmaids, let's do another kneeling rehearsal. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is set in Gilead, a fictional country ruled by religious extremists. Fertile women, known as handmaids, are forced to become surrogate mothers for the rulers and their infertile wives. So the sight of these red-caped women on the steps of this majestic, white monument to freedom was chilling. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK, good morning, handmaids.

KIM TODD : We will replicate those with our visual effects so that the final shot will have thousands of handmaids stretching down the Mall between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : As rehearsal gets underway, the women stand in rows, their heads bowed down, facing the ground. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That's pretty good. OK. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go, and kneel. And you'll do the action, OK? So here we go. And kneel. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : The women kneel in unison, their faces completely obscured by their winged caps. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : Anna Tummarello (ph) says wearing that cap makes you feel ashamed. ANNA TUMMARELLO : We were talking on the ride over on the bus about how just humbling it is. You can't make eye contact with anybody for a few minutes after you first put it on. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE : But Amy Shea (ph) says she gets a different feeling when she's surrounded by the other handmaids. AMY SHEA : It kind of feels powerful, too, in a way. AMY SHEA : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah, it feels powerful, which is very ironic... \n\n ###",

He's learning firsthand how tough it can be to turn Internet fame into money. Stacey Vanek Smith and Shane McKeon from our Planet Money Indicator team say his dilemma can be described in a single sentence. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Backpack Kid is suing Fortnite for stealing The Floss. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : That does not make sense. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : I think we should just take this one noun at a time. So let's start with Backpack Kid. He is this skinny teenager with long, bony arms... STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And a backpack. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : ...And a backpack. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : OK. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : And a few years ago, he's living in Georgia, posting videos of himself dancing on Instagram when, all of a sudden, one of these videos goes viral. And it's so popular that Katy Perry invites him on \"SNL\" to do the dance. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Whoa. That sentence I understand. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : The kid took the stage as Katy Perry performed and, in about two seconds, took over the show. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : So this dance that he is doing - it's called flossing. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Yes. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : This is The Floss. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : The Floss. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : OK. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : And it's this dance where you sort of take your arms, and you swing them to and fro. And you're sort of flossing your hips. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : (Laughter). SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Anyway, the thing you have to know about Backpack Kid... STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Yes. \n\n ###",

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And that brings us to the next part of the sentence. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Fortnite. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Fortnite. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : So Fortnite - it's like this online, multiplayer, battle royale game. You're on a team, and you're trying to shoot the other team. But one of the things you can do in Fortnite is you can do these dances like The Floss. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Wow. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : Fortnite is owned by this company called Epic Games. And one of the major ways Epic Games makes money off of Fortnite is by selling these dance upgrades. And so Backpack Kid - right? - he looks at Fortnite, and he sees this company making a ton of money... STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Yeah. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : ...By selling the dance he made famous. And he's like, I want some of that action. And so Backpack Kid is suing Epic Games, and some lawyers have gotten involved. DAVID HECHT : So if we were talking about music... SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : This is David Hecht. He's one of Backpack Kid's lawyers. DAVID HECHT : If you had a song and they sampled from another song, we would say that that's copyright infringement. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : And so Backpack Kid has filed for some copyrights, at least one of which has been granted. But that doesn't mean he owns that arm-swinging move that all the kids are doing. JESSICA LITMAN : The copyright statute does protect what the statute calls choreographic works. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : This is Jessica Litman. She teaches law at the University of Michigan. JESSICA LITMAN : But it doesn't protect building blocks like dance steps. SHANE MCKEON, BYLINE : A choreographic work - a sequence of lots of moves performed over time, so, like, a 40-minute ballet. But a single dance move - that, Litman says, is a building block. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And if you grant copyright protection for a single dance move, it could lead to some pretty weird scenarios. JESSICA LITMAN : Whenever anyone performed The Floss on the dance floor in a club, Backpack Kid could bring suit against the club. The club would have to say to people don't wave your arms. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : The courts are going to have to decide, what does Backpack Kid actually own? And what is Epic using? Is it a dance move or an entire dance? The answer to these questions will determine what Epic owes Backpack Kid, if Epic owes Backpack Kid anything. Epic Games declined to comment. \n\n ###",

They'll consider priests who abused children, bishops who cover up for them and how the Catholic Church should address these problems. This is the first summit of its kind. But as NPR's Tom Gjelten reports, it may leave Catholics in the U.S. disappointed. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : It was clear in the U.S. before it was in other countries that abusive priests are everywhere. And though church leaders here have been notoriously slow in responding to the crisis, at least they came up with some plan to deal with it. It wasn't very ambitious, and it would have been hard to enforce under church law. Even so, the U.S. bishops were not happy when their reforms were blocked by Pope Francis. DANIEL DINARDO : Proposals were not received as well by the Holy See last November, as you know, and though we're disappointed - but we continue to work, and we hope that the meeting will be of help. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : The president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, speaking recently at the Catholic University of America. With Pope Francis taking the reform initiative away from U.S. bishops, he's now facing the demands of abuse survivors on his own. Several of them, including Becky Ianni, showed up this month at a locked gate outside the Vatican Embassy in Washington. BECKY IANNI : Hello. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : Yes. BECKY IANNI : We have a letter that we would like to drop off that we would like to go to Pope Francis. May we come in and deliver it? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : OK. Do you have an appointment with us? BECKY IANNI : No, we don't. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Ianni, who was sexually violated by her family priest as a 9-year-old girl is now a leader of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. She says her group has moved beyond pursuing individual bad priests and are focusing on the bishops who haven't done anything about the abusers. BECKY IANNI : Those people, to me, are the bigger criminals. They covered up the abuse, and they allowed more and more children to be put in harm's way. And that breaks my heart. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Reformers have had some success. Catholic dioceses around the country, for example, have identified abusive priests by name. Victim advocates like Ianni still want more, which is why they addressed their letter personally to Pope Francis. BECKY IANNI : Cardinals and bishops can't control each other. So if something's going to happen, it's going to have to come from Pope Francis. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : But it's not clear the pope will see these U.S. concerns about bishop accountability as a summit priority. Catholic leaders in some other countries don't even recognize the scope of the clergy abuse crisis yet. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Father Tom Reese, a Jesuit priest and commentator for the Religion News Service, thinks the pope's main goal at this summit is simply to educate the bishops attending from these other countries. TOM REESE : The most important purpose of this meeting is to hammer these bishops and get them to realize how important and critical an issue this is and go home to their countries and communicate that to the rest of the bishops and get their acts together and deal with this problem of abuse. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : A worthwhile goal, but will it satisfy? KATHLEEN SPROWS CUMMINGS : That offers little solace to American Catholics who feel their own church is in need of reform. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Kathleen Sprows Cummings directs the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at Notre Dame. She notes that U.S. Catholics have become so angered over their church's failure to get to the bottom of the clergy abuse crisis that they're turning to civil law enforcement authorities to do the investigative work. In several states, attorneys general are demanding that church officials turn over any information they may have on misconduct by priests or bishops. Cummings says this is where the action is now. KATHLEEN SPROWS CUMMINGS : I would love for the church to commit to saying, we're going to find out what happened and come to a reckoning of this. I don't see that happening. And at this point, I think we have to look to the civil authorities to do that. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : If you're just joining us, we've been talking economics with reporter Keith Reed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, let us pick up with payroll reports. So a recent report shows that employers created 166,000 jobs last month. That's the fastest pace of job growth since last spring and more than double what economists predicted. So how significant is this and why do you think these surprise numbers? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : I think it is significant. And many people were surprised because you really saw - particularly in the retail sector back in October, you saw a pretty big drop in employment in that sector. And that's because many of the retailers fear that some of the trouble in the credit markets and some of the trouble in the housing markets were going to affect the larger economy and people weren't going to be spending. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : So when you came out and you saw economists really, really worried about the business climate and about this credit situation, that you saw a higher-than-expected job growth that surprised a lot of people. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So when you think about the housing slump and the credit crunch, does this basically - is this kind of like acid neutralizer for the bad news that's been going on? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : No, I don't think that it is, and for a few reasons. Number one, you have to look at where these jobs are being added. Number two, you have to take some of these job growths - some of the job growth that we've seen and look at it in a larger context, i.e., how many jobs were lost before you got to the larger job growth. We've seen pretty slow job growth for a while. And then, all of a sudden, you had a higher-than-expected job growth. But because it was slow for a long time, you've got to still try to make up some of the, you know, try to regain some of the jobs that were lost or some of the jobs that we should have been adding. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : Then you also have to look at where the jobs are coming from. In other words, these jobs aren't very, you know, we're seeing more jobs but we're not seeing high-paid jobs. We're seeing jobs in relatively low-pay, low-skill sectors -particularly services, hotel and restaurant workers, those sorts of jobs. Those jobs are not going to - over the long term - sustain the economy and sustain what really has been keeping the economy afloat over the last year and a half, two years, which is the retail sector itself. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now I want to move on to another bit of job news. Chrysler announced it's going to cut thousands of jobs in 2008 - about 15 percent of the workforce. Those come on top of 13,000 layoffs made earlier this year. Give us a sense of the lay of the land in the auto industry, because you have the UAW, the union passing a new four-year contract. Is this a surprise? What's going on in the industry at large? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : This is the worst fear of many of the UAW members and negotiators coming true, which we had was a situation where - at Chrysler and with some of the other autoworkers out there. They've been negotiating their new labor deals. And one of the biggest fears was that if they granted the - the autoworkers granted the concessions that the automakers wanted, that the automakers would then turn around and lay some of their people off. And that's absolutely what happened. I would - there's not much that they can do at this point because they've now signed a new deal. I'm not really sure how they can -how the autoworkers can - the union can go back and address these issues. But it certainly has to be a strong bone of contention within the unions and also between the unions and the major automakers up in Detroit right now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now Chrysler became a private company in August. It went into the hands of a large investment group. How do you think that's going to shape the lay of the land for them? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : I think we're still waiting to see. I mean, clearly, one of the things that Chrysler did was it cut four new - four of its models from its line. Some of those models were based on underpinnings, based on the chassis, the engine, all those sorts of things - designs that were - that they'd use from Mercedes Benz. There were the, you know, had disagreements sort of going on when the two companies were one, that Chrysler would be able to take some of the designs and some of the better workmanship from Mercedes Benz and use it in their car lineup. Now they're eliminating some of those models. What is Chrysler going to do to be able to come back and put some models out there that have that same level of quality and that same level of appeal that the American consumer, over the last few years, have come to expect from Chrysler? That's going to be a big question for them out there over the next few years. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we have the retailers holiday shopping. Months and months and months of prep for this season - that makes so much money for retailers. There was something called Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which was when, supposedly, retailers went in to the black, meaning, that they recouped all of the expenditures for the year. But now, if you go into some stores, you basically went from Halloween to Christmas in an instant. What's happened here? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : What's happened is - as I referred to earlier - that retail has really been keeping the economy afloat. But people - retailers, particularly -were afraid that this year, they were going to see a tough season. People weren't expected to spend as much money as they were in previous years. And that's because, you know, they haven't been able to borrow much of the spending that's been going on. And the retail economy has really been become - because people have been borrowing money, either taking - using their credit cards or taking out home equity loans. There was a general psychology of good feeling based on the fact that, hey, my house is worth 20 percent more than it was last year or 50 percent more than it was last year. Well, this year, that has gone away. And so the consumer now isn't expected to spend as much money as they would have. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : So consequently, that means that the retailer has to extend its own holiday shopping season in order to be able to make as much money and get in to the Black. They don't think that starting in November right after Thanksgiving and going through Christmas is going to take them where they need to go in terms of hitting their revenue and their profit numbers for this year. So they had to step it up and bring it up really right after Thanksgiving. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Keith, one estimate is that Americans are going to spend 4 percent less this holiday season than last holiday season. Obviously, that will cut in to shop owners' pockets. But who else could it affect? Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : Well, it could affect almost all of us, really, Farai. I mean, if you think about - again, where some of these job - some of the job growth is happening in the retail sector. You saw a little bit of the hiring back. They laid off - they've already laid off a bunch of people again a couple of months ago, expecting that their sales were going to be down in the fourth quarter. Well, many people depend on those jobs. I mean, if you are one of those people who depends on a retail job, and you know that, you know, you've got to feed your family. You need that money to be able to pay your rent. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : Everything in this economy is pretty much tied to how much money people are spending. And if people aren't spending the money, then the retailers can't do the hiring and then if retailers can't do the hiring, that leaves people out on the street, who then in turn can't do what? Spend more money to help keep the economy afloat. So this could affect - long term - many, many more people than just the Wal-Marts and the KB Toy stores of the world. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Keith, thanks a lot. Mr. KEITH REED (Economics Reporter) : Thank you. \n\n ###",

I was there in Helsinki when Trump was pressed about Putin's claims not to have intervened in the 2016 election. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : That was last summer. Now comes a new claim from former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired from the Trump administration. He's now on book tour. His claim is that President Trump takes the same approach, elevating Putin's word above that of his own intelligence chiefs in closed-door meetings at the White House. McCabe told NPR this presents a challenge for the intelligence officials who serve the president. ANDREW MCCABE : How do we impart wisdom and knowledge and the best of our intelligence assessments to someone who chooses to believe our adversaries over our intelligence professionals? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I want to bring in someone with long experience of delivering intelligence assessments to presidents of both parties. John McLaughlin is former acting director of the CIA. Welcome. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : Thanks, Mary Louise. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : So the context of that quote we just heard from Andrew McCabe was a briefing for the president about Russian intelligence operations in the U.S. And McCabe told us it went off the rails, that the president changed the subject to North Korea and said he did not believe reports of missiles recently launched by North Korea. And when asked why, the president said it was because Putin told U.S. intelligence was wrong. Now, McCabe says that when he heard about this conversation, his head spun. Does yours, John McLaughlin? How plausible do you find this account? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : Well, if it is as described, it's of course disturbing. It's a complicated issue, to be sure. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Sure. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : And it's certainly fair for a president to question American intelligence assessments because that typically makes them better when you have a back and forth and so forth. But I'm not aware of any instance in which an American president has said, basically, I trust our adversary more than I trust what I'm hearing from you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : On the Russia question, more than two years into the Trump presidency, are we any closer in your view to understanding why President Trump defers to Putin? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : It remains a puzzle. I have thought about the words he used that you heard in Helsinki when he said that President Putin was very strong in his denial. It sounds to me just based on those words - like, Putin is a former case officer. He's a skilled intelligence officer. He's been trained and has had a lot of practice in persuading someone who is easily persuaded. I don't know how else to read it. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You're saying President Trump is being briefed by an intelligence officer just not one who works for the U.S. government. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : Exactly. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : This is reminding me of another situation that played out in public view last month, the annual threat assessment testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The heads of the FBI and the CIA and the director of National Intelligence all got up and delivered assessments of all kinds of threats - North Korea, Iran, Syria and so on - assessments that are at odds with public comments the president has made. However, they never came out and directly said, hey, Mr. President, you're wrong. Are we at a point where, in your view, they should? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : I don't think I would put it that way. I'm actually very proud of the way they handled themselves. They have a duty to do exactly what they did, and that is to say as clearly and unequivocally what they believed to be true and factually supported. I don't think it's their job to publicly correct him. It's their job to publicly say what they believed to be true. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : But when the president is saying something that is not supported by the facts, you don't think they have a responsibility greater than to the president, to the American public. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : You know, I've been in that position myself. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I know. That's why I'm asking you. JOHN MCLAUGHLIN : Yeah. And I think it's very important, and I believe they do this - that it's important that they say to the president privately - that they say he's wrong. And I'm pretty confident they do that. \n\n ###",

Harvard economist Ken Rogoff does not want to get rid of cash, but he does see problems with it. So we called him to ask why and ask what getting rid of cash would mean to our society. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Professor Rogoff, hey there. KEN ROGOFF : Greetings. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Greetings to you. So as we just heard from that 70 percent figure, a lot of us still like cash. You can touch it. It's easy. You don't like cash. Why not? KEN ROGOFF : Well, what I object to is people buying apartments in Trump Tower with suitcases of cash, buying $50,000 cars, engaged, of course, in drug transactions, human trafficking, whatever. A lot of people have perfectly healthy, good uses for cash. I have no moral objections to it. And I think for small transactions, it's still a big deal. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Yeah. You can't tip your housekeeper at a hotel if you don't have, you know, five bucks on hand or 20 bucks or whatever. You can't do it with a debit card. KEN ROGOFF : Not in our country, anyway - in Sweden, maybe you can. But yes. But the question is, most of our cash is in $100 bills. And I don't know about you and your friends, but most of mine do not have $1,000 worth of $100 bills in their family of four. And that's really, I think, where a rethinking is needed. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : How much should we be worried about some Americans being left behind in a cashless society? KEN ROGOFF : If we literally go cashless, then obviously, it would be a problem. But I don't think anyone, even the Swedes, are talking about that. It's really reducing the amount of cash. By the way, something a number of countries have already done - and we should do - is give people free debit accounts. You could save a lot of money because most of the low-income people who'd be getting free debit accounts, the government's transferring money to anyway. And it's kind of expensive to process the checks. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You mentioned Sweden. They are way farther along this path towards a cashless society than the U.S. is. We had a story out of Sweden recently on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, where there were mixed views - some Swedes feeling like this is maybe going too far, too fast; others feeling like, what's the problem? - especially the younger generation. Do you think Sweden is where the U.S. is headed? Is that our future? KEN ROGOFF : We are already where Sweden was, say, five or seven years ago. And in another five or seven years, we will be where Sweden is today. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Meaning what? How will our daily lives look different, do you think? KEN ROGOFF : Well, I already stand in line at Starbucks in Harvard Square. And when I get to the front of the line, I'm the only one using cash. I'm old. I still use it. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : (Laughter). KEN ROGOFF : I think it'll look more and more like that in many places. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : What should we be doing, as a society, to get ready for this other than - I don't know - charging up our Apple apps and our debit cards? KEN ROGOFF : Most people will be able to adjust at the pace that they want to. There are these new technologies that I can't even keep up with even though I work on the topic. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Do you have a Venmo account, may I ask? KEN ROGOFF : My children do. I don't. Otherwise, they'd want me to Venmo them money all the time.

Larry is currently the senior black correspondent on \"The Daily Show.\" His writing credits include \"The Bernie Mac Show,\" \"The Office,\" \"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"In Living Color.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hey, Larry.

Mr. LARRY WILMORE (Writer; Member, Writers Guild Negotiating Committee, Writers Guild of America) : Well, right now, for instance, I just sold a show to HBO that I will be writing and acting. And then I can't develop it right now because of the strike. So until the strike is resolved, I won't be able to take any meetings about it. I can't write at home on it. I'm not allowed to do any work on it, or even meet with them. I - we haven't even talked about the story for it yet, so I can't move forward on it at all until the strike is resolved.

In fact, that's what gives those shows that spontaneities when the performer has that material and they can, you know, sometimes they can adlib from there whatever but they have that comfort of having that material under them. Mr. LARRY WILMORE (Writer; Member, Writers Guild Negotiating Committee, Writers Guild of America) : And you have shows like Jay Leno and David Letterman, like Letterman's Top Ten List and, you know, all of Leno's stuff. They - I think they're both shutting down. They can't really do anything. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Television has so many different aspects to it. There is the issue of who actually writes the material. Mr. LARRY WILMORE (Writer; Member, Writers Guild Negotiating Committee, Writers Guild of America) : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And African-Americans haven't been highly represented in that question of who watches. And black Americans have been, in some ways, overrepresented in that. And then, also, the question of who gets paid for what. Mr. LARRY WILMORE (Writer; Member, Writers Guild Negotiating Committee, Writers Guild of America) : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : We got a statement from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. They didn't make themselves available to come on and they said, we made an attempt at meeting them - meaning, you guys - in a number of their key areas including Internet streaming and jurisdiction in new media. Ultimately, the guild was unwilling to compromise on most of their major demands. It is unfortunate that they chose to take this irresponsible action. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What's actually on the table when we talk about DVD, new media, Internet streaming? What's the beef about between these two guilds? Mr. LARRY WILMORE (Writer; Member, Writers Guild Negotiating Committee, Writers Guild of America) : When the companies say that, I mean, it's very disingenuous for them to say that. I mean, they had about 75 rolled bags on the table, you know. So it's like someone, you know, stealing your car and then giving you back your car radio and saying, hey, come on, we've made a move, you know. Why aren't you making a move? But you took our car.

But scores of prominent people including Colin Powell argue that leadership is learned, so apparently does media mogul Oprah Winfrey. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : She founded a girls' leadership academy near Johannesburg, South Africa. But last week, claims of child abuse surfaced at Winfrey's Academy for Girls. One dorm matron faces 13 charges of indecent assault and injury for allegedly harming at least six students. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : During a press conference yesterday, Oprah Winfrey said she was devastated by the news and is conducting a private investigation. She also praised the students who reported the abuse. Ms. OPRAH WINFREY (Founder, Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls) : They represent, those 15 girls, the new generation of youth in South Africa who fearlessly take back their voices to speak up about their concern for their fellow classmates. This is really what we're trying to teach. This is what leadership is all about - to use your voice no matter what the personal consequences, so that abuse will end and good will prevail. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Here with more is Newsweek national correspondent Allison Samuels. Hey, Allison Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Hey. How are you doing? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you visited the school and you saw Oprah interview people who wanted to work for the school. What do you think went wrong here? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : I think the main thing is that she hired people for the higher-up positions, for the sort of main positions, and I think she allowed them to choose the people who were sort of more the regular, you know, sort of dorm matron, for example. She didn't hire those people exactly. She hired the people on top. And I think that, you know, inevitably, you're going to have a bad apple. I think no matter how much you interview people or how many references they get, you can't be sure that everyone is going to be the right person. And, unfortunately, it has only been a year. It hasn't even been a year for the school. So I think that's the disadvantage of what's going on. And let's be clear, she's half a world away which makes it very hard for her to sort of monitor who's doing what. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : And also you're looking at girls who are mostly orphans, so I think, unfortunately, people can take advantage of girls like that because they feel like, who are they going to tell, but really - clearly, they did tell someone. But I'm sure that that was sort of the feeling of these girls are worlds away from their home, you know, I can do what I want to do and it's not going to get back. But, obviously, that's not the case. So - for Oprah, I feel bad for her because I know she went through a lot of effort and time to get the girls and the staff. And for this to happen less than year before the, you know, before the year anniversary, I can only imagine how devastated she is. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What do you think of her response and the press conference? Was it, in some ways, overkill and reverberating the story - not that people weren't paying attention. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Was this the kind of thing that actually laid out her plans and her vision or did it draw more attention to this? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : Well, I don't think the story was going to go away because it's Oprah. And let's be clear, she took such a hit when she opened the school. People were so critical about why did she open it up there and why she doesn't do more here. I think that she had to sort of answer, hey, I did it. I'm not apologizing for it, but this is what went wrong, and this is how I fix it. I think she had to sort of be pro-active on that because I think the story was not going to go away without her sort of explaining how this might have gone wrong. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : And also you have to see those girls. Those girls have already been through so much, had already been so damaged. I think she felt very strongly about saying, I'm going to help these girls get over this and move on. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There have already been other conversations reported that the parents of the students have complained that the school is too strict and they have too little access to their children - obviously, the children who are not orphans - what do you make of those allegations and were those mainly cleared up before this happened? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : I think that this is a work-in-progress. I mean, you know, she just opened the school. It hasn't been a year. I think this was something that - this is an undertaking no one's really done before there. So I think it's a lot of trial and error. And, you know, I could tell from what she was doing that it was going to be a strict school because there are so many activities she has them involved in. There are so many classes that they're taking. She's trying to expose them to so much, I think it doesn't really allow for them to go out much or to have people come in to visit them, particularly in the beginning. I think she's - because she's taken these kids away from their home base. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : And I think she was concerned that if they spend too much time with other people, they wouldn't able to handle being away. So I think there is a method to what she's trying to do, but I think the main thing is just trial and error. And, unfortunately, this has been a very hard year; some hard lessons for her. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, the woman who is accused of these molestations and attacks says that she didn't do it. Would Oprah run a risk of actually getting into legal - reverse legal action from someone like that? Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : I mean, I - obviously, if she didn't do it, I mean, it's going to trial. So I would think that, at the end of the day, they're going to have to try - they're going to have to prove it: the investigators - and Oprah's hired her own investigators. But it's hard for me to imagine that after everything that's happened that they didn't pinpoint the person that is at least somewhat responsible for it. I think that given that South Africa is investigating and Oprah has her own people, I have to believe that they sort of narrowed it down to the right person at this point. Ms. ALLISON SAMUELS (National Correspondent, Newsweek) : We shall see, but I think the investigation is in continuing. So I think she's being clear. She doesn't want to have that happen where it's not the right person. I mean, because those girls are still in that school; she doesn't need this to happen again. So she has to make extra sure she has the person, you know, that's responsible for it. So I don't at all think that she has the wrong person. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It's time now for our Africa update. Today, sisters are doing it for themselves. We're talking about the women leaders of Africa. Yesterday, President Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to seven people including Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. She is the first woman elected to head an African country. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : President GEORGE W. BUSH: All her life, President Sirleaf has been a pioneer. The daughter of a school teacher in Monrovia, she crossed the ocean as a young woman and earned three degrees in the United States. She's been a business executive, a development expert, a public official and always a patriot. She loves Liberia, and she loves all its people. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So how much progress have women made in leadership across the continent? We've got Emira Woods to give us some perspective. She is co-director of Foreign Policy in Focus at the Institute of Policies Studies. Hi, Emira. Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : How are you, Farai? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. So you're from Liberia. What does this honor mean for your country? Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : Well, it is extraordinary that Liberia, after a history of 26 years of war, emerges with Africa's first woman president. And we are really happy to have, not only the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded to Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, but, you know, of high distinction of addressing both members of Congress and a number of distinctions coming her way. So it's exciting. Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : But it is, Farai, really, on the symbolic end. And what we're hoping for as Liberians and member of African community overall is that these symbolic measures are actually backed up by concrete actions on debt cancellation for Liberia and on other real concrete steps that the Bush administration can take to actually impact women's lives in Liberia and around the continent. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, before Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf was elected president in 2006, how was the balance of power in terms of gender? Were there a lot of female elected officials or female leaders in Liberia? Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : Well, you know, Liberia has a mixed history. Back in the 1960s, Liberia was actually one of the first countries to send a woman to the United Nations as United Nations ambassador, so by - in, like, 1967, '68, Liberia was represented by a woman at the U.N. So there have been some incredible instances of women's political leadership and there - those have also followed in civil society throughout Liberia. There have been instances of women leaders. Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : However, over the past years, it has been men dominating and, in particular, the Samuel Does, the Charles Taylors - some really ruthless men dominating the political scene in Liberia. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Is there a program akin to affirmative action in the U.S. that deals with any of these gender issues? Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : Well, there is beginning to be discussion of that, and it is happening in some ways in Liberia both looking at the legislator and changes that can be put in place to help bring about a greater participation of women in political office. But that's just beginning in Liberia. I think there are many other countries that are much further along in terms of affirmative action through constitutional changes and other party political changes that have been taking place. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, let's move on to Rwanda. It's a nation that's rebuilding itself after genocide. And now, women make up nearly half of parliament. That is more than any other parliamentary body in the world. What's behind the trend? Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : It is absolutely extraordinary to see what has happened. Most people assumed that, you know, the men were killed in the genocide. But if you look at the numbers, actually, the population of women is about 50 percent. And the population of women reflected in parliament is about 50 percent. So it isn't reflective of any dramatic changes in the population. But it is women's political leadership at all levels that's emerging because there was a commitment made right after the genocide, essentially, to change the constitution, to change the political party structures, to put in place concrete quotas for women. Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : And so you see at every level - from municipal to regional to national elections - you see a space being opened for women. Thirty percent in many cases, women mandated in these posts as candidates and it carries forward that as women are learning leadership roles at those local levels, they continue to advance their leadership all the way through to the national level. And this is what you see reflected with 50 percent of their parliament controlled by women. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Are there any specific ways in which women have helped shape the destiny of Rwanda after the war? Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : Well, that's been the enormous potential here of women's political leadership. If you see the research that's been done on Rwanda, in particular, indicates that there are changes in women's impact in broader processes. So there is greater funding for health, for education. Those essential services needed to have healthy, sustainable lives. You see a greater amount of the national budget being directed at those essential services. Ms. EMIRA WOODS (Co-director, Foreign Policy in Focus, Institute of Policy Studies) : So, you know, I think when we look at Rwanda and other countries like Rwanda that have made this commitment to women's political leadership, we see the potential of women, not only impacting the political processes, but impacting the very nature of people's lives at the household level through these policies that are being put in place. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, moving on again to South Africa. There's another rise in women leaders. There's also been some legislation that has allowed that to happen or encouraged that to happen. Give us a sense of that. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : The head of one of America's biggest financial management company stepped down last weekend. E. Stanley O'Neal served as the CEO for Merrill Lynch for six years before retiring. O'Neal was one of only a few black CEOs ever to be appointed by a Fortune 500 company. And under O'Neal, Merrill Lynch made some investment moves that were pretty risky even for a banking giant. So was O'Neal just being responsible leading by stepping down or did his race make him an easy target of Merrill's board of directors? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Here to talk with me now about the career and legacy of E. Stanley O'Neal, we've got Alfred Edmond Jr. He's senior vice president and editor-in-chief of Black Enterprise. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Welcome. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Mr. ALFRED EDMOND JR. (Editor-in-chief; Senior Vice President, Black Enterprise): Hey, how are you doing? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So I mentioned that O'Neal led the company into making some risky investment boost. Can you explain to me, simply, some of the decisions he made that might have led to this? Mr. EDMOND : Well, it's important to understand that O'Neal didn't make this decision in a vacuum. As you know, the whole nation is caught up in this kind of mortgage crisis in which a lot of the national institutions, including Merrill Lynch, invested in mortgage bank securities. And now you see a lot of foreclosures and mortgage problems coming on and that's having impact on all the financial services companies. In fact, O'Neal is not the only executive who's had to step down in light of all of this and there's probably going to be some more people. Mr. EDMOND : What basically happened is - I'd say that what O'Neal did wasn't really more risky than what anybody else is doing but, obviously, when you come up with a billion dollar loss that has to be explained. The simple thing is this : there are region of rejection of the loss for this particular quarter was less than half of what it turned out to be and that, I think, was the biggest, biggest deal. I don't think of it so much that he was doing more riskier deals than anyone else, but I think he sent a negative signal to the shareholders and other people observing the company, that if you say it's going to be one thing and it turned out to be twice as much, you know, maybe it's worse than we think it is. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What does it mean to have had O'Neal at the head of this investment bank? What will it mean over time, if anything, that he will no longer be the head of Merrill Lynch? Mr. EDMOND : Well, it won't mean anything that he will no longer be at the head. You know, as I've said before, these aren't jobs that last a lifetime. I mean, he did a great job up until 2006 when everybody was benefitting from the boom and the growth in mortgages and investing in mortgage bank securities. The tide, obviously, has turned in the past year, but I think the first four to five years of success as the head of Merrill Lynch is going to mean a lot more than this past year that resulted in him having to resign. The reason of this is\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So a lot more to whom? Mr. EDMOND : Say that again? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : A lot more to whom? Mr. EDMOND : To African-Americans who are setting sights on what they can accomplish both on Wall Street and in corporate American as a whole. I mean, the reality is you got a former, you know, cotton-picker from Alabama rise to run for five years, you know, one of the largest, most storied, you know, Wall Street companies. And I think what that does is send a message to other aspiring African-Americans and other minorities that at least it's possible. Mr. EDMOND : And also we're learning some lessons about what it means to be a CEO. It's a high-risked, high-reward job when you're doing well. And we all know about CEO compensation, these bonuses that they're getting, and the benefits and perks, but it's also a high-risked job in that if you have a bad year or even a bad quarter, the axe could fall on you faster than it might fall on just a rank-and-file employee in the company. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How much do African-American CEOs influenced the landscape of money and race? What I mean by that is, there are many occupations where a black people are overrepresented and other ones where black people are underrepresented including finance, if you have a black CEO, whether it's a Parson's, whether it's an O'Neal, does that mean that there's going to be ripple effect of really looking at hiring strong black candidates throughout the company or is that not necessarily the case? Mr. EDMOND : Well, I think of various company - the company and the reality is since there're still relatively few. It's hard to really draw conclusions about what the broader impact is. I mean, you're still talking about less than - even before Stanley O'Neal's resignation - less than 10 instead of Fortune 1000 is 1 percent. So it's probably too early to tell in the history of America and corporate America when you can draw some broader conclusions about what it means to have a black CEO. Mr. EDMOND : I will say that if you look at it from company to company, there are some impacts that a black CEO can have both intentionally and just symbolically a, you know, if yours is a company that has a black CEO running the company, it automatically sends a message to you as a person of color who may be striving in that company. Your perception is going to be that at least it's possible for me to advance in the company. It may not happen but it's at least possible. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : From Tupac to Genarlow to Wall Street, our blog News & Views lets you have your say on the headlines and about our show. NEWS & NOTES Web producer Geoffrey Bennett is here to tell us all about it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hey, Geoffrey. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Hey, Farai. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So on Monday's Bloggers' Roundtable, we talked about a noose that was found hanging around the neck of rapper Tupac Shakur's memorial statue. And I understand some listeners took offense to that conversation. They said so on our blog. What's up? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Yeah. They're offended not by our coverage of our story but by the bloggers reaction to it. One guest in particular thought that Tupac's statue itself was pretty funny. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Here's what happened. Ms. LIZA SABATER (Founder, Culture Kitchen) : The statue itself - did you see it? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Why don't you tell us\u2026 Ms. LIZA SABATER (Founder, Culture Kitchen) : It doesn't look like him. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Tell us a little bit about the statue. I've heard a lot of criticism of what the statue actually looks like, which is why you're laughing. Ms. LIZA SABATER (Founder, Culture Kitchen) : It looks nothing like him. GEOFFREY BENNETT : So that's what happened. So I have to say it, most people who I know saw the statue had very similar reactions, saying it looked nothing like Tupac, but, you know, his much, much older uncle. But I remember\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I believe Liza Sabater called it Uncle Ben. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Right, exactly. And on our blog, a reader named Joan Brooks(ph) said she was, quote, \"disappointed by the ignorance in school yard, giggling and name-calling.\" And a couple of other readers agreed with her. But all told, I'm sure our bloggers meant no disrespecting. GEOFFREY BENNETT : On our blog, there's a photo of the statue so people can go and look at it and make up their own minds about it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we've been covering Genarlow Wilson, the 21-year-old who was released from a Georgia prison after facing a 10-year sentence for a teen sex conviction. How's that been playing out on the blog? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Well, you know, reaction to Wilson's imprisonment and his release never reached the fever-pitch of, say, the Jena Six coverage. But on our blog and elsewhere, people seem to express a sentiment that justice for Genarlow was slow in coming and they're glad it they finally did. GEOFFREY BENNETT : One reader, Daniel Holloway(ph), summed it up this way. He wrote: This case shows the problem with trying to interpret the laws based on wording rather than intent. I'm glad Wilson was freed. Bravo to the Georgia Supreme Court, he wrote. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So we also have another installment of the online series, Speak Your Mind. \n\n ###",

DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. They're offering legislation that has been labeled a Green New Deal. And the lawmakers involved include one just arrived, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country and to the world. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Now, Ocasio-Cortez is a freshman, among the least-senior members of the House. But the self-described democratic socialist has received enormous attention since upsetting a senior New York lawmaker in a primary last year. DAVID GREENE, HOST : With dozens of co-sponsors, she presents a resolution today. It would promote wind and solar energy and call for the U.S. to have net-zero carbon emissions in 10 years. She talked about this in an NPR interview. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : The thing about a Green New Deal is that it's not an outright ban on any source of energy. And that's my opinion, as one member of Congress. And one of the big goals that we have is that we're trying to just sketch out a blueprint and work with other members to get there. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR political editor Domenico Montanaro is here and has been reading an advance copy of that blueprint - that resolution. Hi there, Domenico. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So what's it say? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : You know, this is a nonbinding resolution. And as we noted, some of what it does - you know, being carbon neutral by 2030 is one of those things that a lot of experts say is not only ambitious, but almost impossible to pull off. Experts shoot for more like 2050, and that's considered ambitious. It would also eliminate most, if not all, air travel, in fact, because of how it wants to restructure things like high-speed rail - so very ambitious - not a lot of specifics as far as how to get to those things, but certainly laying down a marker for where liberals want to go in addressing climate change. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Largely eliminate air travel, which is considered to be really bad for our planet - for carbon levels in the atmosphere, trying to get people in a different - in different direction. But you're saying it's - essentially, it's a set of notions or ideas. It would actually require big legislation later to enact these ideas. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : Yeah, or small legislation, having to enact various numbers of these ideas to flesh this out. And it's going to be a really difficult thing to actually enact as far as getting it on the floor because getting it to a vote is not something that a lot of moderate Democrats are going to be wanting to, you know, have to walk the plank on, frankly. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, well, let's talk about that. What would the reluctance be of Democratic leaders to buy into this Green New Deal notion? DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : Well, it's a plan that would cost trillions upon trillions of dollars, to be quite honest. And it's not something that would ever pass the Republican-controlled Senate. Now, you know, all of that is practical and looking at the actual politics of the day. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : Of course, liberals are going to say that this is, you know, a bold step forward that they can argue for and win people over on. And that very well may be the case. But Democrats in 2009 took a step with cap and trade, which was far less dramatic than this plan would be. It passed the House, didn't pass the Senate. And a lot of Democrats feel like they suffered some consequences along with the passage of Obamacare in the 2010 midterm elections. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : And let's remember the reason Democrats won in the 2018 midterms - while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is able to get so much attention for herself and for her - the things that she wants to do, this election was really won on the backs of moderates. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, moderates who were able to win in suburban areas that had been Republican before. DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE : Right. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Domenico, thanks so much.

The lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, is publicly accused by a woman who says he sexually assaulted her in 2004. And now the state's third-ranking official, Attorney General Mark Herring, has admitted that he donned blackface at a college party in the '80s. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Sarah McCammon, a resident of Virginia, has been following all this and is in our studio. Sarah, good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So Lieutenant Governor Fairfax has been fending off these allegations for a number of days, but now the woman who accused him has stepped forward with a written statement. What have you learned? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Right. And her name is Vanessa Tyson. We had not been naming her until yesterday, when she came forward to tell her story. She's a politics professor at Scripps College in California and currently a fellow at Stanford. And in a detailed statement, she says, quote, \"what began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault,\" she says, by Justin Fairfax. This was in 2004, she says, at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : They were both working at the convention, right? They were staying in a hotel. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : They were both there. And they met there. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : And where the story gets more complicated is it initially surfaced on a conservative blog based on a private social media post that Tyson had made where she appeared to allude to this. And she also had told her story to The Washington Post over a year ago. They checked it out, said they couldn't corroborate either version of events and decided not to publish. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : But now, she says this has all come out, and she wants to set the record straight. She says she's coming forward with tremendous anguish, though, to tell her story. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Fairfax originally said, when vaguer versions of this story were out there, this is a political smear. What is he saying now that more specific allegations are public? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : He's repeatedly denied this. And in a new statement yesterday, he says Tyson's allegations are surprising and hurtful, but he has to dispute her version of events. And he also said he wanted to emphasize how important it is to listen to women when they come forward. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : We should also note he's retained a law firm - the same one that represented Brett Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings when he was accused of sexual assault. And now the National Organization for Women is calling for Fairfax to resign. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So the big picture here - we have a governor who's been accused involving this old racist photo. We have the lieutenant governor with the allegations we just discussed. The attorney general, who is No. 3 in the line of succession, has said he wore blackface at one time. Don't have any indications that any of these officials would resign. But what if? What if all three of them did have to resign? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Well, we should say, Steve, they're all three Democrats. So this creates challenges for the Democratic Party on a number of levels, one of which is that the No. 4 in line is the House speaker, who is a Republican. His name is Kirk Cox. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : And you may remember that weird election about a year ago, where there was an undecided House race in Virginia that had to be decided by casting lots. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, because they were so close. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Because it was so close. \n\n ###",

And we'll continue listening for your reporting on that mess. Sarah, thanks so much. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : It's been three months since the most destructive and deadliest fire in California history burned almost the entire town of Paradise. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Yeah. The Camp Fire also wiped out 15 percent of housing stock in a county overnight. Now, while some residents have left, others with less means have had no choice but to camp out on their properties. But here's the thing. The federal government says they won't pay for a cleanup if people are living there. You can imagine this is not very popular. The mayor of Paradise, Jody Jones, says there's no choice but to somehow take in federal aid. JODY JONES : If we don't do it, our town will look like a war zone for the next 20 years because we are broke. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Kirk Siegler has been traveling in Paradise. He joins us now. Hi, Kirk. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : Hey, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : What's the town look like? KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : Well, you know, when you heard the mayor there - Mayor Jones saying it's a war zone, that's not an exaggeration. I've been up there for about a month reporting a longer-term project. And every time I drive around the town, it's still just shocking to look at. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : It's rubble. You know, it's billed as a town, but it was really a city of 25,000 people. The Safeway's gone. Whole neighborhoods are gone. Fast-food restaurants are still leveled. And they're still in that state three months on. There just really hasn't been a whole lot of recovery yet. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : And that burned area where people can't live on their burned-out properties was declared a public health disaster for a reason. You can't drink the water, still, in Paradise. The are - benzene's seeping into the water supply. There's other toxins in the ash when the wind blows up. It's - Sarah said mess. It's still a mess in Paradise. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Do you, nevertheless, run into residents from time to time as you move about town? KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : You do. And there was some sort of ruckus - public meetings this week over the proposals to ban camping again for residents, who had been told that they could move back, and now they can't. And this is a big source of tension, as you can imagine, because the town is basically a skeleton. And there was already a housing shortage before the fire, so if people are able to hang on and try to hold out and wait for the recovery, you know, it's not sure where they'll even live. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE : I met Martha Bryant, who was born and raised in Paradise. And, you know, she called this week, you know, yet another setback. And she worries that more people will just give up and leave. MARTHA BRYANT : It's their property. They're adults. They know the risks. We don't need other people - the county and everybody else - telling us how we should live our lives. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Maybe politics is like a game of kickball - everyone wants their friends and the folks with the muscle on their team, except in the world of presidential politics who choose a team by endorsements, pledges of loyalty from business leaders, celebrities and other politicians. Heavy hitters are starting to publicly announce their vote for president. Representative John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights struggle, chose to endorse Senator Hillary Clinton. And last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a former Justice Department official for President Bill Clinton, chose Barack Obama. Now Senator Obama gets even more support from a congressman who's also the son of a civil rights leader. We're talking about Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Chicago. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : In a one-minute radio ad, Jackson recalls 1988, the year when his father won South Carolina's Democratic presidential primary. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Representative JESSE JACKSON JR. (Democrat, Chicago): Once, South Carolina voted for my father and sent a strong message to the nation. Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : With us now, Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. Welcome. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Hello, Farai. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How you doing and how does your father feel about invoking his legacy, running this ad in South Carolina? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Well, Reverend Jackson is a supporter of Barack Obama. He's known Barack most of his life. And Reverend Jackson knows that I served as one of Barack's national chairpersons of his campaign. I'm proud of Barack's effort. He has shown the right judgment needed to lead our country and to rebuild our moral standing in the world. And so I was proud that the senator asked me to participate in this radio advertisement. And I'm fairly confident that the people of South Carolina will hear our message. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now the latest AP poll has African-Americans split down the middle between Obama and Clinton in the presidential race. What is the senator going to do including your ad to really try to reach the African-American voting population? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Well, remember now, the first contest - the early contests are in Iowa; the next contest in New Hampshire where there's a minimal African-American populations. But South Carolina, nearly 40 percent, almost 50 percent of the general election ballot - nearly 40 percent of the general election electorate are African-Americans in South Carolina. South Carolina has a strong and historic opportunity to send a strong message to the rest of the nation about the future of our country. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : How long do you think that Senator Obama has to reach black voters and other voters in the sense that there's going to be a flood of primaries? When do you think is a make-or-break moment for him? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Well, like all other campaigns, the primary dates, the caucus dates are set in stone, and so the senator has roughly 100-day sprint to make the case his message of hope, his message of the new politics to the American people. We are running very strong in Iowa. We've always known that maintaining the kind of super pressed sensitivity to Barack would be very difficult to maintain. It's the holiday season now. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And as the American people begin to focus on this campaign at the turn of the year, at the beginning of the New Year, I'm fairly confident that the American people will look anew and look afresh at Barack Obama. And they won't vote for the politics of the past, they'll vote for the politics of the future. The American people tend to vote, Farai, their hopes not their fears. And so you can't scare people into voting. You have to provide them with the vision and with hope, and I believe the Obama campaign will do just that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now what about the racial politics of running for president in America? You have unprecedented moment where a white woman and African-American man are vying for the top spot in terms of the Democratic field. This ad that you have done is very specific - referring to our community - issues like racial profiling. Will it reach - hit the right spot in the black community and/or will it distance others of other races? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Well, I hope it does hit the right spot. Barack Obama is not speaking as a friend of the community; he is speaking as part of the community - he's one of us. He directly relates to the struggles within the African-American community. You know, when my father ran for president in '84 and '88, it was all for the legacy and a history from 1960 to the time he announced his candidacy in 1984 on speaking to issues of civil rights and social justice for African-Americans primarily, but for all Americans. And so Reverend Jackson started with an African-American base. But the political reality of America, to make America better for everyone, Reverend Jackson acknowledged that he had to build a Rainbow Coalition. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now we have Barack Obama, inheritor of the Rainbow Coalition, a broad base cross-section of Americans who support him who must now do just the opposite of Reverend Jackson's effort. He has a rainbow. He now comes to show up the base, and that's where African-American leaders can measure this candidacy by one standard. Give Barack Obama the opportunity to speak to all Americans about their hopes, about their concerns, about their future, and not limit him to a segment of the population. After all, Barack Obama is not running for mayor of New Orleans, he's not running for mayor of Detroit, he's not running for mayor of Washington, D.C.; he's running for president of the United States, for all Americans. And his candidacy deserves that chance. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Very briefly, do you think that in the time between your father's historic runs in 1994 and 1998 and now America has changed enough to have a black man as president? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Well, I think, very briefly, the question is: Since the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870, are all Americans willing to move in a different direction? And I think it's becoming increasingly clear that they are. In 1776, Hillary Clinton could not be the nominee of our party, neither could Barack Obama. In - 1863, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton could not be the nominee of our party. And for sure as I'm sitting here, one of them will be at the nominee in 2008, and that's because America is constantly becoming a better nation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Congressman, thank you so much. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Rep. JACKSON JR.: Farai, thank you for having me. \n\n ###",

And it was considered, at the time, to be pretty edgy. POLLY CUTTER : (Singing) This is it. This is it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It was created by legendary TV producer Norman Lear. And like his other big hits of the time, it leaned into what many saw as uncomfortable realities. In that case, it was the growing number of single-parent families. Now \"One Day At A Time\" is back. Norman Lear is still executive producer. And the general outline is the same, although now the family is Cuban-American. GLORIA ESTEFAN : (Singing) One day at a time. One day at a time. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : They've got a grandma living with them played exquisitely by Rita Moreno. RITA MORENO : (As Lydia) I came out of the womb wearing stilettos. Even my footie pajamas had kitten heels. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And life is even more complicated. To talk about the third season of the show, which is out today on Netflix, I spoke with one of the stars, Justina Machado. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Your show has gotten so much praise over the last couple of seasons, in particular, for how it has taken on social and political issues. And in the very beginning of the second season, Penelope - your character - Penelope's son Alex comes home from school. He gets in trouble for punching a kid. And he says the reason that he punched the kid was because they were throwing all this racist language his way. JUSTINA MACHADO : (As Penelope) Alex, we're going to figure this out. But you can't hit somebody every time they call you a name. MARCEL RUIZ : (As Alex) I don't. It was just this time. JUSTINA MACHADO : (As Penelope) What? This has happened before? MARCEL RUIZ : (As Alex) Yeah. JUSTINA MACHADO : (As Penelope) What do they say? MARCEL RUIZ : (As Alex) You know, beaner, wet back, gangbanger, Pit Bull. RITA MORENO : (As Lydia) Pit Bull is the only one that's even close to accurate. JUSTINA MACHADO : (As Penelope) Does this happen at school? MARCEL RUIZ : (As Alex) No, just a couple times when I'm out. Once, at a baseball game, the other team was leaving on their bus. And they saw me and yelled, build the wall. ISABELLA GOMEZ : (As Elena) Oh, my God. JUSTINA MACHADO : That clip was - it was heartbreaking. It's always heartbreaking for anybody to go through something like that, especially a young, innocent child. So I really loved that we put that out there. And I love the outcome of it, you know? - like, what she said. They are the ones that have the issue. And we're going to deal with this through communication, with love and not let that change our narrative. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah. I want to talk a little bit about your character Penelope.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We should just say she's a very cool lady. But I think back on a lot of other family sitcoms that I grew up with. And you didn't really see the vulnerability of parents, right? JUSTINA MACHADO : Yeah. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Which is what is so appealing about her - is that, in part, what drew you to her and this role? JUSTINA MACHADO : Well, it's interesting because when I first read for the role, they only gave me a little bit of the script. So I wasn't sure what the whole thing was going to be. But I know that what they gave me was this incredible monologue that was so layered, I thought, if the rest of the show was like this, this is going to be amazing. JUSTINA MACHADO : In reality, I was just drawn to it because it was Norman Lear (laughter). RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. That's a big enough draw. I mean, that's... JUSTINA MACHADO : I was like, Norman Lear? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Whatever. JUSTINA MACHADO : OK, I want in on this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Have you gotten to meet Norman Lear?

So can you talk a little bit about how this fits into the Norman Lear pantheon? Your character in particular - she's not just a divorced, single mom, right? - like Bonnie Franklin was in the original... JUSTINA MACHADO : Right. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : ...\"One Day At A Time.\" She is the daughter of immigrants. And she's a veteran. She's - there's all kinds of layers here. JUSTINA MACHADO : Yeah. And that veteran actually came from Norman because, you know, Norman's a veteran of World War II. So that was important. If anyone knows Norman Lear, they know that he just revolutionized television. He brought all that - you know, the sitcom. He brought topics that were of the day to his shows. \n\n ###",

There have been some reports of nuns having abortions or giving birth to children fathered by priests or bishops. These allegations are not new. Reports about this kind of abuse were given to Vatican officials as far back as the 1990s. Now nuns around the world are speaking out. We have Sister Christine Schenk on the line with us. She's the co-founder of the group FutureChurch, which advocates for more involvement of laypeople in church leadership. Sister Christine, good morning. Thanks for taking the time. CHRISTINE SCHENK : Good morning. And thank you for having me. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Was this a significant acknowledgment by the pope? CHRISTINE SCHENK : I think it was. Historically, the hierarchical church tries to keep all of this quiet. But Francis is not one to be that way. He's been out of the box on internal, structural sin from the very beginning. And so I really welcomed his statement because any time you bring stuff that's shrouded in secrecy into the light, it's a step in the right direction. DAVID GREENE, HOST : I wonder when you first learned about this happening within the church. CHRISTINE SCHENK : Actually, I was around in the 1990s when all of the women from Africa began reporting just horrific abuses. And at the time, we tried very hard to get more information and to do an advocacy thing on their behalf but because of the power dynamics, were very fearful of, you know, becoming more public and would not engage at that time. So, you know, we left it to the internal structures to work it out of their own religious orders. I was happy to learn that things had improved quite a bit in Africa. CHRISTINE SCHENK : But they've improved mainly because the religious orders themselves have taken very big steps to educate their young sisters and to avoid being alone with clerics, to stop asking for letters of recommendation to enter religious orders from clerics, to stop clerics being spiritual directors. And so the incidents have gotten better. But it hasn't been because of the hierarchy. It's been because the sister leadership has taken care to protect their young sisters. DAVID GREENE, HOST : Are they going to do something? Like, are you confident that the pope is going to do something that would really make a difference here? CHRISTINE SCHENK : I think he's going to try. But until the church develops some kinds of structure of accountability for removing bishops who abuse sisters but who also abuse children, I'm afraid not a whole lot will happen. I mean, and so my whole... DAVID GREENE, HOST : This just goes on. And no one even realizes it. CHRISTINE SCHENK : Right, they don't. They don't think it's a big problem. And it's because people don't speak out because of - fearing retaliation. In some countries, the church is a persecuted minority. And they don't want to make it look bad in the larger public. I mean, there's a lot of complexity about the issue. My hope is the February 21 meeting, even though I don't expect a lot in the way of bishop accountability, could well be a consciousness-raising moment for the bishops - the Catholic bishops of the world, especially in the... DAVID GREENE, HOST : This is the pope meeting with bishops and priests in a couple of weeks to... CHRISTINE SCHENK : Yeah. DAVID GREENE, HOST : ...Actually address the issue of sex abuse around the globe. So this, in theory, would be a place where this would... CHRISTINE SCHENK : Right. DAVID GREENE, HOST : ...Come up if the pope was going to do something. CHRISTINE SCHENK : Exactly. And so in some ways, I'm really glad a lot of this is breaking now because it puts it on the table, as well as the horrific issues of child sex abuse. DAVID GREENE, HOST : I just want to ask you. Is getting more laypeople in church leadership, as your group advocates - is that - could that make a difference here? CHRISTINE SCHENK : I think it would make a huge difference. And we've said for years if we had parents at the decision-making table, these, you know, abusive priests would've been out of there immediately. And so I think we - unfortunately, we're not close enough. But real, systemic change won't happen until we have all of the voices in the church at the decision-making table.

In the State of the Union speech, President Trump faces an illustration of the difference between being a business executive and a president. He faces lawmakers who were elected on their own who constitute a coequal branch of government and aren't going anywhere. The very date of the speech is a demonstration. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will sit behind the president during the speech, delayed this event until the president ended a partial government shutdown. So what's the president have to say now? NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here. Good morning. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So what are you hearing at the White House about what the president plans to say? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : So this president is known for breaking traditions, but the White House is stressing that this State of the Union will be pretty traditional. Trump is going to deliver a unifying message, according to officials. And here's how Trump framed the speech when he was asked about this last week. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people 'cause they've been incredible. We have had some incredible rapport, and we've had incredible Republican support. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Who's he referring to there, Ayesha, when he talks about the people you see right here, working with these people? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : So I think those were just some government officials that he was talking to - kind of his administration. But I've been... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Business group as well, I suppose. He's talking... AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Yeah, business group. Yeah, business group. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : All right. Go on, go on. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Yeah. And so there's going to be talking - talk of bridging old divisions and healing wounds. And this is supposed to be Trump kind of at his most optimistic. There will be a pitch for border security, and he will almost certainly advocate for a wall. But the White House is pointing to these areas where they think there can be agreement - infrastructure once again... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : ...And also lowering health care costs. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, we'll see what happens there. Now, you mentioned the wall discussions. Some of the lawmakers, who we expect would be in the room tonight, are lawmakers who've been working on some kind of border security compromise. Republicans and Democrats have hinted or explicitly said that among themselves they could more or less agree on this, but the president doesn't expect them to give any money or enough money to satisfy him on his wall. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : And that's the whole issue. And the White House acknowledges that there are some real differences on a border security policy between the president and Democrats. And so you - and you also have this threat of President Trump declaring a national emergency that he's been hanging out. It's not expected that he would do that at the State of the Union, but the fact that he has this kind of in his back pocket and that he's been kind of teasing that he might do this will probably maybe undercut some of the ideas of unification that he's going to put forward tomorrow night because it's such a polarizing idea. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : It is a polarizing idea among Republicans. You can look at a quote from Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who's saying, the president should bypass Congress, bypass my own institution and declare a state of emergency. But you can also hear John Cornyn who is a Republican. And nobody would say he's not partisan, but he's saying, listen, there's a constitution; there's a Senate; there's a system, and it would be a bad idea to go for a state of emergency. It's not clear that Republicans are unified behind that idea. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : And they're not. They're not necessarily unified. And that's part of the issue - is that if he goes ahead with this, he may have some pushback from his own party. And so that's what he's going to have to figure out going forward. Is he willing to take that risk? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Ayesha, thanks very much as always. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. \n\n ###",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Or the People's House, as some lawmakers like to call it. The speaker of the House will convene the speech that she delayed during the partial government shutdown. President Trump is still demanding a border wall, the demand that drove that shutdown. And he addresses lawmakers with border security still unresolved and a deadline looming. Some of the lawmakers, who will be in the room tonight, are working on compromise. But the president has said he doubts that will work, and he's been talking of bypassing Congress by declaring a state of emergency. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is with us this morning. Hey, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The White House typically gives a readout on what to expect from the State of the Union, themes they're going to focus on. What are you hearing? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : So while this president is known for breaking traditions, the White House is stressing that this State of the Union will be pretty traditional. Trump is going to deliver a unifying message according to officials. Here's how Trump framed the speech when he was asked about this last week. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I think it's unification. I think it's industry. I think it's about the people that you see right here. It's also working with these people 'cause they've been incredible. We have had some incredible report, and we've had incredible Republican support. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Presumably, Ayesha, he was with some business leaders or something when he gave these remarks. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Yes - yeah, giving these remarks. And so there's going to be talk of kind of bridging old divisions and healing wounds. And this is supposed to be Trump at his most optimistic and kind of presenting his vision for the future. But there will be a pitch for border security, and he's expected to advocate for a wall. But the White House says there are areas where they believe that Trump will be able to find some common ground with Democrats - for instance, spending on rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. And then there's Trump's push to lower health care costs and prescriptions. And they hope that's an area where there might be some compromise. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We should just note we've been hearing about infrastructure and its bipartisan possibilities for at least two years. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Is this infrastructure week again this week? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : It's infrastructure week always, yes. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Always. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : As Steve mentioned, the president has made no secret about exploring the possibility of declaring a state of emergency to get the border wall funding. Any idea whether or not he's going to use the speech to again threaten that? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : The president has said stay tuned when it comes to this idea of declaring a national emergency. But the thought is that it's unlikely that he will do it tonight. Anything is possible, but that would likely overshadow this idea of unification... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right (laughter). AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : ...If you throw out such a polarizing idea. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : And - but what officials have said that Trump will try to do is point to areas where there has been agreement and compromise over the past two years. For instance, when it came to changing drug sentencing laws and promoting job training jobs - or job training programs to prisoners in this bill called the FIRST STEP Act, that was a bipartisan bill that - or law that passed last year. And you're going to have some of the beneficiaries of that bill... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In the audience, yeah. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : ...Of that new law in the audience at the State of the Union. \n\n ###",

But we should note, this president periodically has called for unity going all the way back to his primary campaign. From time to time, he's called for unity. But like many a politician, when he calls for unity, he typically ends up saying something like, everyone unify behind my position; come on. And so it's a hard thing to do. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. The Democrats get a chance to weigh in. What do we know about the Democratic response after the speech, Ayesha? AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who ran for governor of Georgia last year, will be giving the response. She didn't win that election, but she's viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe with a preview of the speech - thanks, Ayesha. AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right. We're going to pivot and talk about what is happening in the state of Virginia. And what is happening in the state of Virginia is a whole lot of political uncertainty. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. Days ago, the discovery of an old racist photo in a yearbook of Governor Ralph Northam prompted people to ask - who's next in line to be governor? Well, it's Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor. But now people are checking just to be sure about who is third in line because Fairfax faces accusations of his own. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We are joined on the line from Richmond, Va., by Mallory Noe-Payne of member station WVTF. Mallory, thanks for being here. MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Explain the allegation against the lieutenant governor. MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : So a conservative blog, the same one that actually first published the photo of Northam, published an allegation of sexual assault against the lieutenant governor. So... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is from a few years back. Right? MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : It is. It's from before he was married. He was in his mid-20s. The accuser hasn't spoken publicly, so there's really not much that we know except for that he came out denying the allegation. He presides over the state Senate, so he was working as usual yesterday. And he stepped out of the Senate; reporters just surrounded him and gave him the chance to respond. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I think we've actually got tape of that. Let's listen to him. JUSTIN FAIRFAX : Does anybody think it's any coincidence that on the eve of, potentially, my being elevated that that's when this uncorroborated smear comes out? Does anybody believe that's a coincidence? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So it sounds like he's blaming fellow Democrats here. MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : Well - so he's either blaming fellow Democrats, or he's blaming the conservative blog that chose to run this information now. The Washington Post actually said that this accuser approached them with a story about a year ago. They chose not to run the story because it was a \"he said, she said\" situation. They couldn't corroborate it in any way. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We should clarify. He intimated further in that clip that it could be supporters of Governor Northam himself who don't like the idea of Fairfax taking over. Have we heard anything more from Governor Northam at this point? MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : No. Governor Northam's spokeswoman did come out and say that it was a hundred percent not true that these accusations somehow come back to Northam or his people at all. But it's been more than 36 hours since Northam's last public appearance or public statement of any kind. So we don't know what the governor is thinking at this point. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So let's just play this out. Let us imagine a scenario where Northam - the pressure on him to resign is just too much. He feels he can't govern, so he leaves. And Fairfax - let's play this out... \n\n ###",

He actually had already announced plans to run for governor in 2020, so he planned - or hoped, at least - to follow Northam. So who knows? He may get that job sooner than expected - not out of the realm of possibility. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh. So he's thinking of running in 2021, but now he has to be prepared. Who knows? Who knows? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right, lots of unanswered questions at this point. Mallory Noe-Payne from member station WVTF in Richmond. Mallory, thank you so much. MALLORY NOE-PAYNE, BYLINE : You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The clock is ticking on a 1987 arms control agreement that symbolized the end of the Cold War. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : It's called the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and the Trump administration announced last week that the United States is dropping out. It's set to expire in the next six months. Now, in his announcement the other day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has spent the past six years trying to get the Russians to follow the treaty. MIKE POMPEO : We have raised Russia's noncompliance with Russian officials, including at the highest levels of government, more than 30 times. Yet Russia continues to deny that its missile system is noncompliant and violates the treaty. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So how is Russia responding? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Let's ask NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow. Good morning, Lucian. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So we're clear on the U.S. position. But what has President Putin said about this? LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE : Well, President Putin says the U.S. was never interested in saving the INF Treaty and is using Russian noncompliance, which of course the Kremlin denies, as a pretext to end it. Putin said over the weekend that Russia's response will be symmetrical. That means Russia will also suspend its participation in the treaty and will reserve the right to develop weapons banned under it. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE : I think what's interesting here is that Putin made sure to emphasize that these new weapons won't require any extra spending. This is a very sensitive subject right now in Russia. It seems like Russians, right now, are more interested in butter than they are in guns. And Putin, of course, remembers very well that the Soviet Union basically went bankrupt trying to keep up with the U.S. arms spending during the Cold War. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So they insist that they're complying with this deal. I mean, do they have any evidence that they are? LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE : Russia insists that they are complying. A couple of weeks ago, they even presented the launch tube and launch vehicle of the missile in question. But American officials have dismissed this as a public relations stunt. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : But you say that this will now allow Russia to expand their missile program, essentially, to be able to produce the kinds of weapons that were banned under the INF, which raises the question - is this the best way to contain Russia's ambitions, just allowing them to move forward? LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE : Yeah, that's right. I mean, the weapons banned under the INF Treaty are intermediate range, so that means U.S. missiles based in Europe and Russian missiles aimed at Europe. For the moment, NATO has said it's not interested in basing these kind of American missiles in Europe. And Russia says, for now, he won't deploy any new weapons until the U.S. does. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK. So if we look forward here - if this treaty expires as it looks like that will be the outcome, there is only one major nuclear weapons treaty that will still bind the U.S. and Russia. This is the New START Treaty, which basically limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads. That is set to expire in two years. What's the health of that agreement right now? \n\n ###",

STACEY ABRAMS : Growing up, my family went back and forth between lower middle class and working class. Yet even when they came home weary and bone-tired, my parents found a way to show us all who we could be. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Let's talk about the tradition of the official response with commentator Cokie Roberts, who joins us each week to talk about how the government and politics work. Hi, Cokie. COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : Hi, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK, here's a question from one of our listeners. CHRISTINA GRIFFITH : Hi, this is Christina Griffith (ph). I live in Philadelphia. When was the first time Congress decided a response to the State of the Union was necessary? And was the choice of who would make that response always a meaningful gesture? Or did it just fall to party leadership? COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : Well, the first response, in the way we've come to know it, came in 1966. The year before, Lyndon Johnson had moved the State of the Union from a daytime event into prime time for a bigger audience. And the Republicans realized what a boon it was, and so they demanded some time for a response. The two congressional leaders, Gerald Ford and Everett Dirksen, delivered it. And, yes, it is the leaders who decide, but they've decided all kinds of different approaches over the years. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Now, we have a question from Robert Lee Rouse Jr. (ph), who asks, don't these speeches kind of have a history of burning the person who gives them? COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : (Laughter) Well, the person who gives them often burns him or herself. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : Do you remember in 2013 Marco Rubio grabbing for a bottle of water? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : He remembers - that's for sure. COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : He does. In 2009, then Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal sounded so much like Mister Rogers that he was ridiculed endlessly by late-night comedians. My personal favorite was 1985 when the Democrats put on a slick video where they conducted focus groups to answer Ronald Reagan. The voters spoke their minds. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON : And we said that Reagan's program wouldn't work. And to the extent that individuals are better off, it has worked - at the price obviously of the deficit. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wait a minute. That's the Democratic response? COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : (Laughter) Yeah, that was the Democratic response - not exactly scathing criticisms of the president. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was the anchorman of that broadcast. And though it was weird, it didn't seem to hurt him. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Dalsey Brand (ph) writes with the opposite question. Has any of these speeches ever been a big success? COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : Well, the whole setup is basically unfair. The president's in the historic hall of the House of Representatives. The responder's usually a guy standing alone in a room in front of a teleprompter. In 1995, the Republicans got away from that in their response to Clinton. CHRISTINE WHITMAN : I'm Christine Whitman, governor of New Jersey. And I am addressing you tonight from the historic legislative chamber in Trenton - one of the oldest in the nation. COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE : That one scored on several fronts. It was out of Washington in a stately setting, with people there actually applauding - and Republicans putting forward a woman, which often works for them. \n\n ###",

And for now, among the less-influential, a freshman in a house where seniority counts. Her status is reflected in her new office, down a distant corridor of an office building on Capitol Hill. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : I picked the office that was arguably the furthest walk from the Capitol. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Which allowed her staff a bit more space. So you're, like, effectively living in the suburbs to get a bigger house? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Exactly. That's exactly the choice I made. (Laughter). STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : We met Ocasio-Cortez inside that office. Sunlight fell through the oversized window onto her fuchsia suit. Her office is still a fraction of the size of the committee chairmen who hold real power in Congress, though she has something they do not. The 29-year-old is a media star. She has been since she upset a leading Democrat in a New York City primary last year. Her surprise victory cast her as a party insurgent. Her label as a Democratic Socialist also alarmed conservatives, who now see her face constantly on Fox News. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Today, she tries to leverage her fame. She joins dozens of other lawmakers proposing an environmental and economic plan, called the Green New Deal. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country and to the world. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : You can find the Green New Deal resolution on our website today. NPR is the first to publish this call to transform the economy. It's a resolution calling for massive increases in renewable energy production, like wind and solar. It would have the United States set a goal to become carbon neutral in 10 years, which is a very ambitious timeline. This resolution says what should be done but offers few specifics on how to do it. That would have to come in later legislation. Instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Why, in this resolution, do you make a point of saying the United States bears disproportionate responsibility for the problem? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Because I think we do. And if we want the United States to continue to be a global leader then that means we have to lead on the solution of this issue. And I think that it is completely wrong to point fingers at other developing nations and to say, well, China's doing this and India's doing that and Russia is doing this, when we can just choose to lead and we don't have to hold ourselves to a lower bar. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : You're talking about things that obviously would cost a lot of money. I know you'd rather think of it as an investment rather than a cost, but it is just certainly a lot of money. You don't specify where it's going to come from, other than saying it will all pay for itself. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Yeah. I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. It's just not how government expenditure works. We can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the GOP tax cut, which I think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, I get that. But deficit spending is borrowing money that has to be paid back eventually through taxes. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Yeah. And I think it - I think that is always the crux of it. So when we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly. We ask, is this an investment or is this actually going to pay for itself? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So you're saying borrow the money, make the investment. The economy will grow. It will pay off the debt. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Absolutely. Because we're creating jobs. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Although, I do have to say, you mentioned the Republican tax cut. They said the same thing about the tax cut - let's do this tax cut. The economy will grow. It's going to be great. It's going to pay for itself. Hasn't turned out to be true at all. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : Absolutely. And I think that that is an important distinction to make because when they were advancing that cause, they had no evidence to say that these things were going to happen. But we actually do have the evidence. For every $1 invested in infrastructure, we get $6 back. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : As you know, Congresswoman, one reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don't like. Are you prepared to put on the table that, yes, actually, they're right, what this requires is massive government intervention? ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ : It does. It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that. Why? Because we have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. They said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. Except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet. \n\n ###",

Thief River Falls, Minn., recorded -77 Fahrenheit one night. But how can you measure the costs of extreme weather? Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from Planet Money's The Indicator podcast tell us what happens to the economy when it rains or hails or gets really cold outside. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and New Hampshire all saw temperatures in the negative double digits last week. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : The culprit - the infamous polar vortex. Basically, a weather system that is usually above the North Pole came here to visit us in the U.S. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : Andreas Prein is a research scientist at the Center for Atmospheric Research. He studies extreme weather for a living. And he looks at the different impacts that the weather can have. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : What is the economic effect of extreme weather? ANDREAS PREIN : It's really big. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : He says climate change is causing more intense, big storms, like hurricanes. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And these storms are more expensive than they used to be both because they're more intense and also because there are more people moving to areas that are affected by extreme weather - places like New York and Florida. ANDREAS PREIN : The biggest economic effect in the U.S. is coming from hurricanes. So, for example, if you talk to insurance industry, they're most concerned about Atlantic hurricanes when they hit the East Coast. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : Andreas says that 17 of the 20 most expensive and damaging cyclones that we've had have occurred in the last 20 years. He says that Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey and Maria all caused between roughly $70 billion and $125 billion each in damages. That was in destroyed property, flood damage, businesses being suspended or even permanently closed in some cases. He says hurricanes have emerged as the most economically destructive form of extreme weather in the U.S. ANDREAS PREIN : The second is really heatwaves and droughts. And, of course, it's also the deadliest of natural disasters, I have to say. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Andreas says the drought cost nearly $3 billion in lost employment on farms, insurance claims and lost agricultural productivity. The next one on the list... ANDREAS PREIN : Floods, I would say. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : He says extreme rainfall in the Northeast has increased by about 70 percent in the last 70 years. Also, Andreas says, commercial insurance generally does not cover flooding. So those costs can fall to homeowners and business owners. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Which brings us to the fourth most economically damaging extreme weather event. ANDREAS PREIN : I would say severe convective storms. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Convective - like with a V. ANDREAS PREIN : With a V, yeah. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Convective, OK. ANDREAS PREIN : The interesting thing about severe convective storms is that they can cause tornado or large hail or very strong winds. \n\n ###",

The United States confrontation with Iran is the latest chapter in a 40-year-old story - 40 years old this year. February is the anniversary of the 1979 revolution when an Islamist, anti-American government took power. But, really, the story is even older than that because that anti-Americanism in Iran goes back to an event in 1953, which we're about to discuss with the hosts of NPR's new history podcast. It's called Throughline. And the hosts are Ramtin Arablouei - welcome. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And Rund Abdelfatah, good morning to you. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Thanks, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. So what was happening in Iran in 1953? RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Well, up until 1953, the U.S. and Iran didn't have much of a relationship. But then there was the issue of oil, specifically Great Britain's interest in Iran in terms of oil. Steve, for a very long time, for decades, Great Britain controlled most of Iran's oil resources. British Petroleum - BP - they were originally called the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wow. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : And the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had a deal with the Iranian government around oil that really favored British interests. Iran didn't take much money away from the oil revenues. Anyway, there was an Iranian politician named Mohammed Mossadegh, who had been railing against this deal for a very long time. Eventually, he was able to convince the Iranian parliament to nationalize their oil industry. And then he became prime minister. And then he shut down the British embassy because he was afraid that they were going to use the embassy to stage some kind of... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Sure. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : ...Coup against his government. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : The British lost their foothold there. And so they saw it as a real threat. They sought help from their closest ally. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Their big brother, their big friend... RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Yeah. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : ...Across the Atlantic - the United States. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Yeah, the United States. Right. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : What did the Americans do?

So he took us through it step by step. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Step one... STEPHEN KINZER : Seize control of the Iranian press. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Basically, buy them off with bribes. STEPHEN KINZER : Turned out that the press was quite corrupt. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Step two - recruit allies on the ground - most importantly, the Islamic clergy or mullahs. STEPHEN KINZER : Kermit Roosevelt made strategic payments to a number of important mullahs in exchange for them delivering sermons denouncing Mossadegh from the pulpit as against God and irreligious. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Step three - get Iran's king, the shah, onboard. Roosevelt took matters into his own hands and began meeting with the shah almost every day - at midnight, in a taxicab - always in a different location. Roosevelt managed to convince the shah that Mossadegh was a threat. And so the shah agreed to the coup. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : And finally, step four - go to Mossadegh's house in the middle of the night, arrest him and put a puppet ruler in his place. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : But this whole first attempt fails. Roosevelt's bosses back in Washington tell him he can come home. Instead, Roosevelt doubles down and decides to try again - this time, taking it to a whole new level. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Attention is focused once again on the Middle East, where events in Iran have taken a dramatic double twist. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : On August 19, it began. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Roosevelt set out to make the Mossadegh government look like it was losing control of the country. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Three-hundred killed and hundreds wounded is a conservative estimate. \n\n ###",

First of all, hire gangs of Iranians through people who controlled criminal protection rackets. And pay them to go out on the street and cause chaos. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : So Roosevelt actually paid criminals and gang members to storm into the city. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Beat up people in the streets. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Break shop windows. STEPHEN KINZER : Shoot your guns into mosques. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : And then... STEPHEN KINZER : He hired a second mob to attack the first mob. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : Which led to bloody, violent clashes between the two mobs. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : And the really trippy thing was that everybody involved... STEPHEN KINZER : Everybody involved in the battles was being paid to be there. But what they didn't know was they were being paid by the same source. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : The CIA - and it worked. Mossadegh looked weak. STEPHEN KINZER : Mossadegh refused to send the police out because he said, well, they're peaceful demonstrators. People should be allowed to say what they want. He truly was too naive to grasp what was happening. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : And this brings us to the final part of Roosevelt's plan - to get rid of Mossadegh once and for all. Roosevelt ordered both mobs to head to Mossadegh's house. STEPHEN KINZER : Then who should show up but several police and military commanders, including a couple with tanks, people who Kermit Roosevelt had bribed to participate. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : Those officers began opening fire on Mossadegh's house, while inside, Mossadegh and a few of his closest advisers huddled together. STEPHEN KINZER : Tells them, I want to die here in the house. STEPHEN KINZER : But somehow, they managed to drag him out a back window. They got him over a fence. He fled. The house was looted. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : And one of Roosevelt's paid generals goes on the radio and announces that the shah is returning to power. RUND ABDELFATAH, BYLINE : UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Foreign language spoken). RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE : And just like that, with a couple of chess moves, Kermit Roosevelt's plan ushered Iran into a new era. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Northam said, if he finds that he can't govern as a result of this controversy, he will have to reassess. The governor has had several dramatic days. He was criticized for remarks about abortion then engulfed by the story of a racist photo under his name in a medical school yearbook. First, Northam apologized. But then, he said the photo wasn't him. Former allies say it's basically just too late. The previous governor, Terry McAuliffe, spoke yesterday to NPR's Michel Martin. TERRY MCAULIFFE : This is now about Virginia, who we are as Virginians and most importantly - how do we move forward? And he's just put himself in a position that he no longer can have that moral authority, nor can he lead the legislature and - to move our state forward. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So can he govern? McAuliffe's answer is no. Northam, of course, gets to decide for now. NPR's Sarah McCammon has been covering this story. She's in Richmond, Va. Sarah, good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : You were at this press conference Saturday where the governor was thought to be planning to resign, then he said he would not. How did he explain himself? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Right, Steve. It was a - I have to say, it was like a press conference I've never seen before, and I've been to a lot of political press conferences. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : There was speculation throughout the day about whether he might resign, but word came a little bit beforehand that he didn't plan to. And he walked back his initial story. I mean, within 24 hours or so of saying, yes, I was in this photo, and I'm sorry for it, he said, I actually don't believe I was in the photo. On further reflection, after conversations with family and classmates, I don't think that was me. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : But then, Steve, he said - and I remember this; I know I would remember this - because he said he remembers another incident with regret in which he appeared in blackface for a Michael Jackson costume. This was around the same time. He said he was at a dance competition. And he said he remembers that with regret, so he's sure that he's not in the photo. And he doesn't plan to resign. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : But so many questions, Sarah. OK. So it's conceivable it's not him in the photo. It's somebody in blackface. It's somebody in a Klan outfit, could be anybody there - except there was a moment when he seemed to remember it was him and admitted it. Did he explain that moment of admitting it? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Well, he said he felt a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility to respond quickly when this news first emerged on Friday. It emerged on a blog, and it was quickly confirmed by a lot of media, including NPR. And he said there was just so much hurt and shock surrounding it. He said he felt shock as well, but he felt he had to take responsibility and apologize. And he said, I was presented with the evidence. It was my yearbook page, for sure. I thought it must be me. And it was even really unclear during the press conference what his state of mind was at that time. But he did indeed apologize for it and take responsibility initially. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And we'll note that in his second version of the story, he says he'd never seen that yearbook photo in all the years since 1984. Now he says he'll stay unless he finds he can't govern, then he has to reassess. What are the factors that determine if he can govern? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Well, he's lost the support of pretty much everyone that matters in the Democratic Party, both here in Virginia and nationally. And remember, Steve, Richmond is the capital of Virginia, and there is business to get done here, not just politics. This is a really big week in the legislature, a lot of key deadlines right now. And Democrats are concerned about how to, you know, advance their agenda. They made a lot of gains in 2017. This is an election year for the Virginia legislature. They hope - Democrats hope to make more gains. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : And of course, heading into 2020, this doesn't look good for Democrats here or for the party. So there's a lot of concern both about how Northam can govern and what it says about Democrats here and nationally that he remains in office. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Very briefly - I guess you've been talking with voters also, right? SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : I've been talking with voters, and I hear really the same concerns. That - I've heard a lot of people who supported him say, I can forgive him as a person, but he just is not in a position to continue being a leader here. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Sarah, thanks so much. Really appreciate it. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE : Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. \n\n ###",

After an 11-week trial, jury deliberations begin today for one of the world's most notorious drug traffickers. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : His name is Joaquin Guzman. He is known widely as El Chapo, and he is the leader of the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel. Guzman faces 10 charges, including leading a criminal enterprise and importing and selling large amounts of narcotics here in the U.S. If the jury convicts him, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Quil Lawrence watched the closing arguments of this trial, and he's on the line. Quil, good morning. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : How straightforward is this case? QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : Well, I mean, if you just took all of the evidence that the prosecution presented and put it on a scale next to what the defense presented, it's pretty lopsided. The prosecution had 37 days' worth of witnesses. They had a dozen boxes of evidence that they brought into the courtroom last week during closing arguments, including AK-47s and cans of La Comadre chilies, these cans that Chapo Guzman allegedly used in a canning factory that he would fill with cocaine and ship to the U.S. The defense called just one witness and lasted 30 minutes. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wow. This is fascinating, first because, you know, cans full of chilies. So they're being shipped through legal border crossings to the United States, and they get here. Second, when you're - you're telling me that if his guilt or innocence were judged by weight, I mean, that statue of blind justice would fall over on one side because the prosecution gave so much evidence. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : Right, yeah. And I mean, it was - you talk about the cans being shipped in the United States. The ingenuity that was presented over 11 weeks of testimony of creating this multibillion-dollar, multinational corporation, allegedly, using trains and tunnels and ships and planes and submarines full of cocaine and cash - there were wiretaps. So El Chapo was allegedly obsessed with security, and he would tape all these calls. He even had an IT specialist set up a special network for him. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wow. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : Unfortunately, that IT specialist turned state witness. And so the jury heard all of these tapes in the courtroom. And the prosecutor was able to say, well, you heard it from this cooperating witness. You also heard El Chapo, in his own words, say, you know, I'm sending 20 kilos of heroin to you in Chicago, etc. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wow. OK, so sounds pretty bad. We should note, also, there doesn't seem to be any doubt that El Chapo is or was a drug lord. He was a celebrity in Mexico. Many of these things were virtually happening in the open. And yet, when you go into court, there is the question - did the prosecution actually charge the specific violations of law beyond a reasonable doubt? So what is the defense here for El Chapo? QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : Right. I mean, this guy is notorious. And he's on Netflix already, so the jury is supposed to have a blank slate. But he's already sort of infamous for having escaped prisons in Mexico. And the defense attorney really just spent his closing arguments maligning the character of all the cooperating witnesses, which was not hard to do. Some of them are credited with over a hundred murders. But he never really said that El Chapo Guzman is innocent, and he barely really tried to humanize him. It was an elaborate explanation that he isn't the head of the Sinaloa Cartel, that's someone else - Mayo Zambada. But again, it seemed rather lopsided. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Well, we will wait for your reporting on the verdict. Quil, thanks so much. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE : OK. Thanks, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Quil Lawrence. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And now let's talk about the United Arab Emirates, where Pope Francis is visiting. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Not just visiting, making history because it's the first time ever that a pontiff has visited the Arabian Peninsula, which is the birthplace of Islam. It is also, though - the UAE, in particular - home to a million Catholics. Many of them are migrant workers from other countries. The pope is going to use his trip to talk about the need for more interfaith dialogue. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is traveling with the pope and joins us now from Abu Dhabi in the UAE. Hi, Sylvia SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE : Hi, Steve.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro insists he's not going anywhere. He remains in place even though European nations have recognized an opposition leader as president and protesters flooded the streets over the weekend. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS : (Chanting) Si, se puede. Si, se puede. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Si, se puede, they're saying - \"yes, it's possible\" or \"yes, we can.\" But Maduro supporters were marching, too, marking the 20th anniversary of Venezuela's socialist government. That government's rise to power is the backdrop for this moment. It came to power with a 1999 election of Maduro's populist predecessor Hugo Chavez. A specialist on Latin America, Miguel Tinker Salas of Pomona College, followed Chavez's career. MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : For the first time, you had a leader in Venezuela that looked like the mixed-race population, that spoke like them, acted like them. And he was able to utilize much of that to, again, promote social programs and to be re-elected on multiple occasions. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So this populist guy, Hugo Chavez, tries a coup, fails - but ends up winning an election, taking power - huge media figure, on television all the time, dominating everybody's lives and says he's going to change everything. How did he change things in the last years of his life? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : The first was political reform, the constitution of 1999, which is today being promoted by the opposition, which at that time they opposed. Then there was a coup in 2002. He came back. And then we had dramatic investment in social programs - health care, education, housing. But that could only happen as long as oil prices were exceedingly high. And eventually, as prices declined, there would be a reckoning. And that reckoning has happened. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : At what point did it become apparent that, amid all of this spending, that the oil money was starting to run out. MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : As the prices after 2014, 2015 begin to decline, Chavez has died. You begin to have shortages of basic food products, long lines. You have the U.S. sanctions, mismanagement, corruption. There are several factors. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And I guess it was in this period that Chavez's party began losing elections, that his successor, Nicolas Maduro, his party tried to keep control of the legislature and totally lost. Right? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : Correct. It's the very first electoral victory the opposition scores in the National Assembly. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So they won the legislative elections, but then Maduro's government completely disempowered the legislature. Right? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : Right. Maduro increasingly relies on what he will call the National Constituent Assembly (ph), which is this clause in the constitution which he activated to create a alternative body. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So wait a minute. Maduro is clearly losing power from 2015 onward. And instead of just fighting it out in elections, he ends up taking all the power away from the National Assembly, winning re-election with deeply disputed methods. How much popularity, though, does the president still seem to have, if any? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : According to some polls - even opposition polls - anywhere from 25 to 30 percent, even with the current crisis. And the opposition to Maduro is not just from the right. There are people protesting against Maduro that are protesting because he has not fulfilled the promises he made to the popular sectors. The opposition, they are united in ousting Maduro. It's not clear that they are united on what comes next. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : The opposition leader Juan Guaido has said he's president under this provision that says that the legislative leader becomes interim president if there's a vacancy of the presidency. But isn't he limited to holding that office for 30 days until he can figure out an election? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : Yes. And this is where it becomes kind of problematic because the constitution says 30 days. I'm hearing already from opposition sources saying that maybe they need a year to cleanse the political process. That would lead to more chaos. And that's the fear of playing to the military. What happens if you do find a faction in the military and we do wind up with an open military conflict? The consequences would be disastrous for the country. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Is the opposition movement discredited at all because it has such overt support from the United States? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : For an important segment of Venezuelan society, it is. The fact that you have Donald Trump, whose actions in terms of Latin America vis-a-vis the border, immigrant families, the separation of children. And then you have John Bolton and statements about the oil company. That baggage is part of what Guaido now carries. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Even with that said, does it seem to you that the opposition is legitimate on some level, that they represent the broad majority of society? MIGUEL TINKER SALAS : I think the opposition is a legitimate force in Venezuela. I think that they not always have been Democratic. We have to go back, understand that in 2002, they supported a coup. The reality is that unless there is a negotiated solution, unless the parties can come together, it puts us back at square one tomorrow. \n\n ###",

On Sunday, more than 20 people were killed in a church bombing, and a grenade attack on a mosque left two people dead on Wednesday. These attacks came after voters in the southern part of the country approved a new autonomy plan that was aimed at ending decades of conflict between Muslim separatists and the central government. This is a conflict that has left more than 100,000 people dead. Michael Sullivan reports from Manila. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : The 2017 siege of the city of Marawi by ISIS-linked extremists; the kidnappings, beheadings and bombings by the notorious Abu Sayyaf terror group - these are the things that have grabbed the media spotlight. The new Bangsamoro autonomy plan - not so much. ZACHARY ABUZA : This is the first chance we have for lasting peace in Mindanao. I think people really want to give this a chance. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : That's Zachary Abuza, author of \"Forging Peace In Southeast Asia: Insurgencies, Peace Processes, And Reconciliation.\" Peace in this case has been a long time coming. STEVEN ROOD : Over the last 45 years, there have been numerous attempts to give or negotiate more autonomy, none of which have been actually fulfilled. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : Steven Rood is a fellow at the research firm Social Weather Stations in Manila. He also says that this time feels different, after the government passed the law in July and after voters in largely Muslim Mindanao did the same just days before Sunday's church bombing. STEVEN ROOD : Some 85 percent of the people voted in favor of having this new law, which has the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, at least for a three-year transition, running this new autonomous region. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : The mainstream separatist MILF had been fighting the government for over 30 years. But it settled for a deal that gives the region greater autonomy and more control over its rich natural resources. GLENDA GLORIA : It also puts them in charge of the peace and order situation in the region. It gives them a very powerful responsibility - as well as resources - to make sure that peace happens in Mindanao. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : That's a tall order, says Glenda Gloria, managing editor of the online news service Rappler and the co-author of \"Under The Crescent Moon: Rebellion In Mindanao,\" a region that's long suffered from economic and political neglect, one ripe for exploitation by ISIS-linked extremists. GLENDA GLORIA : You have to remember that the out-of-school youth rate in Muslim Mindanao is bigger than the national average. So there are a lot of unschooled young people who are vulnerable to recruitment by ISIS. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : And then there's Marawi. In May 2017, ISIS-linked militants and foreign fighters occupied and held parts of the Muslim-majority city for five months before being driven out or killed by the Philippine military. The city was left in ruins; 15 months later, it still is. Rommel Banlaoi is the chair of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research. ROMMEL BANLAOI : The longer you delay the rebuilding of Marawi, the more opportunities for the Islamic State to recruit and replenish their members. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : Some analysts say Sunday's church bombing was meant to disrupt the peace process. But Samira Gutoc, a Marawi native who helped draft the new law, isn't worried. SAMIRA GUTOC : There's always a sporadic incident of bombing grenade that would happen when a landmark event happens in Bangsamoro. And the landmark event right now is the Bangsamoro Organic Law \"yes\" vote. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : Scare tactics, she says, haven't worked in the past and shouldn't now. SAMIRA GUTOC : There's no Muslim-Christian conflict here. Religion is not the problem. It is just about wackos out there who think that they have the monopoly of what's right. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE : But security analyst Rommel Banlaoi says the challenges in Mindanao go way beyond Muslim extremists. ROMMEL BANLAOI : From the ruling oligarchs, from the warlords, from the criminal groups and even from Christian local politicians - if the MILF cannot make a difference, then I think the Mindanao conflict will persist.

MITCH MCCONNELL : ISIS and al-Qaida have yet to be defeated. And American national security interests require continued commitment to our mission. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell there. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah, as the Senate did something it does not do that often - Republicans have been reluctant to break with President Trump, even when some may disagree with him. But they did just that yesterday, rebuking his decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley is with us this morning. Hi, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : As Steve noted, it is not that often that Republicans publicly break with President Trump on policy. Tell us exactly what was voted on yesterday. What are the consequences of it? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Well, Rachel, this rebuke of the president was big. And it was bipartisan. Sixty-eight senators voted for this resolution, including 43 out of 53 of Trump's fellow Republicans. The resolution is nonbinding, but it does give a strong sense of the Senate, that a precipitous withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan could put at risk what senators called the hard-won military gains that the U.S. has in those countries. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And, of course, the president had come out and said explicitly that he wants all troops out of Syria and kind of ripped the rug out from under negotiators in Afghanistan who are trying to come up with a peace deal. I mean, do you think Senate Republicans felt emboldened because of what they heard from intelligence officials this week on Capitol Hill? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Well, certainly, that was one of a number of areas where the intelligence community took issue with what the president has been saying. They stressed that ISIS has certainly not been defeated, even though its territorial holdings have been dramatically reduced. They said there's still a lot of ISIS fighters out there. And they still pose a potential threat. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Scott, I just want to note. I'm trying to do a little bit of math on the fly here. You said 43 Republicans voted to rebuke the president, that 68 overall did. It sounds to me like Democrats, actually, were more divided on this than Republicans were. The Republicans were more strongly in favor of keeping troops in Syria and Afghanistan. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Well - and in particular, the senators who are running for president (laughter) were mostly opposed to this resolution. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What does this mean practically for U.S. policy in these countries? I mean, does this - is this just talk, as we often hear, or does this actually affect the Pentagon's plans? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Hard to say for sure - obviously, this is not the first rebuke of the president. This is the issue that forced the resignation of Trump's defense secretary Jim Mattis, as well as his anti-ISIS czar Brett McGurk. And the president himself has already backpedaled somewhat, at least in terms of the timing of withdrawing troops from Syria. Remember; back in mid-December when he first announced this move, it was supposed to be virtually immediate. But then after a Christmas visit to Iraq, the president suggested, well, if the military needs a little bit more time, that's fine with him. In now the month and a half or so since the president's announcement, we've actually seen very little in the way of troop withdrawal, although there has been some equipment pulled out of Syria. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : So we'll see. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Just briefly before I let you go - another rift between Congress and the president - obviously, border security. This bipartisan group is trying to negotiate a deal to prevent another shutdown - President Trump now indicating none of what they are doing actually matters. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : In an interview with The New York Times, the president suggested that he is prepared to go ahead with a national emergency if the Democrats don't give ground at the bargaining table. Although we should say he has hinted that before and hasn't pulled the trigger yet. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott.

More than 130 people in the United States die every day because of an overdose on opioids. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : One common culprit is the painkiller OxyContin, which is produced by Purdue Pharma. And we now have a bit more information about the way that Purdue Pharma spread the use of that drug. New disclosures came from a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma in Massachusetts. They allegedly show that a member of the Sackler family, which owns Purdue, gave directions to the company in an email. And this email said to prioritize selling higher doses of OxyContin in 2008. That order came even after the company had admitted to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction. The disclosures also allege, by the way, that the Sacklers earned more than $4 billion in opioid profits just since 2007. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Martha Bebinger of WBUR is here to give us even more details. Martha, people will hear that and think, this is awful. Were people profiting knowing that these drugs were highly addictive? MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : That's right. This is a lawsuit, Rachel, that was filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She is claiming that Purdue and the Sacklers marketed the opioid drugs as safe, even though they knew the risk of addiction, and in doing so did help cause the opioid epidemic. Now, this is all playing out in Massachusetts, one of the hardest hit states, where between five and six residents are dying every day on average. And one report found that Massachusetts lost $15.2 billion as a result of the epidemic in 2017 alone. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What more can you tell us about these new filings that came out last night? MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : Well, the latest version of the complaint, which is the heart of this lawsuit that's been filed, lifts hundreds of lines that had been blacked out. So what we see now are board notes about payments that allegedly totaled hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the Sacklers. In 2009, for example, the complaint says the Sacklers paid themselves $335 million. They spent 122 on sales reps to ramp up their profits. At the same time, they allegedly acknowledged the harm OxyContin was causing by approving 2.7 million in personal injury claims. So, Rachel and Steve, there's some more in here. There's emails directly from the Sackler member, as Steve mentioned earlier, pushing for greater sales, allegedly. There's talk of Purdue starting to sell drugs that would treat addiction. So that's the problem they were allegedly fostering... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Yeah. MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : ...And also getting into the business of Narcan - the drug that reverses an opioid overdose. That plan did not go forward. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There are hundreds of lawsuits against Purdue in states and cities across the country for the company's role in the opioid epidemic. So how could this case in Massachusetts have an influence over those other suits? MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : Hundreds of those lawsuits are consolidated in one court in Ohio. The documents used to build this case that we're talking about in Massachusetts are all on file in Ohio. Massachusetts was the first state and the first suit to name the Sacklers and other board members. But other parties could use that same model going forward. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Any word from the Sacklers and Purdue on any of this? MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : The attorney for the Sacklers claim they don't even belong in the lawsuit. She - the attorney plans to argue that there's no jurisdiction because they had no direct dealings in Massachusetts. And Purdue says Massachusetts is just trying to vilify them, even though they had a small piece of the market and that the complaint is riddled with inaccurate allegations. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Wow - important story. WBUR's Martha Bebinger for us this morning about it. Thanks so much, Martha. We appreciate it. MARTHA BEBINGER, BYLINE : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR has learned about a new experiment that's being conducted here in the U.S., aimed at creating gene-edited human embryos. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Now, let's be clear. This experiment is not trying to make gene-edited babies. The world condemned a scientist for saying he'd done that in China. The goal of this new experiment is to see if it may someday be possible to safely make more gene-edited babies to prevent genetic diseases - seeing if it is someday possible. But this is still a controversial idea. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR health correspondent Rob Stein is breaking this exclusive news today. And he joins us this morning. Rob, who is conducting this experiment? ROB STEIN, BYLINE : So, Rachel, the scientist's name is Dieter Egli. And he's a developmental biologist at Columbia University in New York. And he says he's just trying to do the basic research to find out if a powerful new gene-editing technique known as CRISPR can repair genetic mutations in human embryos in the hopes of possibly - someday - allowing parents carrying genetic mutations that cause terrible diseases to have healthy babies. In this case, he's trying to fix a mutation that causes blindness. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So can you remind us how this is different than what happened in China? ROB STEIN, BYLINE : Yeah, so that scientist announced that two twin girls had been born using embryos that he had edited with CRISPR in his lab. And he said he did it to try to make them immune to the AIDS virus. But that was universally kind of condemned for being irresponsible and unethical because he rushed ahead before anyone knows if this kind of thing really works and, more importantly, would be safe. \n\n ###",

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand.  In a few minutes a preview of this weekend's new movies. ALEX CHADWICK, host : First, NPR News analyst Juan Williams.  Juan, here's a voice in the political debates this week. ALEX CHADWICK, host : President GEORGE W. BUSH:  Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals. ALEX CHADWICK, host : That's President Bush, of course speaking in Israel on his visit there, and he went on to the experience of World War II and Hitler. President BUSH : We have an obligation to call this what it is.  The false comfort of appeasement, which has been repeatedly discredited by history. ALEX CHADWICK, host : But Juan, it's current events that resonate here.  Iran, and Senator Obama saying that he would talk with hostile leaders. Isn't that really what Mr. Bush is saying here, and didn't the White House kind of both confirm that, and then denied that? JUAN WILLIAMS : Well, they did confirm it.  It's interesting though, the response from the White House, and from conservatives around Washington this week, was the president didn't mention any names.  What are these Democrats so excited about? JUAN WILLIAMS : It must be that they have guilty consciences, and they see their faces written large across the president's words, and of course Barack Obama, famously said in a debate with Hillary Clinton, that he would talk to people that had been previously treated as America's enemies.  But I don't think there's any doubt, that he was taking a political swipe at Senator Obama. JUAN WILLIAMS : And what really strikes me, is that you have a sense here of the question being, what would Senator Obama have to say to people in Hamas, or people in Iran.  The counter-argument coming from the Obama campaign is, well, we have to engage. ALEX CHADWICK, host : But Mr. Bush has been very clear in saying, he doesn't want to get involved in the political campaign at all.  He's turned away reporters' questions repeatedly at press conferences, saying that they're just edging into the political debate.  Do you think he's asserting perhaps now, that he will have some kind of role in the fall campaign? JUAN WILLIAMS : Well, as Senator Obama could only hope, Alex.  He would love to run against George W. Bush, a man with such low ratings.  Even Senator McCain is running against President Bush, if you stop and think about it.  I mean, on the war, on - he said, you know, let's have a time to get out now. JUAN WILLIAMS : Global warming, on Hurricane Katrina, talking with Congress. I think everybody is running against President Bush. So, I think his role will be slight and very tactful, if you will, and this is an example of it. ALEX CHADWICK, host : We spoke earlier in the program about this ruling by the California State Supreme Court, overturning the state's ban on gay marriage. Is this now going to be an issue in the fall campaign, gay marriage again? JUAN WILLIAMS : I'm not sure.  But I think that it picks up on something that is going to be an issue in the campaign, which is McCain making the charge that Senator Obama is out of touch. And by that extension, you would argue that, oh, look at what the California Supreme Court has done.  And if you think back to '04, after the Massachusetts' Supreme Court allowed gay marriage in that state, President Bush used it to his advantage, and especially in battleground mid-western states. JUAN WILLIAMS : Right now, that issue, according to Pew polling, is important, or very important to about 43 percent of American voters.  Forty-three percent is pretty high. The problem for McCain, unlike Bush, is that McCain has been opposed to a constitutional amendment, banning same-sex marriage.  That puts him in odds with some conservatives. JUAN WILLIAMS : And it makes him a dubious carrier for the message, you know, flying the banner of opposition to gay marriage.  He's someone who says that same-sex couples should have all the same rights.  But that's the same message that comes from Barack Obama. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I do see that Senator Obama is picking up more delegates.  He picked up some delegates from Senator Edwards this week.  He's getting closer. I think he's only about 130 delegates away, from that number of 2026 that he would need to secure the nomination. JUAN WILLIAMS : You're right.  I think we are getting closer, but I - what was really telling to me as an indicator of this, Alex, is watching a little TV and seeing the latest Obama ads in which he's got, you know, a picture of himself with a huge cross. He's talking about what a patriot he is. JUAN WILLIAMS : And large - the measure in response to the fact that the big advantage that Senator McCain holds over Senator Obama going forward, is that Americans see Senator McCain as better able to protect the country, while Obama holds a lead of course on issues like healthcare, and gasoline prices, and the economy. \n\n ###",

Is nothing sacred in this economy?  Now, beer drinkers are having to make sacrifices.  They're trading in their fancy micro brews for, well, something more ordinary. Marketplace's Nancy Marshall-Genzer is here now.  Nancy, so when did beer drinkers start going for the cheaper brews? NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Well, Madeleine, actually quite recently.  By the way, and just for research purposes, I'm actually cracking open a can of beer here, so I can totally (unintelligible)... MADELEINE BRAND, host : It's just so I can relate little better. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Yeah, I wish I could share, but you know, that would be a cross-country beer run, because I'm in Washington, you're in L.A.  But I will drink to your health. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Thank you. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Welcome.  So, you were asking when the cheaper beer started getting more popular.  Miller's CEO Tom Long says, they started noticing an increase in sales of economy beers in January.  And it looks like that increase came at the expense of higher-priced beers.  Long says sales of Miller genuine draft, for example, were down more that 10 percent. MADELEINE BRAND, host : OK.  I'll let you have another sip. I'll ask you this question. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Oh, thank you.  Thank you. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So Miller, Long, they're blaming the economy.  They're saying people just can't afford to buy fancy beer. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : That's exactly right.  And Long says, this is a direct result of people having less disposable income, less money in their pockets every week.  Now, a lot of people assume that we drink more during tough economic times.  And listening to me, you'd think that is the case. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Clearly. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : But I asked David Henkes about that today, before I started drinking.  And he's a food and beverage industry analyst with Technomic. Mr. DAVID HENKES (Food and Beverage Industry Analyst, Technomic) : People drink differently in a down economy.  I don't know - want to say that they drink more or drink less, you know, but clearly, there's some behavior modification going on that is coming as part of the economy. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : And I imagined, Madeleine, there's quite a bit of behavior modification going on, when people drink, but that's a different subject. And thus far, all we know for sure, is that people are actually drinking cheaper beer. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Cheaper beer.  What about cheaper wine?  Do you have a bottle of Night Train stashed in your desk? NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Unfortunately, I didn't have time to go out and get some wine.  I just got the beer.  That will be later.  But it does look like people are drinking cheaper wine.  And I have that at least anecdotally.  I got the picture on wine from Dennis Manuel.  And he's a wine rep for Strange Wines there in Los Angeles. Mr. DENNIS MANUEL (Wine Representative for Strange Wines, Los Angeles) : The retailers are doing well now, they tell me, because I think people are buying wine, and drinking it at home, rather than going out to restaurants, and having dinners, and drinking wine. NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : And yes, people are bringing cheaper wine home.  Manuel says they are bringing it home.  It's in a 10 to 20 dollar range.  And those bottles are selling quite well. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Hmm.  So, but that comes at the expense of the restaurants? NANCY MARSHALL GENZER : Yeah.  And we have some numbers on that.  In the first quarter of this year, 31 percent of consumers said they had a drink away from home.  That's down from 42 percent last year. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : In just a minute, we'll get to our weekly Bloggers' Roundtable. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : But first, an update on the stories building - buzz on our blog News and Views. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I am joined by NEWS & NOTES Web producer Geoffrey Bennett. Hey, Geoff. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Hey, Farai. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : There's all this B-L buzz blogosphere blah, blah, blah. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Right. It's a bit much, right? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : But we do have bluzz in the blogosphere. So what are we talking about? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Well, we're talking about, as you talked about earlier in the show, the differing emergency responses to the California wildfires and Hurricane Katrina. We posed the question on our blog, is it fair to make a comparison? And if so, what are the differences? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Now, some said it was a simple matter of leadership. Others said it boiled down to differences of race and class. Now, here's what folks said. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Raven Beasley(ph), who reads our blog, says the difference between Katrina and the California fires are two different classes of citizens: rich versus poor, black versus white. GEOFFREY BENNETT : Our reader named Leila(ph) who actually lives in Southern California wrote, fires are common in the area. And, luckily, we have state and local governments that are prepared for an event like this. GEOFFREY BENNETT : And Ernice(ph), one of our listeners who comes to our blog pretty frequently, says, I look at the success of California's evacuation as a positive from the disaster of Katrina and what happened at the Super Dome. Hopefully, those that were spearheading the effort learned what not to do. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, we also had a heated conversation about race and intelligence. What's the response been? GEOFFREY BENNETT : Yeah. We started following that issue right after a geneticist, James Watson, made the comment about Africans being intellectually inferior to Westerners. Watson has since apologized. He's been suspended by his research institution, but folks in our blog were not sympathetic in the least. Some people call it scientific racism. GEOFFREY BENNETT : One person said, since race is a social construct, not a biological one, that alone undermines this line of research. GEOFFREY BENNETT : A woman named Judy Wylene(ph), who reads our blog, says, data in itself is value neutral, the question is always what people will do with it. GEOFFREY BENNETT : And Cee Robinson(ph), a reader who goes by the handle - goes by that handle, said, the saddest thing is not that another esteemed scientist asserts blacks to intellectually inferior; what's sad is that many blacks deep down in their gut also believe it to be true. They believe in their own inferiority. GEOFFREY BENNETT : And so that conversation is still ongoing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah. And what are some of the other popular topics popping off? \n\n ###",

I'm Alex Chadwick. MADELEINE BRAND, host : I'm Madeleine Brand.  Well, it's not here yet.  You have to wait one more week, until the summer blockbuster Indiana Jones hits theaters.  Meanwhile, searching for fashion, and a father, and a dreamy prince, are all possibilities this weekend at the movies. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Two are smaller indie films.  One could bring in some royal box-office figures.  Here with slate.com summary judgment is Mark Jordan Legan. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : A film starring America Ferrera, TV's Ugly Betty, is getting a re-release because of Ferrera's new popularity. The indie comedy, \"How the Garcia Girls Spent Their Summer,\" focuses on three generations, dealing with love and romance during a heat wave.  Elizabeth Pena also stars. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Unidentified Actress #1:  How can you go out in public dressing like that? MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Unidentified Actress #2:  What's wrong with wearing this? MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Unidentified Actress #1:  I can see everything in that dress. Ms. AMERICA FERRERA : (As Blanca) You should just wear a thong, because then you wouldn't see the underwear line, or you could just wear no underwear. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : The critics feel like flirting with these Garcia girls.  The Chicago Tribune gushes a subtly, beautiful tapestry, that's both entertaining and deeply effecting, and Film Thread calls it a quaint little film that's easily overlooked, but a savory lazy day treat, if noticed and given a chance.  Next up in limited release, is the foreign drama \"Sangre de Mi Sangre,\" where a young Mexican immigrant travels to New York City to find the father he's never met, only to fall victim to a con man. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Unidentified Actor #1:  Hey. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : Unidentified Actor #2:  Senor?  Papa? MARK JORDAN LEGAN : The nation's critics praised, and slammed the film, which won the Sundance Grand Jury prize a few years back.  Contrite, but compelling, complains the Village Voice. New York magazine offers \"Sangre de Mi Sangre\" serves up an old-fashioned, sentimental weepy, with a sucker punch of urban, immigrant horror. MARK JORDAN LEGAN : And the New York Times sighs, grim and frustrating.  The major release today, is the sequel to 2005's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.  Many of you might have seen the brooding, bedroom-eyes of hot young actor Ben Barnes, wielding a sword on all the billboards promoting, \"The Chronicles of Narnia:  Prince Caspian.\" Mr. BEN BARNES : (as Prince Caspian) I think it's time we found out what went on here.

Do investigators check the flight of every bullet? What kind of questions do officers face, and what kind of sanctions if they messed up?

The address again is talk@npr.org. But first, what happens after police officers open fire? We begin with David Klinger, a former cop in Los Angeles and Redmond, Washington. He now teaches criminology and wrote about the use of deadly force in his book \"Into the Kill Zone,\" and joins us by phone from Houston. Nice to have you with us today. DAVID KLINGER : Thanks for having me on again. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And this is both your area of study and your story. DAVID KLINGER : Yes it is. NEAL CONAN, HOST : What happened? DAVID KLINGER : When I was a young police officer in Los Angeles, four months out of the academy, a crazy guy with a knife tried to murder my partner, stabbed him in the chest, knocked him on the ground. I was on the other side of the street. As I'm running across the street, the suspect jumped on top of my partner and tried to drive the knife through his throat. DAVID KLINGER : My partner managed to grab the suspect's wrist and prevent that from happening. When I got to my partner's side a few seconds later, I tried to disarm the suspect, wasn't able to and had to shoot him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it sounds like there couldn't be anything more clear cut, yet I suspect you've been thinking about that off and on ever since. DAVID KLINGER : Not ever since, but it took me about 20 years. The first 20 years, there were some difficult moments. And then about 10 years ago, I said: You know what, Dave? It does nobody any good. The situation's behind. And as you pointed out, Neal, there really wasn't anything else that could be done. And I came to peace with it, and I've been fine ever since. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Now as you have approached this from a professional standpoint, did you find a lot of studies of police officers and how they used their weapons and what happened afterwards? DAVID KLINGER : There hadn't been a lot of studies back in the late '90s, which is what led me to do the study that I did that led to my book. And basically, for \"Kill Zone,\" what I did - it was a study that was funded by the United States Department of Justice, interviewed 80 cops around the nation who'd been involved in shootings. And one of the things I asked them about was what happened in the aftermath. DAVID KLINGER : And to make a very long story short, the vast majority of officers in the short term have some notable disruption in terms of intrusive thoughts, in terms of maybe an inability to sleep or something like that. But after a few weeks, for most officers, those problems dissipate. And so the long-term consequences for most officers are actually quite good. Only about 20 percent of the officers had any sort of negative consequence that lingered past three months. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And in the majority of cases, as in the vast majority of cases, as in your case, the investigation that succeeds an incident like that finds that the officer was not at fault, did nothing wrong. But these are - these are tricky moments for a police officer, no? DAVID KLINGER : Oh, absolutely. And, you know, my situation was, as you pointed out, clear-cut. I knew exactly what I was dealing with. It was an individual who was trying to murder a fellow officer. Sometimes it's not so clear-cut. DAVID KLINGER : I've been in numerous situations when I was a young officer where I could have shot, but decided not to because the posture of the suspect, because the way he or she was manipulating the gun in their hand, that type of thing. And also circumstances where officers shoot, they think there's a gun, it turns out there's not a gun. Then it becomes highly problematic. So... NEAL CONAN, HOST : A case just in Texas in the last couple of weeks of an eighth-grader holding a realistic-looking toy, and it turns out that he was shot to death. Obviously, we're going to have to wait for the investigation to find out all the details there, but this happens too often. And wow, those officers must feel terrible. DAVID KLINGER : Yeah. You know, police officers sign up to protect the public from dangerous threats. And when, as in the case you just mentioned, everything appears to look like I have a serious threat. Here's an individual who has brought a gun to school, you know, guns in our sanctuaries. We cannot let this individual kill children. And then it turns that it is a not-gun or a replica gun or a toy gun, that's got to weigh very difficult on the officers. DAVID KLINGER : And, you know, some of the 80 officers that I interviewed for \"Kill Zone\" had been involved in circumstances where they shot people, fully believing that the suspect was armed with a deadly weapon, and it turned out it was a replica or something. And the officers had a very, very difficult time dealing with that. \n\n ###",

He wrote a series last year on the use of deadly force by police officers. Among those he spoke with was David Klinger, who's also with us today. And he joins us now from KNPR in Las Vegas. So nice to have you on the program with us today. LAWRENCE MOWER : Thank you for having me, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I was interested, just given what David Klinger was just saying, yes, I think we hear about it often when police officers fire their weapons with tragic results. We don't hear about it when they don't. LAWRENCE MOWER : No, that's true, absolutely. And these are still relatively rare incidents. Here we found that, you know, metro police, Las Vegas Metro Police, the big agency here, shoots their - you know, fires their weapons at people around 17 times a year, and they are relatively rare incidents. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And relatively rare, nevertheless, it seems that at least there, the investigations that follow have - is it fair to say universally cleared officers? LAWRENCE MOWER : Almost. What we found was that: One, there was a lot of shootings here. Also that the department was very reluctant to learn from its incidents, learn from its shootings, and that they were reluctant to hold officers accountable for them. And really, the review process in place was fairly lax. LAWRENCE MOWER : In the last decade, Metro's review board had cleared 99 percent of officers who were involved in any kind of incident, serious incident like a shooting. And - but also, the criminal review process was fairly lax, also. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Reluctant to do that because they feared for morale, because why? LAWRENCE MOWER : Well, it's interesting. The board that they had set up here - and they still do have set up here - was dominated by citizens. And what we found kind of interesting is we talked to the citizens, and they were very much, very pro-police. They had difficulty holding officers accountable for these incidents. LAWRENCE MOWER : Oftentimes, it was the officers on the board who were harder on their own officers than the citizens were. But, you know, what you've heard over time from police also is that, well, we don't want to second-guess another officer's decision to use deadly force because these incidents are so rare, and they're not as clear cut, often, as, you know, an officer beating someone up. Well, many officers would not justify that. So - go ahead. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I was just going to ask David Klinger to come in and say, is that - is the experience there in Las Vegas, do you think, replicated across much of the country? DAVID KLINGER : In terms of the sense that most shootings are held to be justified? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes. DAVID KLINGER : Yeah, absolutely. And a dispassionate observer who looked at the investigative case files of the vast majority of shootings would have to come to the same conclusion. There are some bad shootings. There's no doubt about that. And when I say a bad shooting, I mean one where a police officer didn't make either a good-faith mistake or some other thing that would come up that we would say, gosh, you know, we don't like this. We don't - we wish it hadn't happened, but it's perfectly justified. DAVID KLINGER : There's a term of art called awful, but lawful. So sometimes officers are involved in shootings that don't really sound that good, but the law says it was an appropriate use of force. So if you take the ones where it's clear-cut justified, then some of these other ones, there's only going to be a few where an officer is clearly out of bounds. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get a caller involved in the conversation. We want to hear from police officers today. What happened after you fired your weapon? 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. Jeff is on the line with us from Houston. JEFF : Good afternoon. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. JEFF : Well, this happened a few years ago when I was in narcotics. On my way after home after shift, a car driving erratic early in the morning. I pulled the guy over, just, you know, to see what was going on. When I came back with his license, he fired rounds into my chest. So, of course, I fired back. He ended up - it became fatal. And after my paid time off and everything, you know, for their investigation, it was justified. JEFF : But I guess it was just - it was more hard for me to get over because of the age and that it was just, you know, I had lots of friends with kids that age. And it was just - you know, to this day it's still hard. \n\n ###",

JEFF : It went through. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It went through. JEFF : I was what - I got hit with armored rounds, unfortunately. They figured out afterwards, about a month later, that he had picked them up off of a friend, that his dad was military. And that's where, apparently, he got them from. So, you know, he hadn't been in any trouble, nothing. And I was just - you know, I was going to give him a verbal warning, and (technical difficulties). NEAL CONAN, HOST : I'm afraid we're losing your cell phone, Jeff. Are you OK? Are you doing OK? I think we've lost him, and I apologize. We certainly hope Jeff is doing OK, and can understand his anguish. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is an email we have from Isaac in St. Paul, Minnesota: I'm an attorney for a police union in Minnesota. I was also living in New York City at the time of the Amadou Diallo shooting, which was widely portrayed as an example of trigger-happy cops. Now that I've worked with police for several years, I have a much better appreciation for the dangers they face and the split-second decisions they have to make. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I don't know if the Diallo shooting was justified, but I know now just how complex some of these cases really are. And David Klinger, that, of course, was the case where a man in the Bronx was thought to have a weapon and was, I think, hit 41 times. DAVID KLINGER : Yeah. To make a very long story short, the officers believed that they were dealing with a criminal who was pulling a gun on them, and it turned out that he was pulling a wallet. And that's one of those ones of, you know, lawful but awful, where the officer misperceives - I've written about it, and Malcolm Gladwell in his book \"Blink\" gives a very, very good, detailed account of how it is that his officers came to perceive it the way that they did. DAVID KLINGER : And anybody that's interested in learning about that particular case would do well to take a look at that chapter in the book \"Blink.\" NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking about what happens when police use deadly force. If you're a cop, call and tell us what happened after you discharged your weapon. 800-989-8255. You can send us an email: talk@npr.org. We'll have more in just a minute. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. When police officers respond to a call, enter the home of a suspect or even make a routine traffic stop, they never know what might happen next. In New Orleans this morning, police investigating a shooting inside a house tracked a vehicle they believed contained the gunman. New Orleans PD says one of those in that vehicle opened fire on police; that person was then shot and killed by police officers. An investigation will inevitably follow. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So police officers, tell us, what happened after you fired your weapon? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Our guest is David Klinger, a former police officer with the Los Angeles and Redmond, Washington, police departments; and Lawrence Mower, a reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal is also with us. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Burt(ph), Burt with us from Reno. BURT : Hi, how are you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good, thanks. BURT : Thanks for taking my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, please. BURT : I have a different perspective on this entire scenario in that I was a supervisor here in Nevada for the Nevada Highway Patrol, and I do believe firmly that training the officers that work on that department will keep the number of shootings to a minimum, and they know when they can fire their weapon and when they should not fire that weapon. BURT : And I'm not saying for one moment that officers should be - should jeopardize their safety by not firing when necessary; however, there are instances where by law you can fire that weapon and kill someone, and it could have totally been avoided. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I understand that. In your police department, were there investigations? BURT : Absolutely there were investigations. \n\n ###",

BURT : I was in charge of some of those. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And that must be very difficult to investigate your fellow officers. BURT : It is difficult; however, right is right and wrong is wrong, and I might be the minority when it comes to law enforcement officers, but I believe that the citizens that you serve should be provided with highly trained professionals so that in the event of a shooting, the question as to whether that officer was justified or not could be minimized. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, thanks very much for the call, Burt, and Lawrence Mower, you wrote in your series in the Las Vegas Review-Journal several instances in which officers would have been perfectly justified, by law and by circumstance, to have opened fire, did not and proved to be right. LAWRENCE MOWER : No that's true, and your caller brings up a good point in that, you know, the vast majority of these things are legally justified and perhaps even morally justified, too, in the vast majority of the time. But what we found is that some of them can be avoided by tactics and really looking at, OK, did the officer place themselves in a position of danger. LAWRENCE MOWER : For example, we had a case here where officers trying to apprehend a - a person who was fencing stolen goods, they caught him coming out of the store. The person, the suspect jumped into the passenger side of a car. One officer went to the passenger side of the car to try to pull him out. Well, the driver took off. LAWRENCE MOWER : And now the officer is in a situation where they're being dragged, and the officer is in a situation where either you shoot to kill the driver and stop the car, or you, you know, let go and be crushed by the car potentially. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So difficult choice. LAWRENCE MOWER : Absolutely, and that's a case where, you know, the officer was certainly legally justified and had no other option in that situation, but nevertheless, it could have been avoided, and other departments that have policies that say don't reach into running or - basically don't reach into vehicles. LAWRENCE MOWER : Well, Las Vegas police don't have that kind of policy. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There was also a finding that you made that suggested that police officers involved in shootings, if they're involved in several shootings, well, yes, circumstances can mount, and someone can be unfortunate, but nevertheless, it does seem to form a pattern. LAWRENCE MOWER : Well, sometimes. What we found was that - I mean, some officers in a lot of shootings are in, for example, the SWAT team, where you might be more prone to have a lot of shootings, and you can't really make a moral judgment based on that or, you know, a personnel judgment. LAWRENCE MOWER : But what we did find is patterns of officers being involved in multiple shootings, sometimes they had other disciplinary problems, and some of their shootings were, you know, problematic to say the least. One cop we looked at was involved in three fatal shootings in five years, and in each of those shootings, the person who was shot was a vagrant. There were no witnesses to any of the shootings, and the officer's judgment was highly questionable by people inside and outside the department. LAWRENCE MOWER : And yet the officer was allowed to stay on for a number of years until he was fired for disciplinary reasons. NEAL CONAN, HOST : David Klinger, is it widespread that, as Lawrence Mower says, in the case in Las Vegas, that police departments are reluctant to try to draw lessons from their shooting incidents? DAVID KLINGER : What I found is that most of the agencies around the country are actually quite interested in drawing lessons. And for example my old agency Los Angeles, one of the things that they have been doing for many years is having essentially a tactical review of the incident to say what could the officers have done differently, if anything, in order to either reduce the likelihood of a shooting or to reduce the likelihood of collateral damage, you know, a citizen being damaged, injured, so on and so forth. DAVID KLINGER : In fact, I'm presently involved in a project with the Bureau of Justice Assistance, another branch of the United States Department of Justice, where I'm interviewing officers around the country and asking them what are the lessons that we can learn from your incident. And it's going to be fed back into American law enforcement, and this is at the highest levels of USDOJ. DAVID KLINGER : And so my experience is that most agencies really do want to learn from what goes on in shootings and in fact, as I indicated, that's something that the federal government is involved in currently. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get another caller in. This is John(ph), John with us from Southern California. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, please. JOHN : One of the things that I noticed that your - I'm sorry, the person you're interviewing isn't talking about is the way that police officers are treated after the shooting. It almost feels adversarial in nature. I was involved in a shooting myself a few hours off a training. It was covered by national news, and it was a huge incident. JOHN : And, I mean, there was no doubt that I was in the right, but still the fact they take your gun away while you're on-scene, they put you in a patrol car, they separate the different people in the shootings. There's a way that they do it, but it just really feels like they're treating me like a criminal, and I'd like them to speak a little bit about that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : David Klinger? DAVID KLINGER : Well, that's unacceptable. One of the things that I do and other people around the country do is train agencies about post-shooting protocols. And to disarm an officer at the scene, there's no reason for that. There's a time and a place to get the officer's weapon for evidence collection, and that's back at the station once the officer is safe, once the scene is secured, so on and so forth. DAVID KLINGER : There's got to be some sort of an adversarial process because there's always the question in our democracy whether an officer used deadly force appropriately. So there has to be a careful investigation of the facts. However, it doesn't have to be adversarial in the sense of trying to make it look as if the officer did something wrong. DAVID KLINGER : When I say adversarial, the district attorney has to take a look at it, make sure everything's squared away. But I agree with the officer: If an agency is not treating the officer with the respect that they deserve - because after all, what happens is they trained the officer, they hired the officer, they gave him a gun, they said go out, and under these circumstances deadly force is appropriate - unless and until there is some evidence that the officer did something wrong, the officer shouldn't be treated like a criminal suspect. NEAL CONAN, HOST : John, how long ago was this? JOHN : It was back in 2005. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Do you think procedures have changed? JOHN : You know, after that happened, I'm sure they probably did. I've talked to other departments, and they also said the same thing that Mr. Klinger said. It's just I'm not sure how often that happens. That was just my take on the incident and what happened with me and with the other officers. There were actually five officers involved. Thirty-eight shots were fired, and eight of them hit him, and he still lived. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And - the person you were firing at? JOHN : Yeah, the person still lived. They had to put him in a coma for a few days, and then he came back out of the coma. He had double the amount of crystal meth that you would expect on a suspect. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And were all the officers OK? JOHN : All of them were fine. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And how long did this process take, all told? JOHN : Let's see, it started about 5 o'clock in the morning. We were probably done by around noon or 1 o'clock. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And then how long did the investigation take? How long was it before you got your weapon back? JOHN : Well, they give you on the (unintelligible), administrative leave for a week, and then you come back. You have to go see a psych first to make sure that you're OK, and that was pretty much it. \n\n ###",

JOHN : No, no problems at all. Yeah, I mean, I think just the main thing, I just felt the way that they treated me at the time, I'm glad that Mr. Klinger spoke to that, that that wasn't correct. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, John, thanks very much, appreciate the phone call. JOHN : All right, thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Lawrence Mower, that procedure he described, a week on the beach, administrative leave, is that what they do in Las Vegas, too? LAWRENCE MOWER : That's kind of the norm nationwide is that you give officers time to see a psychologist and really make sure you're OK because it's interesting, one of your earlier callers kind of talked about this was I talked to a cop who was involved in a - in combat in Vietnam, and he was later involved in police shootings. And he said that, you know, in combat it's - not that it's not traumatic, but that you don't - you often don't know who you're shooting. You don't know anything about that person. LAWRENCE MOWER : But if you're a police officer, you're going to find out everything there is to know about that guy through the, well, usually through the press and through your own - your department's investigation. You'll know that that person had a family, had loved ones, was loved by someone and it's - in my interviews with officers they - a lot of them really struggled with that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, David Klinger, we find - again our experience with the military is that there is a degree of, first of all, denial and then there's a degree of soldiers and Marines unwilling to report for counseling because - well, they fear, what it's going to make them look like to their fellow soldiers and Marines, and it's also they don't want to be pulled out in the line of duty. Does the same kind of syndrome affect police officers? DAVID KLINGER : I don't know that we could call it a syndrome in terms of how widespread it is, but certainly in my first study that I did for the Department of Justice, the one that led \"Into the Kill Zone,\" several officers did mentioned that they did not feel comfortable talking to anybody in the organization, particularly the police psychologist or psychiatrist because they did not believe that they would be treated well, i.e., they might be pulled off the line. Someone might think that they weren't capable of doing their jobs. DAVID KLINGER : And so yes, there is, at least, for some officers sans that because it could redound negatively on them professionally that they want to keep stuff close to the vest as opposed to go in getting the help of perhaps they might need. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with David Klinger, a former police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department and the police department in Redmond, Washington. He's currently professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. He's with us by phone in Houston. His book is \"Into the Kill Zone.\" NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lawrence Mower is also with us, a reporter for the Las Vegas Review Journal. His series on deadly force ran in the Review-Journal last November. He's with us from the studios of the Nevada Public Radio in Las Vegas. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We also spoke earlier about the case of Amadou Diallo in New York and I misspoke. There were 41 shots fired. He was hit 19 times. A caller came in with a correction. We thank them for that. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And let's see if we go next to Chet(ph). And Chet's with us from Moultrie in Georgia. CHET : Hi, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, Chet. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. CHET : Sorry, I had you on speaker. Boy, my attitude's changed listening to everybody's call. I've been through two and they were both completely different. And I don't even know where to start. I get all emotional talking about it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, tell us about the first one. CHET : Well, the first one was just something that a police officer probably would have no problem dealing with. It was an inmate trying to escape and he was also a mental patient. He grabbed another officer's gun and shot that officer in the face right in front of me, and then fired a shot at me, and then we - he ran out. And I chased him out and eventually, well, there was a lot of shooting back in forth and he was eventually shot. That was obviously one of those cut-and-dried situations. CHET : The second one was not. The first one happened early when I was in my 20s. The second one happened in 2005, like the officer you just talked to a few minutes ago, late in my career. And it turns out the guy was trying to rob a Coke machine of all things, and I thought he was trying to - I thought the thing had taken his money so I came up unprepared for an aggressive personality. And when he thought that I was there to arrest him because - I didn't know it but in his vehicle which was parked there were items that he had taken from a burglary. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...edition of the Political Junkie. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN : There you go again. VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE : When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: Where's the beef? VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE : SEN.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Every Wednesday Political Junkie Ken Rudin joins us to recap the week in politics. He's at New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord, which played host to both of us last weekend. And the big surprise is no surprise. Next door neighbor Mitt Romney wins big and early. Ron Paul seems set for the long haul and everybody else faces major questions as they head toward the Palmetto State. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In a few minutes we'll speak with former Representative Bob Inglis about the primary there, plus a shakeup at the White House congressional resignations in California. The Supreme Court hears arguments on Texas redistricting and we'll remember conservative gadfly Tony Blankley. Later in this hour, hour-long Junkie, New York Times columnist Bill Keller on that much-rumored, loved, hated, unlikely Obama-Clinton ticket. But first Political Junkie joins us today from Concord and we begin, as we always do, with a trivia question. Hey, Ken. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Hi, Neal. As they say up here, I came, I saw, I Concord . KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah, OK. Well, I thought I'd try that one. OK. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm much funnier in Washington than I am... NEAL CONAN, HOST : You are. Yeah. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yes. OK. The trivia question is, who was the last person - since we're looking ahead to South Carolina - who was the last person to win the South Carolina primary but not be his party's presidential nominee? NEAL CONAN, HOST : A state with a reputation for picking winners. The last person to win the South Carolina primary but not be his party's presidential nominee. If you think you know the answer, give us a call 800-989-8255. You can also zap us an email, talk@npr.org. Of course the winner will get a fabulous Political Junkie no-prize t-shirt. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Ken, we waited till 3:00 in the morning to get the results from Iowa. Not so much drama last night. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : No. I think NPR called it at 8:00 and 30 seconds. It was disappointing for those of us junkies who love protracted and exciting nights, but it was an interesting night nonetheless. I mean there was always the question about Mitt Romney and the expectation game. Would he win by as much as he should have won? Did his win convince people, those who had doubts after the close race in Iowa? And I think Romney got out of New Hampshire what he wanted. \n\n ###",

He is clearly, I mean, here we go again, but he is clearly the frontrunner. And with polls have him leading in South Carolina on January 21 and Florida January 31, there are some people who think that this nomination battle could be ended by the end of the month. And another thing we also learned about Iowa is the fact that we've seen in the past social conservatives do very, very well there, as Rick Santorum did, as Pat Robertson did in '88, as Mike Huckabee did last time. And all three did not so well in moderate-leaning New Hampshire. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, you talked about Mitt Romney re-established, if there was any doubt at all, as the frontrunner. And for the most part, in New Hampshire and last night in his victory speech, running as the presumed candidate, not against his rivals we'll hear more about that a little later in the program - but against the president. MITT ROMNEY : He promised to bring people together. He promised to change the broken system in Washington. He promised to improve our nation. Those were the days of lofty promises made by a hopeful candidate. Today we're faced with a disappointing record of a failed president. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A failed president. And that's going to be a theme he's going to continue. He can afford to raise his sights, if you will, while others are going to be sniping at him. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, to be honest with you, that's been Mitt Romney's strategy from almost - from the onset, that he has almost ignored or decided to ignore his fellow Republicans and go after President Obama at every opportunity. He did that throughout most of the debates. It wasn't until they started going after him - Rick Perry was one of the beginners - where Romney not so much would respond in kind, but he would have these super-PACs that would do the dirty work on his behalf. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : We saw that in Iowa when his super-PAC virtually demolished Newt Gingrich with negative ads, and of course Newt Gingrich is going to try to return the favor in South Carolina. But for the most part, Romney's strategy's always been - the domination is not so much mine but the real target should be President Obama. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In the meantime, there is a credible second place finisher and that is Ron Paul. He, of course, called to congratulate his rival, Mitt Romney, but then took a dig at the conservative establishment. RON PAUL : I wanted to thank the Union Leader for not endorsing me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Pretty enthusiastic crowd there at Ron Paul headquarters of the union leader - of course the Manchester union leader a long time a kingmaker. In New Hampshire this time around they endorsed Newt Gingrich. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, yes, you could say it's very influential and it is very influential. When it endorsed Gingrich, it was filled with anti-Romney broadsides, but if you go to the history of the Union Leader endorsement, Steve Forbes in 2000, Pat Buchanan in 1992, Pete DuPont - you remember President Pete DuPont, right? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Of course. Yes. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : In 1988. John Ashbrook against Nixon in '72. So yes, they're very influential. Yes, they are a large conservative voice in New Hampshire, but kingmakers, not always. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And anyway, Ron Paul was saying he is the challenger to the Republican establishment. RON PAUL : But I sort of have to chuckle when they describe you and me as being dangerous. RON PAUL : That's one thing they are telling the truth, because we are dangerous to the status quo of this country. UNIDENTIFIED CROWD : President Paul, President Paul, President Paul... NEAL CONAN, HOST : President Paul, the chant there at the end, and boy, you take out the new voters that Ron Paul brought to the caucuses in Iowa, and if you take out the new voters that Ron Paul brought to the primary in New Hampshire, Republican turnout is lower than it was in 2008 in both places. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And that is surprising because everybody thought that the Republicans were on the defensive, in a funk, in 2008, on the defensive over President Bush, the war in Iraq, the faltering economy. And yet here it is, 2008, when they're supposedly on the ascendancy. They have the backing of the Tea Party, which has put new dynamism into the party, and yet the numbers aren't that much different than 2012. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But one thing about Ron Paul that we learned. First of all, of course he's not going away, nor should he go away, but we always thought that his strength would always be in the caucuses and the fact that he was organized, his supporters very fervent true-believers, but not do as well in the primary. Yesterday in New Hampshire we show that - we saw that he could be very strong in both. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question, and that is the last person to win the South Carolina primary and not get his party's endorsement for president of the United States. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to weigh in.

TROY : I think she won South Carolina. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : No, no, no. She was elected to the Senate in North Carolina but by the time the South Carolina primary happened in 2000, she was out of the race. As a matter of fact, I think she was out of the race in 1999. TROY : I think it was '88. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Elizabeth Dole didn't run for president in 1988. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Troy. TROY : OK. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I'm sorry. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That's OK. Lisa's(ph) on the line calling from Chapel Hill. LISA : Hi. I'd like to guess John Edwards from 2004. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : John Edwards is the correct answer. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ding, ding, ding. LISA : Oh, yay. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I was waiting for the ding, ding, ding. Nobody \u2013 no Republican has ever \u2013 every Republican who has won the South Carolina primary has gone on to win its party's nomination but on the Democratic side John Edwards beat John Kerry in 2004 but did not get the nomination. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, congratulations, Lisa. Stay on the line. We'll collect your particulars and mail you off a Political Junkie no prize t-shirt in exchange for your promise of a digital picture of yourself thusly attired that we can post on our Wall of Shame.

And we also have to note Kurt Fredrickson(ph) \u2013 this bulletin just handed to me \u2013 sent us an email winner from Renton, Washington. So we have two Political Junkie no prize winners this week. He had the correct answer: John Edwards. Of course, arriving at that answer a real trial. In any case, as we move ahead... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Do we know how Kurt \u2013 do we know how Kurt feels about Ron Elving? NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think probably we do but we're not going to discuss that on this program. In the meantime, there were some other candidates, of course, and we can throw out Rick Perry. He did not compete in New Hampshire. He goes right on to South Carolina. We're going to get to South Carolina in a couple of minutes. But Rick Santorum, as you mentioned, has to be very disappointed. Newt Gingrich thought he could maybe recover some of that momentum he lost. Not so much. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : True. And although neither Santorum nor Gingrich put that much money into New Hampshire, the feeling from the beginning \u2013 I think one of the reasons why New Hampshire primary didn't get as much notice as in previous cycles is a lot of people thought that Mitt Romney had it won for the longest time and only when it got close did the candidates start to appear. But nobody really competed in New Hampshire other than Romney, Paul, and Jon Huntsman. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jon Huntsman came in out in third position and this is what he had to say. JON HUNTSMAN : And here we sit tonight, ladies and gentlemen, with a ticket to ride and to move on. Here we go to South Carolina. Thank you all so very much. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, he may not feel so good about that when he gets there. We're going to talk more about South Carolina and how the candidates will fare there when we come back after a short break. Of course, Political Junkie Ken Rudin will stay with us. We're also going to be talking with Bob Inglis who represented South Carolina's 4th Congressional District for 6 terms. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we'd like to hear from you as well. Those of you in South Carolina, what questions do the candidates have remaining that you have not heard answered? Give us a call 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. It's Wednesday, Political Junkie day. Ken Rudin is with us today from the studios at New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord. And Ken, do we have a ScuttleButton winner this week? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : We actually do. We actually do and it's not Jon Huntsman. It is Brad Bergman of Apple Valley, California. The last puzzle was Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. I'll explain some other time how we got to that puzzle. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But Brad Bergman is the winner. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you'd like to see this week's ScuttleButton puzzle or read Ken's column, you can go to npr.org/junkie. Mitt Romney's campaign has been crafting, and some might argue perfecting the aura of a general election candidate. By and large he's been laser focused on the president. MITT ROMNEY : President Obama \u2013 President Obama wants to put free enterprise on trial. In the last few days we've seen some desperate Republicans join forces with him. MITT ROMNEY : This is such a mistake for our party... MITT ROMNEY : UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: It is. Yeah. MITT ROMNEY : ...and for our nation. The country already has a leader who divides us with the bitter politics of envy. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In other words, an attack on me is an attack on the Republican Party as well as capitalism. Just try to take me down in South Carolina. That state votes 10 days from now on a Saturday. It's the first primary in the south with a more conservative electorate than New Hampshire for sure, and has a history, as we mentioned, of picking winners. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'd like to hear from those of you will vote in next week's contest. What questions still need to be answered by the candidates? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org.

Thanks for the opportunity, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Mitt Romney has won the first two primaries. Will South Carolina make it three in a row? BOB INGLIS : My guess is probably so, although I'm sure that Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have different plans in mind for that. But I would assume that Romney is in the lead. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah, we don't see him as a natural fit for what we always hear is a more military, more conservative, more evangelical Republican electorate. BOB INGLIS : Well, I think that that may be true, but on the other hand, I think people are looking for \u2013 Republicans are looking for someone who can win and so you've got somebody in Mitt Romney who's already won two contests and perhaps that sets him up with some look of inevitability. And so I think what takes over is mostly the desire to win against President Obama. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Have you endorsed anybody? BOB INGLIS : Have not. I don't want to hurt him. You know, I lost a primary in 2010, so it might him if... BOB INGLIS : ...if I supported him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Be the Union Leader of South Carolina. BOB INGLIS : Exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So avoiding being the kiss of death, if you had a druther, might you lean one way or the other without issuing an endorsement? BOB INGLIS : Well, I think that what needs to happen here, as a Republican and a guy who's very committed to a pro-growth kind of free enterprise, kind of answers, is we as Republicans need to aim at solutions and realize that at some point the scapegoat hunt will not be very effective, that if we just focused on beating Obama without a message about what we would do if we were elected, I worry about that as a successful governing strategy. BOB INGLIS : I think, you know, my idea of a great president, Ronald Reagan, came in with a real clear vision about what he wanted to accomplish and I hope that that's the posture that we would take to the White House if we were successful in retaking the White House, is go in with a message rather than, gee, we just weren't that guy that we just beat. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Congressman Inglis, you're talking about the general election, but before we get there, we also have, obviously, the South Carolina primary on the 21st and in the past, the history of South Carolina has always been that of a mud bath or a cesspool or whatever you want to call it. Four years ago \u2013 no, wait, I'm sorry \u2013 eight years ago in 2000, John McCain was \u2013 there were anonymous fliers that said that he had an illegitimate black child out of wedlock. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : It's rough and dirty in South Carolina and they expect that, you know, with the super PACs going on down there you're going to see more of the same come the 21st. BOB INGLIS : Yeah. Unfortunately, we've developed quite a reputation, haven't we? But it is a place where some key kind of contests have been decided because it's first in the South. I surely hope we'll avoid those kind of things this time around. But the key will be \u2013 I think South Carolina is looking for electability but also sort of split with this notion that, no, we want somebody that's truly conservative and truly reflects our values. BOB INGLIS : So the question is which one of those wins come Saturday. Is it the let's pick a winner, somebody that can win not just in South Carolina but elsewhere, or do we want somebody that we really would choose as somebody to enter into a business partnership with, somebody that we can actually agree with on most of their points? NEAL CONAN, HOST : And starting with the second of the debates over the past weekend, I think Mitt Romney's rivals tried to pin him with, wait a minute, we really don't agree with you on any number of points. And we're just going to play an excerpt from an ad that Newt Gingrich is running in South Carolina. NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: What happened after Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney changed his position from pro-abortion to pro-life? He governed pro-abortion. Romney appointed a pro-abortion judge, expanded access to abortion pills, put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board. And Romney signed government-mandated healthcare with taxpayer-funded abortions. Massachusetts moderate Mitt Romney. He can't be trusted. \n\n ###",

BOB INGLIS : Yeah, that's a stinging commercial for sure. Massachusetts moderate is a \u2013 let's just say that those are not positive words in South Carolina among Republicans. So \u2013 and it does remind of some of the likening people to Ted Kennedy Democrat. BOB INGLIS : And so Massachusetts moderate is sort of like that at times and with that heritage of loving to hate Senator Kennedy. So, yeah, that's a pretty effective commercial. It's also effective because abortion really does matter to many in the Republican primary electorate. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken Rudin, I wanted to ask you, Newt Gingrich has just gotten an injection of $5 million from one of his supporters, a casino mogul from Nevada. He is promising to expend those sources in South Carolina. Is this going to be his last stronghold? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, it looks like it. You wonder if Newt Gingrich is now thinking whether he wants to win the nomination or he just wants payback against Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney ran those, you know, his super PACs ran the anti-Gingrich ads in Iowa and Gingrich has shown \u2013 says he's going to show no hesitation going after Romney and his tenure at Bain Capital in South Carolina, although Rick Santorum has not followed that model. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : He said, look, is our own party going to be attacking capitalism? And then a lot of people are saying what Newt Gingrich is doing is an anti-capitalist kind of strategy. Now, Congressman Inglis is talking about a moderate for Massachusetts may be dirty words in South Carolina, but that doesn't mean that the South Carolina electorate will buy it, because I always feel that South Carolina is more of an establishment state. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : If Iowa is evangelical, if New Hampshire is independent, maybe South Carolina's the one who says, look, this is the guy we need to right our party and if that's the case, then Romney should do better than expected. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is also \u2013 you mentioned Bain and this is a super PAC which supports Newt Gingrich with a 30 minute documentary about Romney's time at Bain Capital. UNIDENTIFIED MAN : Their greed was only matched by their willingness to do anything to make millions in profits. Nothing was spared, nothing mattered but greed. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Bob Inglis, Mitt Romney counters, hey, Bain created 100,000 jobs, a claim has come under some scrutiny, but nevertheless, he says this is capitalism. This is the Republican Party. BOB INGLIS : Yeah. It's interesting what Ken was just saying there. It really does reflect a sort of a new kind of discussion that's going on, really, it's been the last \u2013 it's certainly the case in the 2010 cycle but if you \u2013 and it is in this cycle \u2013 the conversation between the Libertarian weighing at the Republican base and the more traditional Republican base, and it's going to be very interesting to see how much Ron Paul polls in South Carolina. BOB INGLIS : In more normal economic times, I think that that slice is a lot smaller. In these very difficult economic times, the Libertarian plus I'm just mad as heck and I'm not going to take it anymore kind of feeling drives those numbers higher. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And South Carolina hit more strongly by the recession than either Iowa or New Hampshire. Let's see if can get a caller in on the conversation. We want to hear from those of you in North - in South Carolina, excuse me. What questions left do you have for the candidates before you decide? Kevin's on the line, calling us there from Charleston, South Carolina. KEVIN : The question I have that they're really not addressing is: What are they going to do about Social Security and Medicare? I have an older parent, and she's dependent on that for her livelihood. And, you know, they don't have a really good reputation of wanting to sustain those programs. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Bob Inglis, we've not heard a lot about this since, I guess, Newt Gingrich described the Ryan plan as rightwing social engineering. BOB INGLIS : Yeah. Well, Kevin's onto something very important, and that is in order to fix a structural deficit, you have to address Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. And the thing that I'm disappointed, really, in the debate we've had thus far in the Republican presidential primary is very few are willing to address that directly. We sort of have heard a lot of blame about the Obama health care package, and we sort of tie in with that anger about that. But we haven't seen many people rising to the occasion of being able to say to folks that are very upset about the Obama health care package that it's really Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that it is a long-term structural deficit. BOB INGLIS : So figuring out a way do that while making sure that Kevin's relatives there that are needing Medicare and Social Security, their needs are met, that's a real challenge. And it takes some courage to address it. Thus far, we haven't seen a great deal of courage in that way. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Kevin, thanks very much for the call. KEVIN : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Congressman Inglis, I wanted to ask you, you mentioned earlier you hadn't endorsed anybody. Isn't it curious that so far, Jim DeMint, the senator from South Carolina who's, well, been something of a kingmaker - or aspiring to be elsewhere - he hasn't endorsed anybody, either. \n\n ###",

The video shows four U.S. Marines in Afghanistan in full combat gear, standing over the corpses of three men, laughing and urinating on the bodies. The audio is difficult to understand. NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Here's the tough guy (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I think so (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: I think yeah (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Look at mine. Yeah. (Unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Have a great day, buddy. NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It's so (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Unintelligible) may not (unintelligible). NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Just like a shower. NEAL CONAN, HOST : UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Standing the whole thing... NEAL CONAN, HOST : At one point, a man says, have a great day, buddy. Another asks, are you getting it on video? The response: Yup. The posting identifies the Marines as part of a scout sniper team from 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine regiment. That unit served in Afghanistan's Helmand province from March through September of last year. The Afghan Defense Ministry called the video shocking. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said: utterly deplorable. Many worry the incident will further inflame anti-American feelings, just as the U.S. tries to bring the Taliban into peace talks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This morning, the Pentagon promised a full investigation. We don't yet know who took the video or who released it. The Pentagon has, as we say, just identified two of the men involved, but says there's no reason to doubt the authenticity. And, of course, the YouTube video is brief. We don't know the full context. We'd like to hear from Marines today. How does this happen? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Captain Timothy Kudo is a Marine who left active service in March. He's a senior membership associate with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and joins us now from New York. And, Captain Kudo, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today. TIMOTHY KUDO : Thank you. I appreciate it. Good to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as I understand it, the unit you were with was in that exact part of Helmand province, was relieved by this unit of Marines. TIMOTHY KUDO : Yeah, that's correct. They relieved us in March this - of last year. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So can you tell us what the situation there was like? TIMOTHY KUDO : We were basically spread out over several positions. Our battalion had many, many positions over many square kilometers, and we were doing counterinsurgency. We were building up local governance, building schools, working with the locals and fighting the Taliban in the middle of all that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And how frequent was combat? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### TIMOTHY KUDO : It was almost daily, I would say. IEDs were definitely daily, sometimes many, many times a day. And firefights with the enemy, depending on where we went and how bold they decided to be, were very, very common. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So it is not unusual for Marines there to expect combat on a daily basis? TIMOTHY KUDO : I think every Marine expects combat every day. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As you looked at this video, what was your reaction? TIMOTHY KUDO : I was disgusted. I was disgusted as a Marine and as an American. And, you know, I think it's important to note that this is four individuals. They're completely outside of the values in the Marine Corps and everything that we taught them and believe in as - in terms of Marine Corps leadership, and how we're supposed to behave in a combat zone. And I think, frankly, that it's disappointing to myself as a Marine that they're going to be identified forever as Marines having had done this. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And how does this sort of thing happen? I know you can't speak to the specifics, we don't know, but in general. TIMOTHY KUDO : Well, I think it's a failure of leadership. I think, obviously, they went off the reservation and they acted rogue. And, you know, trying to get inside their heads is impossible because as a Marine, you're taught completely different things, and they didn't act as Marines. They acted as individuals. They acted doing something that's despicable, and it's clearly, you know, something root deep inside of them that caused them to do this thing. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It is unclear. The NCIS, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, has been asked to look into this, and obviously, we don't know what could happen to them. But from your experience, what might happen to them? TIMOTHY KUDO : Well, they'll do an investigation. They'll find out all the details. They'll get sworn statements and physical evidence, and then there will be probably a court martial, and presumably some of these of guys will be found guilty and they'll go to jail for a while. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go to jail. TIMOTHY KUDO : Mm-hmm. Go to the brig. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as somebody who's - everybody has a video camera of some sort today, these days. In - do you give your men any kind of instructions about their use and what appropriate is? TIMOTHY KUDO : Absolutely. I mean, I think as Marines, you break it down in simplest terms, and we tell them, you know, basically, don't be stupid. But they're given a lot more detailed instructions on what to photograph and what not to photograph. And dead bodies, mutilations, things like that, things that are very common in a war zone are obviously off-limits. You know, we'll take photos for investigative purposes at times, and those stay within the chain of command. They go through formal channels. TIMOTHY KUDO : But you're right. A lot of Marines do have video cameras and, you know, photograph these days. And I think most of them spend it on taking pictures of their buddies, taking pictures of the Afghans that they're helping. They use it in a positive way. And, you know, aside from the just absolute devastating, immoral act of urinating on these bodies, you know, the fact that they're videotaping it is completely egregious, and then would post it on YouTube. I mean, it completely sets back the war effort and puts a lot of Marines and service members that are over there right now in absolute danger. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email that we have from Scott: As a former Marine, I could more so understand the mentality of these men, for what they have to see and do on a daily basis. It's impossible for those who are not in their situation to judge their actions. We expect these men to be killers and are aghast when they're affected by what our government has them do. As is evident with the high cases of PTSD, violence changes you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I don't think it's arguable. Violence does change you. Do to circumstances, like that - I mean, can you imagine any circumstances that would justify this? TIMOTHY KUDO : No, I don't think I can. I think that when you're in combat, especially, the lines of right and wrong become even more rigid because you do have the ability to kill people. And it's more important then, than any other time, to know what is acceptable and what is not. And there are plenty of service members who go over there, and they do struggle. It's a very challenging environment, and, you know, about 20 percent of returning service members have PTSD. But that doesn't excuse something like this. TIMOTHY KUDO : And despite the fact what people are going to say, that, you know, it was PTSD and all these kinds of things, it's important to note that this was - there are plenty of service members who go over there and serve honorably and do the right thing, and yet this small group of Marines decided to do something unconscionable. And so I think it's not right to say that, you know, it's something that just happens in war because it doesn't. Almost all the time, it does not happen. It's an isolated extreme case - this is. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we'd get a caller in on the conversation. We'd like to hear from Marines, 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Matthew, Matthew with us from Ann Arbor. MATTHEW : Hello. I am, actually, a former U.S. Marine infantryman stationed at Camp Lejeune. And I was really shocked when I saw the video yesterday when it first broke on LiveLeak, especially since the Marine Corps is only 180,000 people strong. So you tend to recognize a few faces. It's a very difficult thing to watch, especially being a Marine, considering that the integrity is doing the right thing when nobody's looking. And the fact that the Marines, in the very beginning, looked to make sure the coast is clear is what offends me the most as a former Marine. \n\n ###",

You're talking about, in the video, they're looking around... MATTHEW : In the very beginning, yes. They start to look and see - I believe that one of them kind of hesitates a minute and says, wait, and then tells them to go on because he notices that the coast is clear. No one was coming, so they would not be caught urinating on these bodies. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet, then, making sure the video is recorded. MATTHEW : Oh, yes. They must have known the video was rolling. They all seem to look at the camera, and that's when I - like I said, I recognize a face or two. And it tends to really hit you, because you know these people personally because the Marine Corps is not that big, and you tend to run into people that you may have known for a while. MATTHEW : And to see people that you really did not think would do this, do it, especially considering some of them - I, you know, would know from personal experience - are on their first combat deployment, for them to do something like that and to blame post-traumatic stress disorder or something like that would be wrong when it falls entirely on the individual Marines that were there, and their lack of integrity. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Matthew. Appreciate it. MATTHEW : No problem. Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Captain Kudo, did you recognize anybody there? TIMOTHY KUDO : I didn't. But I will say just to kind of add on to what he's saying, you know, we spent in that same area, you know, seven months doing counterinsurgency. I lost five Marines, and yet in 39 seconds, they almost undid every single thing that we'd accomplished there. So it's like the scale of this thing is just staggering when you consider the impact that it's going to have not only on the area, but on the country as a whole. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There's a statement issued by the Taliban, that said the incident was against all international human rights and not the only example of the horrific actions the Americans have done in Afghanistan. Quote: American soldiers are trained to spread horror, and this is one of the examples. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I know, Captain Kudo, you will take exception to what that characterization says. But, as you also say, this is going to bolster their cause. TIMOTHY KUDO : Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I know that the U.S. government was in talks with the Taliban, trying to resolve this. But even beyond the strategic level, you know, the guys on the ground are going to have a much harder time. There's going to be more bombs under their feet. There's going to be more bullets flying by. TIMOTHY KUDO : And I think it's just an incredible detriment to every single thing that we are trying to accomplish there, and it's devastating. I mean, my unit right now, is actually deploying to go back to Afghanistan and - right as this is happening. You know, I know that they're going back to a much more dangerous place, and I'm worried about, you know, what they're going to encounter over there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And should we assume everybody in, well, not only where your unit is going, but everybody in Helmand Province is going to see this video? TIMOTHY KUDO : I think everyone everywhere is, to be honest, the entire Middle East and all of Afghanistan. I mean, right when I left, we had just finished installing cell phone towers. And it's nothing for them to go to a local bazaar, pick up a cheap cell phone, put this video on it and go to shuras throughout the countryside and show villagers what we're doing. And obviously it's not all of us, but they're going to tell them that it's civilians that were dead, and they're going to tell them that this is common, and they're going to have the video to convince these people. So it's devastating. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Captain Timothy Kudo, who's a retired Marine. His unit was in Helmand Province just before the unit that apparently, four members of, took this video of them desecrating the bodies of three men, apparently Taliban, but we don't know that. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, coming to you from NPR News. Let's go next to Bob, and Bob's with us from Minneapolis. BOB : Hello, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. You're on the air. Go ahead, please. BOB : My thought is that - my rank or service was in Vietnam, and I could tell you that I can - it's not that it's acceptable that this happened with these Marines, but it's somewhat understandable, only because of their - if you think about what they go through in terms of their training and their conditioning to go to Iraq, go to Afghanistan, and then being in a combat situation under the threat of death on a daily basis. And then when you have a victory, you know, there are just a certain segment of people that are going to try and celebrate it one way or the other. Not acceptable, not appropriate, but they're living in an entirely different world than the rest of us that are armchair quarterbacking, including the captain, as he sits there today. I think I can understand why some of these things happen. And I think we put these Marines in the place that they are, and we put them in the mindset to do what they did. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Armchair quarterbacking, Captain Kudo? \n\n ###",

We, in no way, ever train them to urinate on dead bodies. And, you know, we make mistakes. Like when I was over there, you know, we killed civilians by accident.  Things happen in war that are terrible to both sides, but you always try to do the right thing. And you know when you're standing there, and you've taken your helmet off and the firefight's over, and you're looking around because you know you're about to do something wrong, that that's not OK. And nobody trains you to do that. So I don't know how that comes into play there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bob, thanks very much for the call. BOB : OK. Thanks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Captain Kudo, can you just give us some idea. In a unit that size - four men we see, obviously another one using the video camera, so five - what rank of Marine would have been in charge of that unit? TIMOTHY KUDO : It probably would have been a sergeant, probably a 22- to 25-year-old sergeant. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And they are part of a, obviously, larger unit? TIMOTHY KUDO : There would be a scout sniper team out of a group, a scout sniper platoon, and they would probably be attached to some of the other companies, roughly three to four companies in a battalion working. They would have been attached there to do a specific sniper mission within a different - within that area. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And scout snipers, do they get extra training? TIMOTHY KUDO : They do.  They're considered somewhat elite, I guess you would say. They get extra training, obviously, marksmanship and also, you know, the ability to, you know, hide themselves, the ability to call for fire, so they're a much more advanced unit. And we also select them out of the general population of Marines, looking for issues such as leadership and maturity to make sure that they can handle operating independently like that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Paul. Paul is with us from Ettrick in Wisconsin. PAUL : Hello? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. You're on the air, Paul. PAUL : Yes. I just - I'm a Marine. I'm repulsed. I remember our training. We were trained not to do these things. And if they're going to claim post-traumatic stress, they've already tarnished the Marine Corps. If they're going to claim PTS, they're doing a disservice to the countless numbers of legitimate cases. These are not Marines. They are cowards. That's my comment. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I could hear the emotion in your voice. This is, obviously, very important to you. Thanks very much for the call. Email from Kathleen(ph) : I have a nephew who served in the Marines in Helmand Province. I pray that he would not do something like this. But I've never been in a war nor seen my buddies blown up in front of me or maybe lost an arm or leg from a bomb. So many of these guys are over there on their second or third trip, I don't think we can know what goes through their minds. We know a lot of them come home with mental problems, and maybe these guys are suffering from PTSD while they are there. Of course, it's a terrible thing to desecrate the dead. But I'm not there, and I don't know what preceded this incident. They should be reprimanded, but nothing more. They are suffering enough. Email from Kathleen(ph) : And let's see if we can go next to - this is Lewis(ph), Lewis with us from Sacramento. LEWIS : Yeah. Hi. I'm horrified, as a vet. I just find it just reprehensible. And my comment to everybody who's trying to understand these idiots is that if the Taliban had peed on our guys, we would not be trying to understand. We would be calling them every name in the book. We would demand that they'd be dishonorably discharged. We would demand that they'd be incarcerated. And for us to do not do that to our own people is just reprehensible. I think those guys should be dishonorably discharged. They do not deserve to be Marines, and there's no excuse, whatsoever, for what they did. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lewis, thanks very much for the call. And, Captain Kudo, I think that's - they won't be Marines for too much longer, I don't think. TIMOTHY KUDO : I mean, one hopes. And I'd like to go back to what the gentleman who called before was saying. You know, there is a pretty significant portion of service members these days that are struggling with PTSD, and we're seeing that, you know, in the veteran population back here in the United States. And that's caused some legal issues at times, but nothing on the scale of this. Which is why it's important to make a distinction between, you know, coming back and struggling with, you know, transitioning back into society and the issues of war and combat and the things that you might have seen. And doing something that's completely immoral and heinous - like what occurred here - they are two very different things. And it's important for, you know, Americans to realize that they're not connected. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Captain Kudo, thanks for your time today. \n\n ###",

But when you're black and a woman, well, it ain't easy. There are people making waves, though, and others giving props where props are due. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : On Sunday, the 14th Annual African-American Film Marketplace will honor black female directors. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Emmy winner Neema Barnette will be featured. And she's with me now. Hi. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : Hi. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So congratulations on that. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : Oh, thank you. I feel humbled and honored to be a part of such a wonderful event. It was like going back home, you know? African-American female directors are very close. We have to be because the journey is not this crystal staircase, but decoding or recording the images are worth it all. So it was a wonderful, wonderful evening. And so many people came out, and we looked at each other's work, and it was just fabulous. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So you won an Emmy as a producer for an afterschool special \"To Be A Man.\" How did you get to that point? And what are your goals from this point forward? I know that's a broad question. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : That's right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I know you have a film coming up. But just give us a little sketch of how, at least, you got to the point of winning that Emmy. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : Well, I won the Emmy - I have two directing Emmys. But the Emmy you're talking about I got for producing. I started in New York. I'm from Harlem - came from Harlem to Hollywood. I started in New York in an organization called Third World Cinema, which was originally started by Ossie Davis and a gentleman by the name of Cliff Frazier. And Julie Dash came out of their Preston homes. Spike was close, but he was downtown. And we had a lot of - Bill Duke, you know, a lot of directors started there. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : And so while I was there working and learning about film, Cliff Frazier was directing an afterschool special - his first directing effort. So he got all of us together, and I was the producer, and I didn't know anything about producing. But I did what I could. And it wound - well, I wound up winning an Emmy for it, and it was very exciting. That was my first. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Which do you like better, producing or directing? Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : I hate producing. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : You have to wrangle the money, wrangle everybody, huh? Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : Well, you know, yeah. I'm a filmmaker. I'm a storyteller, you know? But I respect producers, and I think it's a separate art form. You know, I'd rather take a script to the lab and deal what my actors and deal with cinema and visuals and, you know, all that kind of wonderful things about storytelling. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : But I'll tell you, producing is an art. And this is - I just finished executive producing an independent - totally independent. And it was something else, you know? But we got it done in the Cannes. You know, I've been directing 25 years. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : And so this was the first time I kind of called on favors. And so many people came forth. It was amazing. You know, it's amazing when you make a film that has some kind of social or political landscape behind it, how people will get behind you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Tell me about \"Cuttin Da Mustard.\" Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : Oh, it's my pleasure. \"Cuttin Da Mustard\" is a movie - I'm sure you've heard about the expression. If you can't cut the mustard, you know, get out of the kitchen or whatever. \"Cuttin Da Mustard\" is a movie about illiteracy. Ms. NEEMA BARNETTE (Award-Winning Director) : It's a true story of director-writer Reed McCants who grew up in New York in the Lincoln projects. He was an artist, he drew. He went to the public school system. And then he went to junior college. But he had a very deep, dark secret: He was illiterate. He graduated from community college semi-illiterate. Then he wanted to be an actor. \n\n ###",

We've got two men who have very different takes on the question. Michael Meyers is executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition and Trey Ellis is a novelist and screenwriter. He blogs for the Huffington Post. He's also an assistant professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Film. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi, gentlemen. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : Hi. Professor TREY ELLIS (Assistant Professor, Columbia University Graduate School of Film) : Hi. Hello. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So Trey, on the Huffington Post, you wrote about the noose as a powerful symbol different from the confederate flag. What do you mean? Professor TREY ELLIS (Assistant Professor, Columbia University Graduate School of Film) : I mean it's not just saying we don't like you. It's saying very clearly we'd like to murder you violently. It's a different symbol compared to even having a gun - brandishing a gun or a machete as something that might be construed as - for self defense. The guillotine and the noose are only used to kill someone. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And now you wrote that after hearing about the incident at Columbia University that it could be something that was aimed at you. But you also wrote it was kind of disappointing. What do you mean by that? Professor TREY ELLIS (Assistant Professor, Columbia University Graduate School of Film) : I mean, you know, as a child of the '70s, not the '60s, I missed out on this - the biggest battle that black people ever faced - the Civil Rights Movement. So for a moment there, I felt, wow, it's sort of history had caught up with me and I was going to be thrown in the middle of something and I have to see how I would react. A lot of us in my generation wondered, well, how would I ever reacted back then if I had a chance to be a freedom writer or a Panther or a follower of Malcolm X. I thought that this was my moment. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Michael, you also wrote about this Columbia University incident where a female professor had a noose on her door. You thought, I'd react differently. What would you have done? Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : Look, a small noose on a professor's door led to overblown racial rhetoric and racial history onyx about hate crimes, about poison ivy, which is a play on Columbia University status as an elite university school, a protest sign that said Protest Racist Lynch Rope Provocation. The noose is a racist badge of intimidation directed at, quote, \"the black community,\" not at this one black professor, but at the black community. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : It's a rush to judgment. It's a rush to conclusions ahead of evidence, ahead of facts. They even subjected to rope the noose, the small noose to DNA analysis, put six detectives on it in New York, led to TV appearances by the black professor. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : Look, a rope small enough to be left on a door knob is the right size to be put into the trashcan. And you can call it a hanging of a noose if you want or if you must, but I regard it as trash. It's not worthy of the attention it's given in the media, in the hoopla that encourages copycats. But I want to say one more thing, we don't know who's doing these kinds of things. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : I mean, so-called the Southern Poverty Law Center spokesperson engaged in more racial rhetoric. You know, typically hideous, typically mud butt. It is not anything. We don't know who's doing these things. And if the rush to judgment and if everybody give the impression that at Columbia University, which is not a racist institution, that at Columbia University, you have mobs who were gathering to lynch blacks. That's ridiculous. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Michael, let me go back to Trey. I was - Trey, I was intrigued by your whole statement that you'd - it sounds like you kind of wanted to be thrown into the fire. And what Michael seems to be saying is it's not really fire. It might be a little warm, but it's not really fire. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : It's not even warm. Professor TREY ELLIS (Assistant Professor, Columbia University Graduate School of Film) : I don't necessarily disagree, but I don't think that anyone at Columbia where I teach thought that this - that the statement of the noose represented at all the majority of the citizens, of the students at - on campus. In fact, I've been - I participated in a rally with the film division against racism. And blacks and whites, we came out in force using the incident of the noose, small as it is, as an excuse to come together and talk about what we want to do as a community, as a community of people of color, and not of color together to make the university a better place. Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : You know, you always want to change the subject. You know, symbols of hate do not scare me, and it should not scare the so-called race experts who are professors at Columbia University or teaches college. What it scares me, quite frankly, is that the paternalism underway a Columbia University - blacks, whether they are students or faculty, are regarded as fragile. They're regarded as sensitive, maybe overly sensitive. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, Michael\u2026 Mr. MICHAEL MEYERS (Executive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition) : And leading special protection from symbols and words. Newsflash, we don't need it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Michael\u2026 \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Over the past few years, several news organizations established fact-checkers as impartial arbiters to gauge the accuracy of politicians. The best known is probably PolitiFact, which won a Pulitzer Prize for what was then the St. Petersburg Times. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That column uses a truth-o-meter and labels the biggest howlers with a Pants on Fire. A year ago, the Washington Post inaugurated the Fact Checker, which issues one to four Pinocchios. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Now, some critics question the accuracy and purpose of the fact-checkers themselves for alleged bias or for trying to apply absolute terms like true or false to debatable claims. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you read these fact-checker columns, do you find them useful? Is so, how so? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Go to npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, Robert Redford joins us on the upcoming Sundance Festival and how documentaries changed change. But first: fact-checkers. Among the critics, Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard who joins us here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you. MARK HEMINGWAY : Hey, thanks for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also with us here in the studio, longtime political reporter Glenn Kessler, who now writes the Fact Checker in the Washington Post, and thanks very much for coming in. GLENN KESSLER : You're welcome. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Mark Hemingway, in a piece titled \"Lies, Damned Lies and Fact Checking,\" you concluded that the fact-checker is less often a referee than a fan with a rooting interest. How did you arrive at that? MARK HEMINGWAY : Well, there's a number of reasons why I arrived at that conclusion. One of the facts I pointed out in the piece was that the University of Minnesota School of Public Affairs had actually done a survey of PolitiFact, and they evaluated all 500 statements that PolitiFact had rated from January of 2010 to January of 2011. MARK HEMINGWAY : And they found that of the 98 statements that PolitiFact had rated false, 74 of them were by Republicans. Now, I can think of a number of reasons why you might cite one party over the other more, in terms of, you know, who was telling the truth and who wasn't. But doing that at a rate of three to one strikes me as awfully suspicious, particularly when, if you delve into the specifics of the statements that they cited, there's all kinds of problematic things contained there, whereas they are, you know, like you're mentioned, they're often fact-checking opinions and providing counter-arguments to, you know, stated opinions. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, let's bring Glenn Kessler into the conversation. You did an annual review after your first year as a column, and it turned out - you can't speak for PolitiFact, I don't think, but Fact Checker for the Washington Post, I think the number of comments were just about even. GLENN KESSLER : That's right. We - while I do this, I don't really focus on whether they're Republican or Democrat or what have you. I simply look at the statements. But at the end of the year, I did add it all up, and it was about - exactly half were Republican that - statements I vetted, half were Democratic statements. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the number of Pinocchios per party was just about the same, too. GLENN KESSLER : It was just about the same, as well. I mean, in fact there was a slight higher average Pinocchio for Republicans, which I attributed to the fact that there is a Republican presidential primary going on these days, and there were a few Republican candidates that had very high Pinocchio ratings. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There have been others, including Mark Hemingway, but other stories about fact checkers in the past few weeks that have come to the conclusion that, well, among other things, it's hard to find absolute assertions of facts by politicians, at least enough to fill up the column and that inevitably you're going to wind up checking assertions and opinions and debatable points. GLENN KESSLER : Well, frankly, I try not to do that. I mean, there may be instances where people will say I failed in that endeavor. There's nothing more gratifying than being confronted with a number that some politician says, like Mitt Romney, I created 100,000 jobs, and then trying to break... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Or Barack Obama, to be fair, there's the largest middle-class tax cut in history. GLENN KESSLER : Right, which is another debatable fact. And so in being able to break that down and demonstrate whether that is true or not true. Now, you know, I have this gradation where you get one to four Pinocchios, and you have - or you can get the prized Geppetto checkmark, and, you know, that's a reflection of the fact that there's a gradation there. GLENN KESSLER : You know, there are facts that are vaguely true but are taken out of context, or there are facts that are not very illustrative of the point you're trying to make. And so - and I actually don't make a decision as to whether or not someone is purposely lying. I mean, PolitiFact has its lie of the year. I never really speak about lies or not. I don't try to get to the motivations of people but simply say whether or not what they said was a misstatement. \n\n ###",

MARK HEMINGWAY : Absolutely, and I don't think anybody's against checking the actual fact. It's just that it comes down to, you know, like what you mentioned before, where you have situations where, you know, you have debates that are far too nuanced to say this is, you know, correct or this is incorrect. MARK HEMINGWAY : And it just becomes this thing where, you know, one person's presenting an opinion, but because you have this pseudo-scientific marketing gimmick, where you're saying it's false, or you're assuming someone's intent or, you know, no disrespect to Glenn, you know, the Pinocchio itself does sort of imply lying and intent and other things like that. MARK HEMINGWAY : But the reality is that people like to be told that this is right and this is wrong because it simplifies things for them, and it's a very attractive thing for the reader, and it makes these things very popular. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get some of our callers involved in the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. If you read fact-checker columns, do you find them useful? Our guests again, Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard and Glenn Kessler, who created and writes the Fact Checker column for the Washington Post. And we'll start with Brian(ph), Brian with us from Boise. BRIAN : Yeah, hi, how are you? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, thank you. BRIAN : Good. You know, I just wanted to say that I have always been a big reader of all the fact-checkers, and I really, really strongly support what they do when it comes to precise numbers. And my example of that is I believe it was John Cornyn who said that Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of what they did was abortions. And that was very measurably, you know, incorrect. NEAL CONAN, HOST : John Cornyn, the Republican senator from Texas. BRIAN : Exactly, yeah, and so that's an issue where that really stands out as a value to me. But when I started rethinking the fact-checking model was the PolitiFact Lie of the Year of 2011 about, you know, Republicans voting to end Medicare. And that was an issue where there was so much gray area, and it was so opinion-based that for them to call that the lie of the year as an absolute statement just absolutely shot their credibility with me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Glenn Kessler, I know you've written about this. It was not your lie of the year, as you say you don't use the word lie, for example, but it was among your biggest misstatements of the year. GLENN KESSLER : That's right, that's right. And I think the case of the - you know, what the issue at hand was the Democrats saying that the Republicans were planning to kill Medicare, which they then illustrated with television ads that included literally tossing granny over the cliff. NEAL CONAN, HOST : AARP ad there. GLENN KESSLER : Well, I don't know if it was AARP, but it was one of those organizations. And, you know, when you get down to it, you can have an argument about whether or not what the House Republicans want to do with Medicare was a radical change or not, but it was not killing the program. GLENN KESSLER : And, you know, there were different ways of financing it and different ways of delivering care, but particularly for people over the age of 55 currently, they wouldn't really see a change. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Would it have been more accurate or accurate enough to say kill Medicare as we know it? GLENN KESSLER : Well, again, the word kill is really - I think that was where it gets very problematic. And, you know, so you say end Medicare as we know it, well then again, you start introducing what I call weasel words. Those are, you know, it's simplified political rhetoric, and it's not very factual. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And just a correction, it was Jon Kyl I think who said abortion services were over 90 percent, so forgive us for that. And turning to you, Mark Hemingway, is that a useful conversation to be having? MARK HEMINGWAY : Well, I think this PolitiFact Lie of the Year thing actually is a very useful conversation because it illustrates in a very good way where the fact-checking things can really muck up the debate. MARK HEMINGWAY : Now, for instance I think the president's health care plans thus far have been catastrophically stupid, and I like a lot of what I see about the Ryan plan. That said, I think that PolitiFact was fairly egregious when they pronounced this the Lie of the Year. \n\n ###",

Now, any plan that is going to address those problems is going to alter the problem significantly because Medicare as it is, is the problem. MARK HEMINGWAY : So yes, I mean, yes, Paul Ryan is, you know, maybe killing is too strong and unhelpful, but it's also not helpful to say that he's not changing the fundamental nature of the program either. GLENN KESSLER : Well, and I agree completely with that, and in fact I also rated very poorly some of the ways that Republicans would attack Democrats over Medicare. I mean, the fact of the matter is, as you say, Medicare on its current course is not sustainable. So whatever you're going to do, you're going to have to make changes. GLENN KESSLER : And so to sit there in a vacuum and say, well, this plan is going to kill Medicare or kill it as we know it when frankly no matter what we do, Medicare will have to change, and so that I think is part of thinking as why it was called Lie of the Year. MARK HEMINGWAY : I would also point out that just two years ago, PolitiFact's Lie of the Year was Sarah Palin referring to death panels, which refers to something, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is the part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that deals with Medicare. And they declared that the Lie of the Year. MARK HEMINGWAY : And, you know, personally I think it was obvious that Sarah Palin was indulging in a bit of rhetorical hyperbole, and, you know, I don't recall a lot of people, you know, complaining that, you know, PolitiFact was, you know, fact-checking what was, you know, an obvious bit of rhetoric back then. MARK HEMINGWAY : So, you know, I think it just - it goes both ways, and it's just an example of how these fact-checking organizations can wade into a debate and muck up something that involves a lot of subtle and complex details. I mean, if I want to go into, you know, how the Independent Payment Advisory Board works, you know, we're going to be here all day. MARK HEMINGWAY : And you decide whether that's positive or not, but... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Somebody else's show, if you will. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Madonna - and thanks very much for the call, Brian. Madonna in St. Louis: How can a regular person tell if a fact-checking organization is partisan? They don't publish their financial statements, so we can't see where the money is coming from. Glenn Kessler, you work for the Washington Post. GLENN KESSLER : That's right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And PolitiFact, as far as I know, is a creature, to use a pejorative word, of what used to be the St. Pete's Times, now the Tampa Times. GLENN KESSLER : That's right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I think that's true of most of these organizations. GLENN KESSLER : Right, I mean, you do have organizations on the left and the right, since there's Media Matters, which kind of fact-checks things from the left. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But other people do it from the right, as well. GLENN KESSLER : Exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so in that case, they're openly partisan, but we're talking about the people who describe themselves as nonpartisan fact-checkers.

The campaign season keeps fact-checkers busy, poring over political ads, digging into the soundbites from countless debates and combing through official biographies for inaccuracy and the truth stretched. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All the while, they've got to keep their eyes on the ball, the sitting president who should not get a pass just because his re-nomination is virtually locked up. Critics argue that fact-checkers hide behind a mantle of impartiality while handing out judgments that are anything but impartial. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Glenn Kessler is with us, he writes the Fact Checker for the Washington Post. Also Mark Hemingway is here in Studio 3A. He took the trade to task in a piece he wrote for the Weekly Standard. Let's get another caller on the line, and this is Jim(ph), and Jim's calling from Fort Collins in Colorado. JIM : Yes, hi, thank you for taking my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure. JIM : Prior to the break, I kind of felt like we were getting into too much of an issue with regard to one agency trying to justify their position with regard to what is or is not a fact. And some of that's OK, but I think the bigger picture in my perspective is that given the very partisan rhetoric that we hear today, especially at this particular time of the year, along with the hyperbole from each side, that these fact-checking organizations are at least a place to go to get some kind of a reference point from which further information can be garnered in order to make a more informed decision. JIM : They perform a very good service, in my opinion. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Not to get into the weeds, but might you point to an example, Tim? JIM : Might I point to an example? Well, yeah, I guess some of this health care stuff is important, too. I don't remember an exact example, but the doing away with Medicare and changing Medicare so significantly, for example the Medicare Advantage program. JIM : People that I have talked to say oh, well, they're trying to change Medicare so completely that we get rid of some of our - the benefits that we pay for. And if you look into that more deeply, Medicare Advantage might change but it's certainly not going to go away. And at least that's something that people don't think about too deeply, perhaps. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, Jim, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. JIM : All right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : One of the criticisms, Mark Hemingway, that's been raised is that in fact fact-checkers undermine their own organizations, and elsewhere in the newspaper, aren't those reporters supposed to be checking facts, too? MARK HEMINGWAY : Yeah, and I think this is a big problem here is what we have is the major media outlets have so given themselves over to analysis and other things like that that what happens is that now... NEAL CONAN, HOST : As a result of the changing news business. MARK HEMINGWAY : Yes, as a result of the changing news business, a lot of factors, have so given themselves over to analysis that people read newspapers anymore, and they're like, well, where's the basic information that I want? So then when we get into these complex matters or disputes, along come the fact-checkers to answer these questions because it wasn't resolved in the initial, you know, reporting. MARK HEMINGWAY : So they turn to the fact-checkers, and then the fact-checkers are then providing analysis but then pretending it's the impartial sorting out of what's going on. And so you're creating this feedback loop of just analysis on top of analysis, and people, you know, aren't really getting through the din. MARK HEMINGWAY : Now that said, I think that, you know, fact-checking is - can be done right. You know, Glenn is a very able political reporter, I've been reading him for years, and the best fact-checking is, you know, something that is, you know, just straight-up good reporting that with this pseudo-scientific marketing gimmick tacked on. And so it can be done right. It's just, it's frequently done very poorly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, you know, Glenn, you wrote a piece that said wait a minute, we're not supposed to be replacing journalism, we're complimentary. GLENN KESSLER : That's right, I view it as a supplement, and in fact when I was a political reporter, I was often frustrated that I would be covering the day-to-day statements of the candidates and never really had an opportunity to step back and really examine what the truth was behind that statement. GLENN KESSLER : And what I try to do with these columns is not only focus on a particular statement but also give resources for readers to go do their own research. I provide links to all my documentation, to all the reports that I've looked at to reach my conclusions, and so I view it as in part, you know, an education process for everyone involved. \n\n ###",

MATT : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. MATT : Thanks for taking my call. Well, I am a liberal, green Democrat, whatever, who's kind of coming around to Ron Paul's position on some things. And I don't know if it was Mr. Kessler or one of the other so-called fact-checkers wrote something kind of quibbling with his statement that America was bankrupt and gave it a mostly false or three Pinocchios or whatever. MATT : And I just - and I found it totally unhelpful. It's kind of what you were talking about. You're just quibbling about definitions. I think anybody who is following the economic situation would say that we're in dire trouble, and so to say that - you know, and also Ron Paul's been very clear what he means by bankrupt. MATT : So if you wanted to talk about that, you could look into exactly what he means. He's been talking about it for 30 years. But rather than deal with that, it's just this, sort of, well, bankrupt means, you know, you're in receivership and we're not, so three Pinocchios. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I don't know if that was you, Glenn. GLENN KESSLER : I plead guilty. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And bankrupt, I think the argument, if you use the term bankrupt, you should say what you mean. GLENN KESSLER : Exactly. I mean, that's a very strong term. And the fact of the matter is, you know, U.S. Treasury bonds are the gold standard around the world, and you can say the United States is in economic distress or is headed towards bankruptcy or something like that, but to make a flat declaration that the United States is bankrupt I think is incorrect. GLENN KESSLER : Now, I happen to think that Mark disagrees on this point. I think he criticized that particular column, which, you know, I'm - I get thousands of letters every day from readers loving or hating what I write, and I actually learn a lot from some of those readers who make very thoughtful responses to what I've written, and it informs my thinking. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Tell us a little bit about your process, if you would - and Matt, thanks very much for the call. Do you get assigned a quote or an attribution from an editor? Do you look at debates yourself and say oh, better check into that? Or do you get tips from readers? GLENN KESSLER : No, I don't get assigned anything from an editor. It's all on my own initiative. I scan transcripts. I watch debates. I read speeches, listen to speeches whenever the president makes a speech. I get lots of tips from readers. Occasionally I will be pointed to something by - it's strange how it happens, but a Democrat might say, hey, look at what that Republican said, or a Republican might say God, can you believe what that Democrat said, and I will look into it. MARK HEMINGWAY : I was just going to say that I'm glad this person called on this specific example. Glenn and I were discussing this before we came into the studio because I had written a blog post talking about this specific piece. This is another example I think where fact-checking is just really not unhelpful. MARK HEMINGWAY : I mean, does any American not know what Ron Paul means when he says America's bankrupt? I mean, the national debt has increased $4 trillion, about 40 percent in three years. We have, you know, things like $30 trillion unfunded Medicare liabilities. We have no money. MARK HEMINGWAY : Yes, in the specific sense, there is no extra-national legal court that we can go to and file something, you know, Chapter 11 with the United Nations or something like that. But everyone knows we're out of money, and everyone knows what Ron Paul means, and to go in and sort of nitpick that just isn't helpful to the political dialogue, I think. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Again, an exaggerated metaphor that is of use in the political discourse, a matter of opinion then. MARK HEMINGWAY : Well, yeah, but the other thing is I never say this because, you know, I'm inherently suspicious of politicians; I think all Americans should be. But you also have to give these guys a break. I mean, they're trying to communicate to a mass audience, you know, by talking confidently, which is why they make so many mistakes, which is why they give Glenn plenty of fodder on one hand. MARK HEMINGWAY : But on the other hand, I mean, you know, cut them some slack. I mean, they're trying to push a message here, and every American knows what Ron Paul means when he says America's bankrupt. GLENN KESSLER : Well, and I will say that I do try to make it - you asked about my process, I make a distinction between statements that are made in prepared speeches versus things that might be said off-the-cuff. I mean, I think if someone thought about it, and they decided to put a particular fact in a speech, I'm going to look at that a little more harshly than something that might have been off-the-cuff. \n\n ###",

It's not worth, you know, dinging him for that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Julie(ph), Julie with us from Bowling Green in Ohio. JULIE : Hi, thanks for taking my call. I have a question, and I wanted to follow it up by a brief comment, and then I'll take my response off the air. The - I think it's Mr. Hemingway quoted that PolitiFact and other fact-checkers are heavily skewed towards giving Republicans lies or, you know, lie of the year or whatever. JULIE : And I was wondering if that was just, like, official, or does that include pundits and commentators? Does it include everybody? And then I just wanted to also comment that I think political fact-checkers are very important because up in rural northwest Ohio, you know, most of the people that I'm around, you know, watch a lot of these commentators, and they take what they say as fact. JULIE : And when Michele Bachmann makes comments like, you know, vaccines are dangerous, you know, they don't care about anything but what just came out of Michele Bachmann's mouth, and I think that... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Michele Bachmann was a candidate, is a member of Congress and is a candidate, therefore her statements are perfectly, imminently qualified for review by fact checkers, I think, by their own definition. But pundits, Glenn Kessler, would you review pundits? GLENN KESSLER : You know, I don't do that. I'm just myself and an assistant. PolitiFact has a, you know, vast and growing army of fact checkers around the country because they've partnered with a number of different newspapers. They do take on pundits, you know, and maybe that's an area that's ripe for investigation. But at the moment... NEAL CONAN, HOST : But they're busy elsewhere in the middle of the day. GLENN KESSLER : Right, exactly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Noreen(ph). I don't understand that the - that since - excuse me. I don't understand the idea that since PolitiFact demonstrates that Republicans lie three times as often as Democrats mean it's biased. Maybe Republicans actually do lie that much more. The idea that you have to have an even number of lies reported for Democrats and Republicans in order to be considered not biased is ridiculous. One side could lie way more than the other. And by trying to make them even, you are distorting fact. Is simple numerical balance an indication of nonpartisanship? GLENN KESSLER : No. I don't look at them that way, and, as I said, I don't really keep track of, you know, how many Democrats or how many Republicans I'm looking at until, you know, at the end of the year, I count it up. My own experience from 30 years covering Washington and international diplomacy and that sort of thing is there's - both Democrats and Republicans will twist the truth as they wish if it somehow will further their aims. I mean, no one is pure as a driven snow here. And I've often joked that if I ever write an autobiography, I'm going to title it \"Waiting for People to Lie to Me.\" NEAL CONAN, HOST : That's something reporters do a lot. Mark Hemingway? MARK HEMINGWAY : Why - I think I said when I even brought this up. I mean, you know, I don't think that, you know, that, you know, numerical selection is indicative of, you know, bias per se. I just think that it's highly suspicious. When it's three to one, you know, if it were 60-40, you know, whatever, yeah, sure, you know? But when it's three to one, you start getting things where, you know, you start wondering about, you know, why the selection bias. MARK HEMINGWAY : And then, second of all, the other issue is it's not just that they're choosing, you know, saying Republicans are lying three times more than Democrats, it's the rationales they choose when they say that they're lying. And I've gone through this a number of times where, you know, I'm banging my head against the desk because I read some rationale for some statement they've rated false when it's just clearly unfair. So it's not just that they're selecting it three to one, it's just the rationales that they use when they select it are often really shaky. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Mark Hemingway is the online editor of The Weekly Standard, wrote the piece \"Lies, Damned Lies, and Fact Checkers.\" Glenn Kessler created and writes The Fact Checker column for The Washington Post. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And Jonathan is on the line. Jonathan with us from Lebanon, in New Hampshire. JONATHAN : Hi. This sort of follows up on what your guests just said. Although I do usually read the PolitiFact column that runs in our local paper, the Valley News, I usually don't find it all that helpful because, you know, just like the guest said, I sort of expect that politicians, especially in a very, you know, rough race, will exaggerate greatly and throw in a few, you know, complete just untruths. You know, I'm not totally cynical about politics. I believe, you know, I think that the political system is still, you know, working more or less, but I'm cynical enough to not trust, you know, the things that the politicians are saying. And I, you know, I tend to rely on my other reading to have some sense of whether or not what they say is true or not to begin with. So that, for me, the fact checking is only moderately useful. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It sounds like a sensible approach. Can you tell us, did you vote today? JONATHAN : No. I actually - I'm calling from Lebanon, New Hampshire, but I live right across the border in Vermont. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, not eligible. JONATHAN : Not eligible, exactly. \n\n ###",

Two years after the earthquake, the number of displaced residents in the tent towns is down by two-thirds, but that still leaves half a million people in often squalid circumstances. More than half of the 10 million tons of rubble has been removed from the streets, but only a little more than half. A less ambiguous improvement: More people have access to clean water now than before the disaster. Even so, hundreds of Haitians contract cholera every day, though a new vaccination project could reduce fatalities.

Go to npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Rajiv Shah is administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development. He joined us a year ago to talk about distribution of relief aid. He's joined us again today here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you back with us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : DR. RAJIV SHAH: Thank you. It's nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what worked, and what hasn't? SHAH : Well, you know, it is always important to note that on this anniversary of an incredibly tragic event, that more than 250,000 people lost their lives. And the challenge that that has posed for a country that had difficulties to begin with are really extraordinary. But in the context of that, over the last two years, we've seen real signs of hope. A number of things have worked. Partners and the Haitian government and Haitian leaders have done things differently so that today, as you point out, more people have access to clean water and safe sanitation in Port-au-Prince than the day before the earthquake. SHAH : Health services are broadly available to a broad range of the population. A quarter of a million kids are now back in school and getting an effective education. And importantly, the economy is actually on the move - 5.6 percent GDP growth. And we've seen real areas of hope in areas like the banking and mobile money system, as well as in agriculture and food security, which continues to be where 60 percent of Haitians are employed. So there are challenges. This is tough. This is a long-term program of leadership for the Haitians and for their partners. But we have seen important concrete results that give us hope for the future. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I'm sure we'll have many questions about the challenges. I did want to ask you, though, about one of the projects that does seem to be succeeding. You wrote an op-ed in the Miami Herald, which we just took a look at, and there is a project to help farmers in Haiti - 60 percent of the workforce in Haiti are famers - to increase their yields, particularly of rice. SHAH : Absolutely. You know, Haitians have been importing rice and buying imported grains, like rice and wheat and other products, when they have the potential to have a very vibrant economy in the agriculture sector. We've seen a specific partnership between the University of Florida and the people and farmers of Haiti result in their getting access to better technologies in areas like corn or maize, where we've seen more than 300 percent improvements in yield. SHAH : In rice, they're using a system called the system of rice intensification, which allows them to use less water, less fertilizer, more safe inputs. And they're seeing a big increase, doubling or tripling of yields, and a 75 percent increase in farm incomes because of that program, which has now reached almost 10,000 farm households, and we believe will reach 125,000 over time. So those are the types of concrete results that will help Haiti develop a stronger economy, reduce poverty and reduce the kind of chronic hunger and malnutrition that has held back so many Haitian children unfairly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The United States is the largest donor to Haiti, yet there are many others, and there are commitments, I think, through 2020. But I wanted to read you this quote: \"It is not realistic to expect the international community to continue to direct foreign assistance money indefinitely toward this country, as it has for so many years.\" The source is U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten. It seems some people are beginning to lose some patience. SHAH : Well, Ken has been a - Ambassador Merten has been a stalwart supporter of Haiti and the Haitian people and has fought through very difficult circumstances to do that. President Obama and Secretary Clinton have made clear that we will have a long-term and firm commitment to the people of Haiti. We did before the earthquake. We did in the tremendous relief effort immediately following the earthquake that saved tens of thousands of lives, and we will continue to in the future. But what is true is that we need to do things differently. We have to invest in Haitian institutions, work with Haitian partners so that they can lead their own country's future and they can develop strong government institutions, strong NGOs, strong private companies. SHAH : And we're starting to see that. We saw Marriott and Digicel make an announcement about a major new hotel investment in Port-au-Prince. We see that we're working today, USAID is working with 500 Haitian organizations after a real intensive effort to go out there and meet these groups and make sure we work directly with them, so that they develop the capabilities and capacity to rebuild their own country and to do it to a higher level of excellence than had been done previously. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You talk about Haitian partners, and a lot of those are NGOs. It's fair to describe the government as having itself been shattered by the earthquake. There has been an election, the presidential election, since. There is a new president. Yet, we still read descriptions of the Haitian government as dysfunctional. SHAH : Well, it's important to put this in context and understand the progress they've made. President Martelly was elected, and then there was a peaceful transition of power in a democratic circumstance with the partnership of the international community. That was an important achievement. President Martelly then went on to build his Cabinet and fill out his government, which has taken some time but is now complete. And the Haitian institutions, ministries are taking leadership of their own future. SHAH : So the Ministry of Health has designed a health plan that the United States and a number of other international partners are now lining up behind in trying to help them implement. The Haitian Ministry of Education have been implementing President Martelly's commitment to get every Haitian child into schools. And we're working with them to help them set standards and meet some of the innovators in American education so that we can learn from each other as we go forward. SHAH : That's the kind of leadership we want to see from our Haitian partners, and we are ready to be good partners behind their leadership because, ultimately, it's those actions that will create the conditions where aid is no longer needed in the future. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Rajiv Shah is the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, joining us, again, a year anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti that devastated the capital, Port-au-Prince, and, as he mentioned, killed so many people and left millions homeless. 800-989-8255. If you've been to Haiti over the past year, what is the priority now? Or you can email us: talk@npr.org. Let's start with Mario. Mario with us from West Palm Beach in Florida. MARIO : The priority would be to create structures. Haiti doesn't even have a capitol after two years after the earthquake. And there is no movement to our structural capital with modern buildings. There's no movement of that. If you go to Haiti today, it's like the earthquake just happened. But people are talking about progress that they are making, and we have a lot of people under the tents still after two years. And I just came from Haiti. I'm asking myself, where that money has gone? Because I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The presidential palace, as Mario referenced... MARIO : Still a mess. \n\n ###",

That's exactly right, Rajiv Shah. SHAH : Well, it is. It is important to note that the Haitian leadership has put forth their own development plan. And their priorities have included education, have included energy, agriculture, rebuilding their economy and providing health and education services to their people. And they prioritized that over some other potential investments like the reconstruction of that particular palace. But it is important to note, I was in Haiti recently, and you see - visit the camps and, of course, there are still 500,000 people in that setting. SHAH : In that environment, it's hard to recognize, but it's important to note that there used to be 1.5 million in that neighborhood. And we moved - in partnership with the Haitians, moved those people into appropriate housing, often by reconstructing homes that had been damaged and reconstructing them to a higher level of earthquake protection than before. SHAH : In many cases, there are major new home construction sites, like the 1,500 homes that are going in in the north around this major new industrial park that's an investment with the South Korean textile manufacturer that will initially create 20,000 jobs that might, over time, create 60 or 65,000 jobs. Those are the kinds of large-scale transformational programs and results that will help Haiti become a vibrant, self-sustaining economy over time. SHAH : And, you know, I applaud the Haitian government for making some tough choices in terms of setting priorities. I know this is going to be a long road ahead, but we have reason to be optimistic, and we have to be vigilant about tracking where the money is going to making - so that we make sure we deliver more of these results. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You trumpet it and for good cause. There are more people getting clean water today in Port-au-Prince than they were the day before the earthquake. I'm sure that's correct, and I'm sure that's very important. Nevertheless, cholera, a disease that is spread and caused by poor sanitation and dirty water, 300 people a day come in with new cases of cholera. This is an improvement too. That's down from 500 a day. This was brought in by the United Nations, troops. Everybody believes, and this is a cause of great resentment. SHAH : Well, the cholera outbreak was an extraordinary setback to a country that was just trying to climb out and recover from a tremendous tragedy to begin with. The initial case fatality rate was more than 9 percent, and that's incredibly high, and that means we lost far more children than ever should've been the case. The United States, working through the Centers for Disease Control and other partners, really sent our best, most capable disease control experts to Haiti to help, work with them, to bring down that case - fatality rate. The global goal went - in cholera epidemics is about 1 percent. Today, that case fatality rate is 0.56 percent. And so, the goal is to really save as many lives as is possible and to try to keep cholera under control, and that has largely been achieved. We have to keep at it and keep focused at it. And, hopefully, there'll be some new tools like vaccines and other strategies that can help eliminate the problem all together in the near future. NEAL CONAN, HOST : USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Megan(ph), Megan with us from Stillwater, Minnesota. MEGAN : Yeah. Hi. I was in Haiti recently with the Tallahassee Haiti Medical Organization, and I just think, in general, that Haitians need basic access to health care. There's such an inequity in health care there and just lack of clean water. And, I mean, we gave out 650 bars of soap in three days of (unintelligible) because the people just lack the basic necessities like that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And one of the problems there, Rajiv Shah, as you know well, has been the lack of facilities to train health care professionals in Haiti, including doctors. Has there been progress there? SHAH : There has, but I'm so glad the caller mentioned the distribution of soap and efforts to really promote basic sanitation practices to prevent disease in the first place. That's an area where we've seen a lot of progress compared to pre-earthquake statistics. There's also a challenge about building a vibrant and integrated health system. You know, for too long, Haitian NGOs and international NGOs, as well-meaning as they were, would go out and try and solve one disease or provide services in one area somewhat disconnected from each other. SHAH : In the reconstruction, they decided to do things differently, and the Haitian government put forth a single plan for an integrated health system. We are working with them and other partners to make sure there's a reference hospital system so that clinics can be connected to reference hospitals so that if people need a higher level of care, they can be send back to that high level of care. And we're building out the university hospital in the center of Port-au-Prince that can also serve as a training site to address some of the human resource shortages and needs. SHAH : Please keep in mind, before the earthquake, the level of chronic child malnutrition was almost 50 percent in Haiti, and so that's a basic health indicator that demonstrates that conditions were very bad. I think we've seen that number come down significantly recently, and we'll expect to continue to see progress as we continue to expand vaccinations, access to basic maternal health and access to basic child health services throughout the country. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Megan, I'm sorry. I heard you trying to get back in. I think she has left us. I apologize. Anyway, as you look ahead, the question about wastage of funds, have you been able to account for all of the money that the United States has sent into Haiti and make sure that it has gone to useful causes? SHAH : Well, the United States has spent in the immediate humanitarian aid, in the first few months after the earthquake, nearly $1.3 billion in an effort to do everything from health and education, protection, and you remember those urban search and rescue teams that were out there saving lives. At that point in time, the goal is to spend the money very, very quickly and save as many lives as is possible. Since then, the United States has committed an additional $1.8 billion. And the goal of the reconstruction resources are to make sure the  money is spent effectively to do the extra hard work to invest in local Haitian institutions so that they can build up their own institutions. And there's an exit strategy over time for donors and partners. SHAH : And in that context, people sometimes note that, well, not all the money has been spent. Only about 44 percent of that has been spent. But that's actually the - that's the consequence of taking extra measures to make sure that we're safeguarding and protecting resources, taking extra time to work with local entities and local organizations, spending the time coordinating with other donors so that things are not haphazard and uncoordinated, and then measuring concrete results, which is why we can quote to you today the yield performance in the rice project or the percentage of children that are getting vaccinated. Those things take extra time and effort, but it's worth taking that time in order to get it right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get Maurice(ph) on the line from St. Louis. Maurice, we just have a few seconds. MAURICE : Yes. Basically, I wanted to talk about how Haiti, I think, should have a plan as far as agriculture and biomass for electricity production. I'm a graduate student in sustainability, and I've actually come across some USAID documents where USAID has provided funding for creosote projects so people can use less charcoal and in turn, you know, reduce the need for charcoal in Haiti. But I think one of the main problems to - for my main point is that... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Very quickly, please. \n\n ###",

I'm Farai Chideya. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : House Democrats didn't get enough votes to override the president's veto of a Children's Health Insurance Program, and the question of race and intelligence hits the headlines again. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we have got Marcus Mabry, the international business editor for The New York Times; Katy Reckdahl, a contributing reporter to the New Orleans Times-Picayune; and ABC correspondent Ron Claiborne. Thanks for joining us, guys. Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : Thanks for having us. Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So a quick tour on this congressional vote. Democrats voted to expand the program known as SCHIP - it's the State Children's Health Insurance Program - to 10 more children. The president vetoed that bill earlier this month on the grounds it would add people to the federal rolls who could afford private insurance. The House tried to override the veto, and they failed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Marcus, how is the media covering this: as a heartless president, feckless Democrats, both or neither? Mr. MABREY : Well, you know, usually the media, especially the Washington Press Corps, I think, covers things as winners and losers, and I think the media mostly, for the most part, is covering this story - the \"mainstream,\" quote, unquote, media - as an example of the continuing Democratic political impotence. Mr. MABREY : They are the losers here, even though they control both houses of Congress, it's the President Bush who's emerged victorious. And that's been happening an awful a lot lately for a president who is in the depths of unpopularity, but, of course, the only people more unpopular than him is the Congress. And he's actually exploiting that so far to deaf political effect. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So, Katy, again this is something - 10 million more children could've been added to the rolls - at least potentially. Is this an issue that America cares enough about to keep it in the headlines? Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : Well, I can speak for New Orleans. People in New Orleans care about this in a very large way. We have such a high rate of uninsured people here because it's a working poor economy that depends on the tourist industry largely here in New Orleans. Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : We have so many working, poor, uninsured people, and yet the state of Louisiana - its program called LACHIP, which is the version of SCHIP here - has really outdone itself in enrolling uninsured kids. It had - we have 8 percent uninsured - at least before the storm - compared to a national average of 11 percent. Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : Louisiana just never out-performs any other state, and we are enrolling kids in health insurance. And that's because state officials have found it to be more effective, more cost-effective actually to enroll kids in Medicaid and get that federal money into here to pay for health care in New Orleans. The recovery of New Orleans really depends on being able to have those kids go to doctors. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ron, this SCHIP expansion would've gotten its funds from the cigarette tax hike increase to a dollar a pack from 39 cents. What about that issue -somewhat separate and aside? Does America have the willingness to increase cigarette taxes which, according to some studies, have been shown to decrease youth smoking? Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : Apparently not. It does seem strange. I think Americans have a philosophical problem, or at least many do, with tax increases, but one would think that a tax on cigarettes, with all of its destructive qualities, would have support among the American public. And by the way, I should note that when you look at polls on the SCHIP program, the overwhelming majority of Americans, including Republicans, favor in expanding that programs. So while the president has won a victory, I'm not so sure the Republicans in the long run won a victory here. My understanding is that there are quite a few Republicans in Congress who are worried about the repercussions for them and their party by not getting this passed. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Marcus. Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : I think Ron is exactly right. I think this will be in issue in 2008. And so far, the Democrats are actually threatening to send this bill, to tweak with it, and then send it, once again, to the president. And if he chooses to veto it again, they're threatening to wait until right before the 2008 presidential elections so that for the third time, which, of course, you know, I think this is again the political dilemma that Democrats find themselves in. If they were to do that then, of course, the White House would say, oh, they're playing politics. Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : Exactly. The issue now for the Democrats, I would think, is do you compromise and get something passed or make an issue of this and dig in. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just something else that connects to this in a way - you're talking about the Republicans and the Democrats: A lot of Republican lawmakers in Congress are saying that they are going to step down, end their terms, or are vulnerable. Could this add to that mix? Katy or Ron - whoever. Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : Yeah, I think it could add to that mix. \n\n ###",

Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : But I also feel like one of the issues that people - that the Republicans and opponents of this bill - it seems like when I talk to people around here, there's a misunderstanding about Medicaid in general, and there's an exploiting of that. In Louisiana, adults don't - most adults don't qualify for traditional Medicaid, and I think that there is a confusion about that in the general public. And as a result, I think that that makes this issue hard to define for an electorate. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ron, I actually want to ask you a different question on politics. He is the first black governor of Massachusetts, and he wants to paint the White House black, or at least help Barack Obama take over the Oval Office. That's Governor Deval Patrick endorsing Senator Obama this week. Now he was President Bill Clinton's assistant attorney general for civil rights. So is this a surprise or even a betrayal? Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : I don't know if it's a betrayal. I guess the really salient question is, is this going to make any difference? Barack Obama is - is struggling right now, and with or without Deval Patrick's endorsement, he's got a tough road ahead. I'm not sure Deval Patrick will swing many votes, maybe outside of Massachusetts and Massachusetts votes, I believe, in the first week in March. But one way or the other, I think this nomination will be settled before Massachusetts votes. And right now, it looks like Hillary Clinton. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Marcus, how important is this, if at all? Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : Well, you know, I think it's important for the atmospherics in as we see African-Americans coming out for Barack Obama from Deval Patrick to, of course, Oprah Winfrey. I think that - what the Obama campaign hopes is that it will at least increase the African-American enthusiasm for his candidacy so that black people will support him overwhelmingly in the primaries, which is what, of course, he needs. But Ron's right. And right now, it's - he's been one of the greatest disappointments so far in this long run toward the White House for '08. He is not capitalizing on his early popularity or enthusiasm. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Katy, what do you think about his long-term prospects? Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : You know, people really like Barack Obama, but I think there's an - I think there is a practical sensibility that maybe Hillary Clinton is the horse to run with in the long run here. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Another bit of news. James Watson used to be famous as the co-discoverer of the double helix DNA. He's currently notorious for his comments that black intelligence is not equal to whites. His comments in the London Sunday Times magazine set off a firestorm of controversy. Now, the 79-year-old Nobel Prize-winning scientist has apologized, claiming that his remarks were misunderstood. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Katy, is this story playing big in the U.S.? It's been huge in the U.K. Ms. KATY RECKDAHL (Reporter, The Times-Picayune) : You know, it really hasn't - as far as I can tell, I haven't - I barely heard about it. It's one of those things that you'd think would get bigger press here. It's just - that's just been a blip on the radar screen. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Ron, Watson was due to speak at London Science Museum, but they cancelled his speech because they said he has gone beyond the point of acceptable debate. As journalists, we debate a lot of things. When you make a decision, for example, about covering a story like this, do you look at this whole question of acceptable debate, whether or not it's news or whether or not it's something that should pass? Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : well, you know, in this case, I'm not sure what the news value as news is in this gentleman's comments. I mean, they're pretty outrageous. You mentioned that he says that blacks weren't as intelligent as whites, but he went well beyond that, as I recall, and has made some pretty incendiary comments in the past. I'm not advocating censoring anyone but I'm, you know, you have to be careful when you give a platform on this subject to someone espousing these kinds of views, which are pretty far out. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Marcus, there's been a lot of debate in this country over race and intelligence, and it's played out in different ways. I think the biggest case most recently \u2014 and it wasn't that recent - was Charles Murray in \"The Bell Curve\" talking about affirmative action and aptitude. These comments may be really out of the ballpark in terms of the credibility, but what about the larger debates that they inspire and undercurrents in American society in discussing these issues? Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : Well, you know, I think it's important to get them out there. I think, you know, this is not just some crackpot. This is, you know, Watson, of the famous pair Watson and Crick, and maybe it has not gotten more attention in the U.S. because most of us don't know who they are. But as you said, Farai, this is the pair that discovered the basic makeup - how DNA, what DNA is, and how it works - of all living things. This is, you know, when it comes to genetics, these guys are the biggest. They are the Einsteins of genetics. There's no one bigger. Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : And so the fact that he would say this and that - and would have these abhorrent views is important. I think it actually brings to light and brings to the fore something that, I think, many Americans, as well as Brits and people all over the world, I think, many white people, and I think, unfortunately, many African-American and other black peoples as well, this sense that they have that we are, somehow, as a people, less intelligent. Mr. MARCUS MABRY (International Business Editor, The New York Times) : And this is something that I think is unspoken in our schools, in our classrooms, in our universities, and it makes a great difference, I think, in the expectations placed on black children at the earliest levels. And I think it has a self-fulfilling prophecy, and we need to talk about it. We cannot ignore this because we ignore it at our peril because this frame of mind is operating every day in our lives, and it is having a deleterious effect. Mr. RON CLAIBORNE (Reporter, ABC News) : Did Watson make these comments into context of his scientific background or his personal feelings or beliefs or conclusions he's reached? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, he's looking, not only from a scientific background from - but also from this idea of how much have people of African descent achieved. We've only got a little time. What do you think about that, Ron? \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Have you heard of the Western Sahara? It's one of the least populated areas in the world. And for decades, this tiny piece of land has been at the center of a tug-of-war. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : For more, we've got Bill Flether, a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies and former president of the TransAfrica Forum. Hi, Bill. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : Glad to be back. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Yeah. Good to see you in person. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : Thank you. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And we don't hear much about Western Sahara. Most of the people there are both Arabic and Spanish? Why? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : It's that they say speak Arabic and Spanish. They are largely nomadic. And in the 1880s, Spanish - it's part of the division of Africa, grabbed this section of North Africa and held it until 1975. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : And its neighbor, Morocco, is a francophone country. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : Precisely. And Morocco has always laid claim to the Western Sahara, and whereas moratoria(ph) to the South gave up that territory, the Moroccans have insisted on keeping control. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What has that produce in terms of conflict? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : War. The war actually began in the early 1970s when the Spanish were still there. When the Spanish withdrew the Sahrawi people carried out a war against both the Moroccans and the Mauritanians. They signed a peace with the Mauritanians, and the Moroccans refused to give up. And, in fact, at a certain point, in 1975, King Hassan II sent 350,000 Moroccan civilians into the Western Sahara in order to settle the territory. So the war continued up until 1991 when there was a ceasefire. It's not been resolved. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, what role has the U.S. played in trying to mediate this or taking sides? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : A little bit of both. In the beginning, because Morocco was a very close Cold War ally of the United States, the United States sided with Morocco in grabbing this land. Then, in the 1990s, former Secretary of State James Baker was appointed by the United Nations to be a special envoy to try to mediate the solution to the crisis and spent several years doing this, resigned in frustration when the Moroccans kept breaking the agreements. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : Most recently, however, there's been an ominous cloud, which is that the Moroccans have said that Western Sahara should be an autonomous province, and there are a growing number of people in Congress that are saying, yes, that's right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now who's going to negotiate this, if anyone? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : This really - this needs to continue to be conducted through the United Nations. There really is no other broker that, I think, can do this, although pressure from the African Union certainly could help if it was a move against the Moroccans. The problem that we face, though, is that if there is a developing poll of opinion in - on Capitol Hill that's supporting the Moroccan position, the Moroccans may feel that they have no reason to compromise, thus, war will continue. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What stake does the U.S. have either in Morocco or the Western Sahara in that region period? Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : There is economic, political and strategic: economically, phosphates which were discovered in large quantities in the early 1960s in the Western Sahara; political, Morocco has been a close ally - some would call it a puppet of the United States for years. So that's the second factor. Mr. BILL FLETCHER (Former President, TransAfrica Forum; Senior Scholar, Institute for Policy Studies) : The third thing has to be situated in this so-called war against terrorism where anywhere in the Arabic-speaking world, there is this complete paranoia within the United States that al-Qaida may surface. And what's happening is the Moroccans are trying to disparage the liberation forces in West Sahara, calling them terrorists. \n\n ###",

He grew up in the colored townships. And in South Africa, colored was distinct from black. That's where he learned to trust his talent. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : This is where the family would see who's the real singer or not. And you'd sit by the fire and when you throw your voice, everybody goes okay. I think you can make it. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Butler documents his trip back with a new CD and DVD, \"Live in South Africa.\" Recently, Jonathan Butler got by our NPR studios with his guitar. We started out talking about how he became the first non-white person played on white South African radio. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : Well, I was 12 years old. I was - I just got signed to independent label called, Jive, which was independent back then. It was a kind of different time. You know, I mean, I was doing cabaret and I was singing in carnivals, ballet choirs. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : So wait, you're 12 years old and you've - it sounds like you were already an experienced showman. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : I was - well, I grew up in the family of 12, you know, siblings who all, were out there doing concerts, cabaret shows, working in night clubs, traveling, you know? And their stories always fascinated me when they came from their travels. They talk about so many things that seem, and they'd sort of - the stuff they would bring home. And music was obviously our world, you know? And I just love that. I just wanted to sing and - but I was the kind of kid that would openly sing right off the bat. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : From the time I was 6 years old, I was in community concerts. My parents always had their own variety shows, and then I started winning competitions in carnival and stuff like that, and I started working with local bands because they love my voice and we did R&B stuff, you know, from America, we did pop stuff from U.K. A lot of Top 40, you know? Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : But my journey really began when I won a huge contest in South Africa in Cape Town. And that took me away from my parents. And I remember being sort of, pretty scared, basically, because I was a 6-year-old kid, 7-year-old kid living - now, I had my own bedroom. I, you know, I used to, my, our shanty house, our shack was pretty much - all the brothers lived in one room and all the sisters having one room and mom and dad had twin beds. And so, for me, to have my own room is pretty amazing. That kind of, you know, scared the living daylights out of me. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : And having to learn to learn with a knife and fork, and, you know, through all of that travels, and leaving my home, my parents, by the time I was 12, I got discovered by Clive Calder who now, who used to own Jive records and Ralph Simon. And they said would you want to, you know, we'd love to make a record with you. And of course, that was all I ever wanted, was to be heard on radio because Stevie Wonder was my hero in life and Michael Jackson when he was still a cute Michael Jackson because, you know, people like Billy are just adored on radio. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : So my parents said, yeah, and I made my first record. It was a song called \"Please Stay,\" you know, it was like (unintelligible). And it was something like this. It went\u2026 Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : (Soundbite of song, \"Please Stay\")\" Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : (Singing) If I got on my knees and pleaded with you not to go but to stay in my arms. Something like that. Will you walk out the door like you did once before? This time - like that - will be different. Please Stay. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : Something like that, you know? But I mean, it was 10 keys higher at the time. But that song was\u2026 FARAI CHIDEYA, host : A big song for a young man. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : What did I know about love? I had - knew nothing about love. You know, I was 12 years old. But the song became a national hit song. And, you know, it was the first time that I experienced in South Africa that kind of notoriety and popularity and fame. And I still lived in a shack, you know, an outhouse, and all that stuff, no electricity. You know, a lot of things did not change even though I was probably the country's most popular artist from that time. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : And I later discovered what that - the gratification so - what that, you know, what that presented, that I was the first black kid to be played on white radio. I mean, South Africa was very different. It was very different, very different then. I mean, I won the Grammy, but my picture wasn't in the paper. You know, the white lady presented me the award, kissed me, you know, the night of the award. They never showed the pictures. They just said, you know, the youngest black kid to ever win a South African Grammy. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : And so I had no idea what socially, politically what that meant, you know? And I just kept going because music was my breath, it was my life, it was my salvation. But now, we have a different kind of warfare that we have to fight, which is HIV/AIDS in South Africa. And we have to deal with poverty in South Africa. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : I do ask myself the question what is going on in government and in power. So it just tells me that it takes leadership. When you say you're going to run, you know, for president or you say you're going to run for, you're going to start a foundation, you know, to help the poor, it takes incredible amount of leadership, not just vision, because we still, you know, I mean, my heart still breaks when I get off the plane and I drive from the airport to the hotel, you know? And I see more shanties now that I've ever seen. Mr. JONATHAN BUTLER (Singer) : Now, having said that, I'm excited to walk down the streets a free man in South Africa. I remember as a kid, seeing white signs, black signs, colored signs all over the place, you know? The Rosa Parks stories were endless in South Africa. None of them were heard. None of them were spoken off, you know? And so, I can say, it takes incredible amount of leadership. It's going to take incredible amount of leadership. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Well, I know that a lot of people had been inspired by your music. And I want to end with one of your breakthrough songs, breakthrough gospel songs. Will you take us out with \"Falling in love with Jesus?\" \n\n ###",

Ethiopia last invaded Somalia in 2006 and withdrew three years later. Shabab's lost both territory and popular support in Somalia, but analysts describe Somalia's transitional federal government as weak, incompetent and corrupt. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So what, if anything, should the U.S. and the West do now? Jeffrey Gettleman, East Africa bureau chief of The New York Times, joins us from his home in Nairobi. Nice to have you back. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Glad to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And joining us here in Studio 3A is Bronwyn Bruton, a deputy director at the Atlantic Center(ph), where she focuses on East Africa policy. And thanks very much for coming in. BRONWYN BRUTON : Absolutely. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeffrey Gettleman, let's start with you. Ethiopia left Somalia two and a half years ago after significant casualties and very little to show for their efforts. What's different now? JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Not a whole lot, actually. There's momentum in the region to get rid of Shabab, and Ethiopia seems to be piling on. The Kenyans came into Somalia a few months ago. The African Union has been making some progress in Mogadishu, the capital. So I think the Ethiopians felt that this was a good opportunity to finish the Shabab once and for all. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And if they get to the Port of Beledweyne, will they largely succeed? JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Well, here's what a lot of us are worried about. The Shabab may be defeated as a conventional force. They may no longer be able to administer territory, but they're probably going to go underground and re-emerge as something like al-Qaida in East Africa and focus purely on terrorism and probably outside of Somalia. So they could become even more dangerous if they're vanquished on the battlefield. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's bring Bronwyn Bruton into the conversation. It's interesting to remember, the force in Somalia when the Ethiopians invaded the first time with the Islamic Courts Union, they morphed into Shabab, which, well, Shabab will say drove the Ethiopians out. BRONWYN BRUTON : They did, and I think that this really highlights the challenge that's facing the U.S. right now. The problem with al-Shabab is that, you know, they're the result of too much meddling by the external community, to a certain degree. The Shabab would not exist today if it hadn't been for the overassertive - brutal, in fact, efforts of the Ethiopian government, and they were backed by the U.S. BRONWYN BRUTON : And the risk that Jeff just pointed out as well is basically that by being too assertive now in combating the Shabab, you know, by decimating them, by forcing them to go underground, the U.S. could actually make them into a more dangerous entity than they currently are. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet by forcing them to go underground before these interventions, they had the transitional government bottled up to a couple of blocks in Mogadishu. They were controlling vast areas of territory in the midst of a famine. They were not letting resources - food, medicine - into those areas. They were also providing training grounds for other terrorists. BRONWYN BRUTON : It's true, and it's a really upsetting development. And it's particularly upsetting, I think, when we stop and consider the fact that the creation of al-Shabab owes so much to U.S. counter-terror policies. It puts us in a tough position now to say, well, on the one hand, we want to be helpful. On the other hand, the U.S.'s response to the Shabab's rise has not been to say, well, we need to really flood Somalia with humanitarian relief. We need to correct this imbalance that we've caused by making sure the Somali people are OK. BRONWYN BRUTON : On the contrary, the U.S. pretty much stopped food relief to Somalia, starting in 2009. So, you know, the best thing that the U.S. can do, I think, is to really make sure that we take care of the Somali people. The Shabab, it's easy to see them as the result of the terrorist ideology, but we have to remember 90 percent of them are children. They're the youth. That's what the Shabab means. They're under the age of 20 years old. They've been misled. You know, they're desperate kids who have no future. And that's what the Somalis see in al-Shabab. BRONWYN BRUTON : You know, they hate the leaders who have corrupted their kids, and it's very much in the U.S. interest to knock those leaders out. They're doing that, hopefully, carefully with these drones and by targeted attacks. But at the bottom of it, the Shabaab is the result of the fact that the Somalis are poor, desperate and futureless. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeffrey Gettleman, from your vantage point there in Nairobi, is that an accurate description of the situation with Shabaab in Somalia? JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Yeah, more or less. I mean, I think a lot of people resent not just the leaders, but the rank-and-file fighters who have been terrorizing them. But I think what's important to remember is even if the Shabaab are defeated, stability in Somalia is not around the corner. There - already we're seeing the emergence of warlords or the return of warlords. There are still parts of the country that are pirate sanctuaries, and the transitional government has, you know, continually embarrassed itself in many ways. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : So this isn't the, you know, the end of Somalia's troubles if the Shabaab are defeated. And I think what is troubling is that we're not seeing a lot of talk of what to do next after the Shabaab are gone, if they are gone, and you're going to have more armies meddling in Somalia and present in Somalia than you have had for a long time right at the moment when they're trying to form a new government. So that may not go over so well either. NEAL CONAN, HOST : More armies in addition to Kenya and Ethiopia? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Yeah, you have Ugandans there. You have Burundians there. You have the Djiboutians there, the American government. The French government have, you know, special operations in Somalia. So you have this - and the mandate of the transitional government expires in August, and at that point, everybody's going to have to sit down and figure out what to do with a government for Somalia. And at that point, you're going to have all these different players at the table who have their own local favorites and proxy forces. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : And Bronwyn has written a lot about this, but there's this belief that the only way for Somalia to be stable is it to happen from within a grassroots, local governance, bottom-up approach. And we're just not seeing that, so I'm afraid that the - a lot of the problems of famine and underdevelopment and piracy are going to continue unless there's some serious progress made in governance. And we're just - nobody's really talking about that. It's a military story right now, and that's never been the solution. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bronwyn Bruton, you wrote about outside interference from Ethiopia, yes, and supported by the United States, Kenya now and, indeed, the description of the African Union forces there by Jeffrey Gettleman in The New York Times. Outside forces also included al-Qaida. BRONWYN BRUTON : They did. Although back in 2006 when Ethiopia invaded Somalia, I think that the threat from al-Qaida was greatly exaggerated, and the influence that al-Qaida was exaggerated. I think that there is a consensus within expert opinion now that the Ethiopian invasion did far more harm than good and that if we could turn back the clock, I think that we would have a very different strategy playing out. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet, al-Qaida did provide funding to al-Shabaab and training to its troops. BRONWYN BRUTON : It did, absolutely. And, you know, that's a point of debate within the intelligence community too. There is a very a strong school of thought that said basically that Somalia is inoculated from terrorists groups, that in the past, in the 1990s, for example, al-Qaida tried to gain a foothold in Somalia. It has failed miserably because of the conditions on the ground. The Somalis don't like foreign interference. They don't trust the Arab brand of Islam. The leaders that al-Qaida tried to work with on the ground were provincial. They were not interested in the international jihad. And so, you know, al-Qaida's re-entry into Somalia in 2006, you know, it was alarming, but it was not a forgone conclusion that Somalia would become a safe haven. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jeffrey Gettleman, the factor that, of course, we have to consider here is the famine and that has been so damaging in the southern and eastern parts of Somalia. With the losses, territorial losses of Shabaab, has more aid been able to be delivered to more people? JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Not really because this has happened and it's happened in an environment of conflict, so the Kenyan military has taken over certain parts of Somalia from the Shabaab. The Ethiopians have done the same thing. The African Union has done same thing, but it's part of a conflict. So the aid groups are not able to access those areas very easily right now. And there's even been increased displacement and suffering in some areas. I was just in Mogadishu a few weeks ago, and I wrote a story about an increase, a sharp increase in the number of women who are being raped both by government forces and freelance militias and also by the Shabaab. So, you know, we're not seeing like a real dramatic difference on the ground. This is still kind of at the midpoint of this story. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : And I think the biggest factor with the famine is that it's been raining a lot in East Africa. This year has had very heavy, steady rains. So I don't think you're going to have the food crisis next year that you had this past year, but things are still, you know, very fluid and very messy on the ground in Somalia. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Bronwyn Bruton, as we look ahead towards if indeed the scenario we painted - nothing is certain in any conflict, but if Shabaab is fragmented and splintered and if it is reduced as a force incapable any longer of administrating territories, all these different players, how do you get them to sit and wait or encourage the development of what you were talking about, an internal solution? BRONWYN BRUTON : The answer to that is not a happy one, unfortunately. When we talk about Somali development, we have to understand the illiteracy rate is so high. The ability of Somalis to do something as simple as send money from Minnesota to Mogadishu to support their family has now been crushed. And that's a big part of the economy. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is a hawala system. BRONWYN BRUTON : The hawala system, yes. That's right. You know, it basically is a long, long haul that we're talking about, where you need to do development and education at the most basic level. It's really hard for me to take seriously the idea of nation building when you're talking about a group of people who don't have a good grasp of what democracy is, and requires so much, you know, just basic building block work that nobody really wants to do, least of all, I think, the United States. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Bronwyn Bruton, deputy director of the Atlantic Center, where she focuses on East Africa policy. Also with us, Jeffrey Gettleman, New York Times East Africa bureau chief. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Jeffrey Gettleman, if that's the situation, the agencies one would naturally turn to would be the African Union, the regional power, and then from there to the United Nations. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : Yeah. And it's interesting. The African Union is really stepping up in this situation. They are having more success in Somalia than they've had maybe anywhere else in Africa. And part of the reason is they're absorbing casualties. They, you know, they have suffered something like 500, 600, 700 men who've been killed. And the United States left Somalia in 1993 after 20 service members killed in the infamous Black Hawk Down incident. The U.N. is not willing to take those casualties. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : So one reason why the African Union has been successful in pacifying Mogadishu, to a large degree, is because they're the only ones that are willing to, you know, have their guys get killed day in and day out. It's an ugly war. The Shabaab guys are determined fighters. They're pretty good with the suicide bombs and asymmetrical tactics. And they're even decent street fighters when it comes to going toe-to-toe with the African Union. So like I was saying before, we're not finished here by any means. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : But what we're seeing is a momentum right now that resembles what happened in 2006, where you have all these different players working together to some degree to push out the Islamists, in this case, the Shabaab. And I think, you know, that's going to happen. JEFFREY GETTLEMAN : I think they're not going to be able hold territory the way they were a few years ago. But it's not going to be the end of Somalia's misery. And it would be good to see more talk about, you know, how to begin to develop a political system that the Somalis actually believe in because so few, you know, have any faith in the transitional federal government. These people do not represent the average guy or woman out in the Somali hinterland. And that's the problem. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Bronwyn Bruton, we're talking about Somalia, yet two fairly large parts of what we used to call Somalia are no longer consider themselves to be part of Somalia. That's Somaliland and Puntland. And are we going to see more and more fragmentation? Is that part possible? \n\n ###",

For years now, since before President Obama won the presidency, Washington watchers floated the idea of a Vice President Hillary Clinton. They envisioned scenarios that would allow the president to dump Vice President Joe Biden in favor of the popular secretary of state. New York Times columnist Bill Keller says it's time to do - it's just the thing to do to guarantee President Obama's re-election. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So what do you think of the Obama-Clinton super-ticket? Is it plausible; could it happen - 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bill Keller joins us now from a studio at the New York Times. His column \"Just the Ticket\" ran on Monday. Nice to have you back on the program. BILL KELLER : Thanks, Neal. Nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Barack Obama - said to be a very loyal man. How could this happen? BILL KELLER : Well, I don't know that it could happen. You know, what I was trying to make the case for is that - that I think it should happen. And as you say, the idea has been kicking around for, I mean, well over a year. And the idea surfaced a bit back in 2008, whether she should be on the ticket. So it's not even, you know, new this cycle. BILL KELLER : I just figured that the time was right to kind of lump all the arguments together, and parse them. And I think, you know, it's a long shot, partly because, as you say, Obama is a loyal guy; partly because there has, you know, the relationship between the Obamas and the Clintons has always had some - friction would be putting it politely. And if... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Doing it the week of South Carolina would be ironic. BILL KELLER : Yes, it would. You know, also, I think at this point, the White House, frankly, doesn't think that they need that kind of a move to reinforce their campaign. I imagine that - I mean, you know, in a week, when you have the Republicans taking a break from accusing Obama of being a socialist to attack Mitt Romney for being a capitalist... BILL KELLER : ...you know, that's got to, you know, cause a certain amount of smiling around the Oval Office. NEAL CONAN, HOST : They've also seen some better employment numbers - nothing to throw hats in the air over, but maybe the grimness is alleviating just a little bit. Nevertheless, what is the best argument, you think, for the Obama-Clinton ticket? BILL KELLER : Well, I'll give you three. One of them is, I think it's the single best thing the Democrats can do to assure Obama's re-election. I realize that Hillary's 64 percent - or whatever they are - approval ratings would not hold up in a campaign; that's unrealistic. But they are high. She is, you know, by some counts, the most admired woman in America, certainly the most admired member of the current administration. She brings a lot to the party. She would, you know, electrify a lot of voters - turn some off, of course. BILL KELLER : The Clintons come with baggage. But she would, I think, excite a lot of women, but not just a lot of women. So that's point number one. Point number two is, you know, maybe they do and maybe they don't need to do something like this to assure Obama's re-election, but there's a case to be made for running up the numbers, running up the score, which I think she would do. So there would be - it's an opportunity for the president to claim not just a victory, but a mandate, and maybe to carry some House and Senate seats with him. And then the third would be, that it would anoint her as the heir apparent in 2016, to run for president herself. BILL KELLER : Assuming she has the wish and the energy to do it, she would, you know, if she ran in 2016 on her - and won, on her Inauguration Day, she would be 69 years old, the same age that Reagan was when he was inaugurated to his first term. And people - some people, anyway - seemed to think that at least the first term of Reagan was OK, you know. And if she - she pretty clearly is not going to stay on for a second term as secretary of State. So if she spends those four years sort of out of the limelight, running an NGO or something like that, other Democrats are going to come in, I think, and start campaigning. Andrew Cuomo comes to mind, and I'm sure you guys could think of others. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken certainly can. But Ken, I wonder if you had some question for Bill Keller. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yikes, where do I start? I love the New York Times. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I can't live without the New York Times, and I sound like - I must sound like one of these anti-media folks here. But to me, this is a ridiculous scenario for so many reasons. You think of Spiro Agnew and Dan Quayle, vice presidents who very well may have - should have been dumped and weren't dumped. And ultimately, they didn't matter - keeping them on the ticket or not. It's really about the top of the ticket. For all the excitement about Geraldine Ferraro that, you know, Mondale still lost 49 out of 50 states. So I don't know what changing the vice president does so much. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : But here's another thing about the scenario here. If Obama-Clinton ticket losses in 2012, why would Hillary Clinton be the front-runner for 2016? Because, you know, you have the Andrew Cuomos and all the Democrats waiting in the wings. And if they won, do you think, after eight years of Obama presidency, the voters are going to go for a Democrat again in 2016 - for a third term in a row? It just seems so preposterous. BILL KELLER : Well, I think whether they're going to go for a Democrat in 2016 depends, to a large extent, on what happens between January 2013 and the next election. I mean, that's, you know, Hillary Clinton is not Geraldine Ferraro, and she certainly is not Spiro Agnew. What she brings to the ticket is a lot of credibility. I mean, she won the popular vote over Obama in 2008, so she comes with a track record and a lot of pent-up support. I can assure you from my email in-basket over the last few days that while there are still - you know, the Clintons, as I said, carry a lot of baggage - there is an enormous repository of admiration for her, and a sense that it's not just a symbolic move, or a token event, to have her as a woman on the ticket. It's, you know, she's somebody who has actually earned it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Julia Benjamin: Please, just do it - I think you're talking about getting a lot of those. \n\n ###",

This is Rich, and Rich is with us from Placerville in California. RICH : Hi, there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead, Rich. RICH : I'm a former Democrat county chair in California when Obama was elected. I think this is a dumb idea. We already have trouble enough keeping the progressives in line, in this party. And those of us who supported Obama as an alternative to Clinton, many of those folks are going to abandon us. And that, to me, would be a stupid thing to do. So thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Thanks very much. Bill Keller, what Rich is suggesting, of course, you - we think of Clinton baggage, vitriolic hatred on the right. There are some - many on the left who are not happy with her, either. BILL KELLER : I've heard that argument and, you know, it is true that if you draw the left to right scale, you know, Biden is further to the left on many issues than Hillary Clinton is. But, you know, I find it very hard to believe that Democrats are going to abandon the Obama ticket and vote for Mitt Romney or an alternative to Mitt Romney - even less likely. I think the excitement that Hillary would bring to the ticket would more than compensate for the defections of, you know, of people who think that she is too much of a centrist. You know, I just - you know, I just think this would be a smart thing, that it would be net plus. BILL KELLER : And by the way, elections - I think will Ken agree with this - elections, presidential elections tend to be decided by the moderate independents, the people who identify as independents and of the independents, the ones who identify as moderates. That is a constituency that Hillary Clinton owns. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : No - I agree with that completely. And I also think that ultimately, this will be about the state of the economy. If the economy is getting better, if more jobs are being created, then Obama can run against his improving record and compare it to the Republicans. But if the economy is bad then, you know, you could put Neal Conan on the ticket, and I don't think it would help. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, I don't think that would help anyway. But maybe somebody could find out that Hillary Clinton's - ask questions about her birth certificate, and find out that she was born in Scranton. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email from Tanya: Obama is emotionally flat. The Obama-Biden ticket is without much life or enthusiasm. If he were to select Hillary Clinton to be his VP, he would energize the Democratic Party base overnight. This question should be polled. But I believe putting her on the ticket would make a difference with independents, too, and it would almost likely ensure policy continuity where warranted, and guarantee Clinton another shot at becoming president in 2016. It'd make a big difference for me. I would enthusiastically work for the ticket with Hillary on it. Otherwise, I will still vote for Obama-Biden, but nothing more. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So there, a vote for some enthusiasm and Hillary Clinton... BILL KELLER : I hope the president is listening to the program. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I hope so, too. But Hillary Clinton - we always need more listeners in Washington - but Hillary Clinton is an exceptional campaigner. BILL KELLER : She is. She is a very good - and she has gotten better, actually. You know, in her early days as a campaigner, I think she had a reputation for being a little preachy, you know? And she's learned how to listen - or at least how to do a very good impression of a politician listening. And, you know, and she's - I watched her a bit in 2008, and I've watched her - admittedly, the role of secretary of State is not the same as being - campaigning for public office, but I'd watch her... NEAL CONAN, HOST : But she seems a lot more comfortable, yeah. She seems a lot more comfortable. BILL KELLER : She seems more comfortable in her own skin. There's a kind of warmth, and a sort of accessibility that she has grown into. She's a very appealing candidate. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : You know... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bill Keller of The New York Times. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Ken, I'm sorry I cut you off. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I apologize for that.

I don't know if it's to tweak the Democrats, or tweak President Obama, but they seem to - all the bad things they said about her when she was in the Senate, running for president; now, as secretary of State, they've been saying wonderful things. Let's see how long it lasts when she gets on the ticket. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Robin is on the line, calling from Fort Mill in South Carolina. ROBIN : Yes. I - this - Hillary Clinton on the ticket would seal my vote. Since we've had - I have been a registered Democrat my whole life, but I have been following the Republican debates religiously because I've been very disappointed in some of the weaknesses I've seen of Obama. But there are tons and tons - even in the South - of Hillary fans who have been grieving since Obama won the nomination, who would be out in force. And I think it would seal the deal.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here's an email... BILL KELLER : But Ken's coming around. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, here's an email from Stephanie, and this says: It seems like Joe Biden is doing a great job. Hillary Clinton is pretty tired after doing a great job as secretary of State. Why would they swap jobs? BILL KELLER : Yeah. Well, that's a very good question. And one thing you hear a lot from people close to Hillary - including her husband, who has said this publicly - is that she's exhausted. I mean, she has spent - she's been a road warrior for three years in some very tough places. She's living on an airplane, dealing with very tough issues. And I'm sure she is exhausted. You know, the proposal that I put in the column - and, you know, somebody else can reinvent this, but - would be that she steps down as secretary of State soon-ish - you know, early spring, late winter, early spring - and actually does take a break, rejuvenate. She can, you know, make a few million dollars by writing the next volume of her memoirs. And then, you know, come the convention in the fall, she comes back, rested - tanned, rested and ready. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Tanned, rested and ready, yeah. BILL KELLER : And meantime, you know, Joe Biden was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He's not a slouch on international policy. In fact, from the point of view of those disaffected liberals who were referenced earlier, you know, Biden is probably more popular - would maybe be a more popular secretary of state. So, you know, give him the State portfolio. I think that would be a perfectly honorable way for a Joe Biden to end a long and accomplished and distinguished career. It wouldn't be, you know, throwing him under the bus in some sort of a disloyal way. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get Linda on the line. Linda is calling us from Stockton, California. LINDA : I have to say this - I'm going to quote, ridiculous scenario. And I think it's very unwise - some might say disloyal - but very unwise for Democrats, pro-Obama people, to even discuss this. It's making Republicans, and the right wing, chuckle and laugh. It's going to make President Obama, if he did this, look weak. It's going to make them look desperate. LINDA : And I'm hoping Elizabeth Warren will be our candidate in 2016. And that's all I'm going to say, but I was an independent for many, many, many years; was a Democrat during college. Then I was an independent all the time I was raising children. And I came back to the Democratic Party and left my independent registration. And in California, you really need to have a party, you know, because of our primary system. \n\n ###",

I'm Jennifer Ludden, in Washington. Neal Conan is away. This week ushered in the new year, of course, and with it came a raft of new laws from Florida to California. States passed almost 40,000 laws last year. Many of them took effect this week; a host of others will roll out in the coming months. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Some of these new laws govern local issues and concerns, like allowing kids under 10 to hunt in Michigan or banning happy-hour drink specials in Utah. Others reflect hot-button national issues like immigration, abortion and government spending. So tell us : What are the new laws where you live, and how will they affect you? Give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org. And you can join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION. So tell us : Later in the program, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Cynthia Tucker left her long-time post at the Atlanta Journal Constitution last year. We'll talk with her about the role of opinion writing in American journalism. So tell us : But first the new laws of 2012. Joining me now in Studio 3A is Corey Dade, NPR national correspondent. Hi, Corey, welcome. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Hi, Jennifer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So, many states have been grappling with budget shortfalls. We're seeing a lot of new laws reflecting these economic woes, I guess especially when it comes to public employees. What do you see? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely, public employees is one of the places were governments, specifically state governments but even local governments, have really tried to pull in the line. Many of these public employees are being made to contribute more to their retirement benefits, and that's been something that's happened across the board in many states. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Michigan, for example, did this with their public employees; Delaware; North Dakota; so many different states. And in Arizona, for example, newly hired workers are going to receive lower benefits than the existing workers. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So smaller paychecks and not as big a pension in the end, I guess, for some. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Right, but in exchange, they still get a little bit more job security in this difficult economy. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Now, we have seen a lot of resistance to this. The protests in Wisconsin made national news. State legislatures, though, say some of them feel they have no choice. COREY DADE, BYLINE : They have no choice. The - in every state, this is the same argument that's been waged by public employee unions, by local governments that rely on state funding for everything from education, to health benefits, to Medicare. But at the same time, the state governments are saying our revenues are down. COREY DADE, BYLINE : But there are some projections, this year, that show that many state governments actually may be seeing - not so much the light at the end of the tunnel, but as many of these state legislatures come into session in January, this month - they may not be dealing with the severe budget shortages that they faced when they came in over the last two previous years. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Now, other states are looking at tax credits as another way to shore up revenues. What's going on there? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Well, in Michigan - Michigan for starters - they actually did the opposite. They reduced the earned income tax credit that goes to about 800,000 or so low-income families. That benefit was cut by 70 percent. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Wow. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Exactly. So families that really relied on it, they got a credit of about $400 ,now will get a credit of about $140. But what they did in Michigan and other states, they gave tax - more tax - they called it tax reform, but what they effectively did is start lowering, sort of, across-the-board taxes and other tariffs on businesses to try to spur economy - spur the local economy and accelerate job growth. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So, really shifting their tax structure there. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Anything else on the economic front that we should note? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Well, I think what we're seeing also is a lot of local governments and state governments are bracing for the impact of the health care law that was passed by Congress. Of course that is President Obama's health care reform law. From state to state, it is unclear what it would mean for state budgets, but one thing is clear for people who are going to be shopping for insurance. One thing the law requires is a more clear and simplified explanation of benefits. COREY DADE, BYLINE : So that is actually mandated. So from state to state, one thing that will be consistent is people looking for new coverage, maybe better rates, should have a more easily to understand set of benefits that they'll get. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : OK, moving on, we've seen a number of new laws about abortion regulations. COREY DADE, BYLINE : That's right. One that stands out is in New Hampshire. Girls who want to seek - who are seeking an abortion, first have to tell their parents or a judge. That is something that abortion advocates see as a clear pattern of trying to increase the level of oversight, the level of interdiction that - intervention, rather, that authorities can have before abortions actually take place. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Some on the other side, the pro-choice movement, think that this is going to be an open - open the door to lawsuits in New Hampshire and other states that are trying the same legislation. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And we actually have someone on the line from New Hampshire. McKayla(ph) is in Dover. Hi, there. MCKAYLA : Hi. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Go right ahead. MCKAYLA : I'm calling to make a comment upon the new law, which requires women under 18 to notify their parents or a judge. I think that it was a political boon for the Republicans, a really easy issue to convince parents that there should be a law that their teenagers tell them if they're getting an abortion. MCKAYLA : But truth be told, I mean, stuff can get really weird up in New Hampshire. You know, home situations are not always perfect, and I think that this is a really dangerous law for teenagers, women under 18. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, McKayla, thanks for the call. So Corey, this was controversial, I take it? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely, and it's not the first time this law has actually come up. This has been kicked around before this past year, when it was passed. So there's not - this wasn't one of the laws that was passed in New Hampshire that had an enormous amount of public sentiment behind it. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : We should note that a lot of laws also are taking effect to restrict immigration, tighten voter ID laws. We'll be talking a lot of about that in a few moments. But what do you - what trend overall are you seeing here, Corey? We've had a lot of - last year, we were talking about conservatives taking control of legislatures, right? So... COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely. That \u2013 conservatives, or rather Republicans, taking broader control over state legislatures and governors offices. Consider this, Jennifer: Republicans now control 28 of the 50 state legislatures, and Democrats only control about 15. The rest of the state legislatures are split between Democratic and Republican control. COREY DADE, BYLINE : And it doesn't stop there: Republicans control not only the legislature but also the governor's office in 23 states. So not only do you have legislative control, but now your party in many of these states, in the majority of states, have control of the governor's office, who actually can actually sign this legislation. COREY DADE, BYLINE : So it does reflect this sort of red-state wave that happened in 2010, and now you're seeing on the local level and on the state level a lot of legislation come out of that, like you said abortion, immigration, crackdowns on so-called voter fraud, all those things are happening. COREY DADE, BYLINE : In the case of voter fraud, in the case of voter ID, you had several states last year that passed legislation, I think it's eight, that passed legislation requiring some form of ID before they vote, which obviously we'll talk about later. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : OK, let's take another call. Matthew's(ph) in San Jose, California. Hi there. MATTHEW : How's it going? \n\n ###",

MATTHEW : Yeah, in San Jose, California, we have a new law that bans polyurethane plastic bags for all small business and large businesses. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So none at all? You can't even pay five cents for them? MATTHEW : You can pay five cents for them, but nobody seems - around me wants to pay that. And then there's also businesses that are ignoring the new law, and so people are just leaving one liquor store, going across the street and going to another one. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Oh dear, they'll have to get the enforcement up to gear there. All right, Matthew, you think it's a good law or no? MATTHEW : I personally think that it's good and that people are just going to end up having to, you know, carry bags with them, the reusable, maybe a backpack. I personally think that it's a very good thing, and I can take my comments off the air. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, thank you, Matthew. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Maybe that'll be the next legislation that comes out, the polyurethane bag police. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, we've got tens of thousands of new laws, so many, a lot of them just one-offs here and there. Illinois has an interesting one, a registry for convicted murderers. Explain that. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Exactly, when you think about registry, most of us think about the sex offender registries that are very common now in many states. But for people convicted of murders, once they do their time, and they're released from prison, the law requires or will require that they register on a database that the state will maintain, and it's done in an effort, in their minds, to alert the public of potential dangers. COREY DADE, BYLINE : But it does raise a question of how restrictive that database will be. In the case of sex offender registries, the big problem is that sex offenders are restricted from living in certain areas, obviously within certain vicinities of schools and such. So in many states what you're finding with sex offenders is that they often get pushed further and further away from communities that they actually can afford to live in. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And so we might see the same thing with convicted murderers who have served their time, or is that the concern? COREY DADE, BYLINE : That is the concern because you have to - you have to give everything. You have to give - you register your name, your address, place of birth - place of birth, your place of resident, of course, residence, of course. COREY DADE, BYLINE : But yes, it - when you have people trying to re-enter society, the opponents of this legislation raise the question of whether or not they'll be able to effectively do that. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, so a new registry of convicted murderers in Illinois. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Right. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Very briefly, what about this end of happy hour in Utah that we mentioned? How can they do that? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Well, what they did was pass a law that actually makes it illegal to have any drink specials, daily drink specials, that's what they call it, which we know as happy hour. And when you look at the state in which it occurs, I don't think too many of our listeners should be surprised by that. COREY DADE, BYLINE : But it does reflect the continued - the continued sentiments, in Utah in particular, against alcohol consumption in public. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : A state with a large Mormon population. \n\n ###",

JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right, we'll have more new state laws in a moment. We're talking about new laws taking effect in 2012.

As of January 1st, it's illegal in California to sell a live animal on any street or in any parking lot or at a carnival. Hmm. Government workers in Delaware and other states must contribute more to their retirement funds. Other states added laws in health care, employment, abortion and immigration, among others.

JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : We've got a caller in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Hi there, Jerry. JERRY : Hello. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Go right ahead. JERRY : Yeah, well, the new law that I'm a little miffed about in Michigan is they have decided to start taxing, for the income tax, for the first time public employee retirement income. And I know when I was - it's been a few years, about 10 years ago that I was a public employee, the first 15 years of my career I spent as a public employee. And at the time, I know I wasn't getting paid market value, but one of the reasons that I stayed with it was to make sure that I had a retirement plan. JERRY : As an engineer in private practice, there's no such thing as retirement plans other than 401(k)s and such that you have to self-fund. And so basically, they're going to take away, now, 4 percent every year of whatever I use out of my retirement plan. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So you're getting those benefits now? You're going to see that cut now? JERRY : In a few years. I'm just short of retirement right now. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : OK. Was there a lot of protest there in Michigan? JERRY : Actually, they're - well, I guess there's been a general march to scapegoat public employees in general at the state House. So there's been a lot of public protests, you know, from public employees on a number of issues, larger ones to current employees are benefit changes and things like that. But, yeah, so that's... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Well, Jerry, thanks for the phone call. And NPR national correspondent Corey Dade, Jerry's not alone out there. COREY DADE, BYLINE : No, he's not, especially in the Midwest states, where they've been hit particularly hard with budget shortfalls as a result of just revenue drying up to the states. We've seen it in Wisconsin. We've seen efforts similar to this in Ohio. And in Michigan, Michigan has been so decimated. They were at the tip of the spear when the recession hit. COREY DADE, BYLINE : They were actually having budget shortfalls before the recession hit. So the caller is right insofar as there's been a lot of criticism from people in so many different - in parts of the state about the different cuts that are being made - that are being placed on public employees that governments really have faced so much not only criticism from them, but really, they haven't been able to find any other levers to pull because so many of these local - state governments also, but also so many of these cities have industrial economies that have not been able to diversify. COREY DADE, BYLINE : So they have no choice, in some degree - at least the argument that comes from the governor and other public officials - but to go after the benefits of public employees. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right let's move on now to some of the big trends that we're seeing. A lot of states have focused on immigration. What's happening there, Corey? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely. As you know and many know, that last year in particular, Arizona, other states - well, Arizona did this before, but other states like Georgia, Alabama, have started passing laws that tighten up immigration enforcement. And that's specifically laws that allow law enforcement to actually become more aggressive in questioning people suspected of being illegal immigrants for documentation to prove that they're here illegally. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Alabama has the most strict law, of course, at this point, and it goes further than any other law. Now there's so much blowback to the Alabama law, that - it's being criticized as going too far, that now the legislature itself, when it comes into session this month, is actually looking at ways to scale it back. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### COREY DADE, BYLINE : So along with that, the laws or the provisions that are actually coming into effect this year are the E-Verify provisions. And this refers to the federal system, the federal database that businesses in states like Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, businesses in those states will have to go to that database, go to the E-Verify database to confirm that their new employees are actually in the country legally. And they face fines, a variety of different penalties if they do not. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And this has been a program that's been pretty controversial, and people say there's, you know, false positives or negatives. It doesn't - it definitely does not have a 100 percent accuracy rate here, but they're working on it, and it has been spreading quickly. COREY DADE, BYLINE : It has been spreading, and it's actually one aspect of many of these immigration enforcement laws that's been held up by the courts. It's been allowed to proceed, while the other provisions are still under challenge - in some cases injunction - by the federal courts. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Of course, that's because the federal government is actually suing to overturn this legislation on the state level. But E-Verify certainly has survived the legal challenge. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So another step there for some business owners. In terms of court challenges, the Supreme Court is going to look at this issue, is that right, this coming year? COREY DADE, BYLINE : The Supreme Court will not look at E-Verify because that's already been decided by the courts. But the high court did decide to take up the Arizona case, which everyone was expecting will happen. Certainly, the proponents of this law in Arizona were hoping that this would happen. COREY DADE, BYLINE : And so whatever side the Supreme Court comes down on will have enormous consequences for all these other laws. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Right. So other states may have to change or tweak their laws depending on what comes out of the Supreme Court. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Absolutely. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And what about - are there other states out there thinking of creating laws, waiting to see what happens? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Yeah, these types of laws are actually in the works in one form or another in so many different states, too many to name. Some of them have been rejected by certain legislatures over the last year or so. But I think at this point, what I'm seeing is that many states are actually pausing to see what happens with these federal cases, and they're trying to look at that and possibly actually tweak their laws before there actually is a federal decision in these different court cases or a Supreme Court decision, so that they can perhaps find a way to thread that needle and get their legislation passed eventually. So this is a very pivotal year for this whole issue. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Now, we've been talking about laws restricting - aiming to restrict illegal immigration. Some states have taken a different tact - California, for example. COREY DADE, BYLINE : That's right. California has its own version of the DREAM Act, and of course the DREAM Act was the federal provision proposed by Congress that would have actually put on a path to citizenship a certain population of Latinos in particular, but illegal immigrants whose parents came to this country and brought their children with them as babies. COREY DADE, BYLINE : And there are a bunch of different provisions that would qualify these groups of people, but on the state level in California, what they're doing is actually extending scholarships to the children who were born in other countries as infants, but have spent their entire lives here - scholarships for college. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So not just the ability to go to a public institution... COREY DADE, BYLINE : To attend, right. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : But to qualify - now, I read private scholarships at public institutions? COREY DADE, BYLINE : Right. They are - what - this is actually similar to what Illinois is trying to do. They're using their leverage - the state government is using their leverage to actually bring together private investment, nonprofits, et cetera, to fund this. And this is, in some degree, a political answer, the idea being that we're going to help these children and these young people get an education at institutions, but we're not going to put it on the backs of the taxpayer. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : OK. Corey Dade is a national correspondent for NPR. He's with us here in Studio 3A. Thank you so much. COREY DADE, BYLINE : Thank you, Jennifer. \n\n ###",

She's been covering voting identification laws around the country. Welcome, Pam. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : Glad to be here. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Now, before we dig a little deeper, let's just clarify: We're talking about laws that require voters to present a certain kind of identification, right, when you go to vote. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : That's right. We're talking specifically about a government-issued photo ID. Lots of states require some kind of ID, but these are very strict rules that require these specific government-issued photo IDs. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : OK, now this is an election year, so this is a very relevant topic, lots of new laws. What do you see happening? PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : Well, what we have - before this year, we only had two states that required these government-issued photo IDs. It was Georgia and Indiana. And now we have, starting this year, a number of states that either have new laws and new requirements, or might have new laws and requirements. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : Kansas, Tennessee, Wisconsin are now - those laws have gone into effect. They will require their voters to show government-issued photo ID. Laws were also passed in South Carolina and Texas, but both of those states - because of the Voting Rights Act - require the Department of Justice to approve their voting law changes. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Department of Justice blocked South Carolina's law from going into effect because they said that it would discriminate against minorities who are less likely to have this photo ID. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : I think read somewhere 20 percent less likely. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : About 20 percent, yeah, less likely. But the state is saying that it's going to challenge that decision, so we don't know what's going to happen for - but, you know, in November, what South Carolina's votes... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Just to make it more confusing. PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : Exactly, exactly. And then at the same time, there are a number of states that are considering new voter ID laws this year, which could, in fact, go into effect before the election. It's going on in Nebraska, Virginia, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey. It's a really hot topic. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Wow. Now, these laws have, obviously, been extremely controversial. Why do lawmakers say that they need them? PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : Well, the proponents - which tend to be Republican. Most of the ones - the new laws have been passed by Republican legislatures, although it's not totally the case. But they say that a photo ID is needed to prevent fraud at the polling place. They argue that - especially in this era when we have so many close elections - that even if there's a little bit of fraud, somebody coming and voting using a false identity - that, you know, it could steal the election. Although, quite frankly, there's very little evidence that there's much of this type of fraud, and what there is - it tends to be more with absentee ballots, with a lot - which a lot of these laws don't address. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Oh, really? You don't have to show the same ID, obviously, I guess, (unintelligible). PAM FESSLER, BYLINE : It depends, state by state. Some states, you do have to show ID if you submit an absentee ballot, but some others, you don't. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Hmm. Let's get a caller in the line, Calvin in Sumter, South Carolina. Hi there, Calvin. CALVIN : Good evening. How are you doing? JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Good. CALVIN : Out here, we are the only state to have that bill shut down, because it's a very, very bad bill, like you said, your guest said. There's never been no case of voter fraud here. Now, what is the fraud is that 217,000 people here in South Carolina, it would have disenfranchised. You would have - (unintelligible) would have - took them - their rights away from them. Now, that is the fraud. And a matter of fact, it's five million across the nation that a lot of these bills that some states have allowed to pass would disenfranchise. CALVIN : But what it has done, it has poisoned the mind of a lot of people thinking that now they can't vote without this voter ID. So no, I think they need to - the states need to be responsible for putting it out there that they can vote with their - without their ID. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. It's a story we've heard before: A doctor prescribes a fake pill to a patient after other medications have failed. The patient begins to feel better after taking what she thinks is a real drug, but is only a placebo. IRA FLATOW, HOST : The story is not fictitious. It's rooted in real data. One study estimates 50 percent of U.S. physicians who believe in the benefits of placebos and the placebo effect secretly give dummy pills to unsuspecting patients. The ethical-questionable practice led researchers at Harvard University to explore whether the power of placebos can be harnessed honestly, and what they found was the placebos work even when patients are in on the secret that it is a sham treatment. They know that they're taking a placebo, and it still works. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Ted Kaptchuk is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Med School, director of the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. The program was created last summer and is wholly dedicated to the study of placebos. He joins us from Cambridge, Mass. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. TED KAPTCHUK : Ira, thanks for inviting me. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How do you define a placebo? TED KAPTCHUK : Well, a placebo is a sugar pill or inert substance that's used to hide the genuine treatment in a clinical trial. A placebo effect is the effect of a sugar pill. The problem with that common definition is that it's an oxymoron: An inert pill can't have an effect. So what our team says is that the placebo is also hiding a very important phenomena: the clinical encounter. We think the placebo effect is the - a surrogate marker, or a way of measuring the effect of just caring for a person, the act of caring for a person. TED KAPTCHUK : We think that it's - the placebo is about the words, the gestures, eye contact, warmth, empathy, compassion that a physician exchanges with a patient, a doctor-patient relationship. We think the placebo is about medical symbols, white coats, diplomas, prescription pads. We think the placebo is about medical rituals, the ritual procedures in medicine : waiting, talking, disrobing, being examined and being treated by pills or surgery. Ultimately, we think the placebo is about the power of the imagination, trust and hope in the medical encounter. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Can you quantify any of this, then? TED KAPTCHUK : Well, that's what my work is, and that's what our program at the Beth Israel Deaconess and Harvard Medical School is trying to do, is that this is usually considered the art of medicine. It's in the background. People are mostly concerned about drugs, procedures and surgery, and our job is to quantify what's been hidden in the background and move it to the foreground, to make the human aspects of health care more prominent and optimalize them once we understand what they can do and how they work. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Because we hear that the placebo effect works about 30 percent of the time, correct? TED KAPTCHUK : No, that's more of a medical myth. Sometimes - sugar pills will not shrink a tumor, will not lower cholesterol, don't lower hypertension. Placebo effects work in some conditions much better than others. Placebo treatments will work in things like pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, functional bowel disorders, functional urinary disorders. So that 30 percent is really a myth that was created a long time ago. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you've discovered - let me see if this is correct - that even when the patients know they're taking a placebo, it still works? TED KAPTCHUK : Well, discovery is a big word. We - what we did was we randomized patients with irritable bowel syndrome, half of whom went - we gave them placebos. We told them it was placebos. The bottle said they were placebos. We told them that the study was about placebos. This is an inert pill they were taking. And half of them we randomized to no-treatment control wait-list to make sure that if they changed and got better, it wasn't the normal, natural waxing and waning of diseases or spontaneous remission. TED KAPTCHUK : And we found, after three weeks, that people who were taking placebos did much better than those in the comparison group. Our study was small. It needs to be replicated. It's more proof of principle. But it certainly changes the conventional wisdom, which was if you know you're taking a placebo, you're not going to get better. TED KAPTCHUK : And what we - I think many other teams have to replicate this in other diseases, and we hope that that will happen down the line. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But you're saying, if I heard you correctly, just to go back on your original statement, is that the placebo basically masks, or it's really the encounter with the doctor and all the trappings of the office and being taken care of that - is the action that is actually helping the patient and making the patient feel better. TED KAPTCHUK : I think that's what I meant to say. I'm glad you said it that way. Yeah, a sugar pill doesn't do anything. What does something is the context of healing. It's the rituals healing. It's being in a healing relationship. And that's what we study. TED KAPTCHUK : But the placebo pill is a wonderful tool, or a saline injection is a wonderful tool to isolate what is usually in the background, take it away from the medications and procedures that medicine does, and actually study just the act of caring. That's, I think, what we're measuring when we study placebo effects. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And how did you get involved in this, in Harvard opening up this center? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### TED KAPTCHUK : I was originally hired at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in 1990 to help do research in Asian medicine. And when I got there - my original training was in Asia - they talked about we have to find out whether this intervention, be it acupuncture, herbs or other kinds of alternative therapies, is more than placebo. And I would ask : So what does it mean that it's more than placebo? And they say: Well, it's more than placebo. And I have a background in civil rights when I was a young person. And I said, boy, they're treating this placebo effect like it's really some kind of disgusting phenomena. And what is it exactly? So I would ask, and I realized there wasn't a lot known. And I thought this would be a better way of doing my career. And I would ask : Luckily, at that time, the NIH created a National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which has a deep interest in investigating the placebo effect. And I've been able to receive funding for many, many experiments, which hopefully have contributed to understanding this phenomenon better. IRA FLATOW, HOST : One criticism of giving patients placebos is that it's unethical, it involves deception. TED KAPTCHUK : Anytime one deceives a patient, in my opinion, it is unethical. The clear standard of ethics is transparency, respect for person and informed consent. The only time you're able to do deception is if a patient agrees in a randomized control trial that things will be concealed. TED KAPTCHUK : So my job is to think of ethical ways of optimizing the different aspects of the therapeutic encounter so that we can use placebo effects ethically. The second way, my job is, to try to figure out: Is there a way of using sugar pills in situations where we really don't have good therapies, where the sugar pill may be valuable? TED KAPTCHUK : A third aspect of my job is to figure out ways of lowering placebo effects, because one of the problems for drug development is that sometimes the drug may be effective, but it competes with the placebo effect, and it's very hard to detect the difference. So those are my three jobs that I think I'm doing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You had some interesting findings of an asthma study that you did. TED KAPTCHUK : Yeah, our asthma study was published in the New England Journal this summer. It was funded by NCCAM at the NIH, and it was - it actually came out different than we expected. We gave - we bought time from asthma patients, 40 patients. And we brought them in, and we took them off their medication 12 different times. TED KAPTCHUK : And we brought them in every few days at one session, and at different times, we gave them an active bronchial dilator, albuterol, which is an effective drug for relieving asthma. Three times we gave them fake inhalator. Three times we gave them fake acupuncture, and three times we gave them no treatment, just sitting and doing nothing, because sometimes people get better by just sitting and doing nothing. We want to make sure that it's this - the placebo that's doing something, not just sitting and waiting. TED KAPTCHUK : And we had a very interesting finding that actually we didn't expect. We found that when we looked at objective measures, the amount of air that's pushed out of the lungs in one second, we found that the real medication was - showed a great improvement. The two placebos - the placebo inhalator, the placebo acupuncture - had a little bit of improvement, and the sitting there and doing nothing had a little bit of improvement. TED KAPTCHUK : There actually was no placebo effect at all on an objective measure on the pathophysiology of asthma. But then my asthma colleagues said, oh, my God. This whole experiment didn't work. And I said, someone get the statistician to get the subjective outcomes. How did people feel? TED KAPTCHUK : And when they crunched the numbers while we were waiting, it turned out that the - when you asked the patient how much they feel relief from their asthma, their subjective experience, their own personal sensation, the real medication was very effective. The fake inhalator was very effective, and the fake acupuncture was very effective. And just sitting there for two-and-a-half hours was - is very, very little. TED KAPTCHUK : And what we found was that on subjective, person-centered, how one feels, there was no drug effect, because the drug was no different than the two placebos. And it - we inferred to this, at least in this situation, that the placebo effect is mainly about how we experience things: symptoms, complaints, how we react to the underlying pathology. TED KAPTCHUK : Whether this applies across the board I think is too early to say, but I think it can say - at least in this experiment - it looks like the placebo is about the experiences that patients have, not necessarily about the underlying pathology. But obviously, more research. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. You didn't prevent the underlying pathology from working, but the patients didn't mind as much that something... TED KAPTCHUK : Well, they felt as good as taking the drug, yeah. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, they felt as good as taking the drug. TED KAPTCHUK : Right, absolutely. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. Is there any message here for doctors? We've got about a minute left. Any message here...? \n\n ###",

Reilly play the parents of a disturbed, disruptive, manipulative son, who systematically undermines his mother and his parents' marriage. At one point, we see them in their living room discussing a breakup. NEAL CONAN, HOST : JOHN C. REILLY: (As Franklin) At least custody is a no-brainer. TILDA SWINTON : (As Eva) Is it? You've decided?

EZRA MILLER : (As Kevin) Why would I not know the context? I am the context. NEAL CONAN, HOST : \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\" is based on the novel by Lionel Shriver about a mother coping with the aftermath of her son's Columbine-like killing spree.

Academy Award winner Tilda Swinton joins us now from our bureau in New York. Nice to have you with us today on TALK OF THE NATION. TILDA SWINTON : Hello, Neal. Happy New Year. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And happy New Year to you. Can you tell us, what attracted you to this part? TILDA SWINTON : Well, what attracted me to the film was Lynne Ramsay, the director, who's an extremely talented filmmaker who has made way too few films, in my opinion, and I was waiting for another film from her. We became friends during the time in between her last feature, which is about nine years ago now. She made two features, one called \"Ratcatcher,\" and the other called \"Morvern Callar.\" And \"Morvern Callar,\" I think, was about nine years ago. And we became friends. And I - when I heard that she was adapting this book, which I knew quite well, I was really intrigued because anybody who knows this book, it's quite a chunk of change, and Lynne Ramsay herself is no slouch. So the idea or the combination was really compelling. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The book is a series of letters... TILDA SWINTON : Yeah. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...a woman sitting, writing letter after letter, intelligent, smart, acidly funny, in some respects. The film is entirely different. TILDA SWINTON : Well, the grace and the torture of adapting good books is that you got to throw them away if you're going to make a possible film. This book has a lot of words in it, as books tend to, but it has really rather more well-chosen words than a lot, and it is, as you say, all written letters. TILDA SWINTON : And it's about somebody - it's written - my character, Eva, is writing these letters to her husband Franklin, who you - throughout. You can see that they're separated, and she's trying not only to describe, but also to explain and understand the story of their life together and the upbringing of their child, who becomes such a problem, to say the least. And so the whole premise of the book is about, you know, trying to be articulate. TILDA SWINTON : And we realized in making the film and developing the screenplay that that was going to be the very opposite of our project. Our project was going to be about not being able to - it's about being - things being unspeakable, literally, about having nobody to talk to. I mean, unless you are going to film over somebody's shoulder while they write screeds and screeds of letters, we knew we were going to have to, you know, throw that element out and make a great departure. So I would say that the film is inspired by the book in a way that it's not really an adaptation because its premise is so different. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As you mentioned, she is very articulate in the book. In the film, the character you play is almost shattered. \n\n ###",

I mean, I call her dumb, but I mean that she's numb and dumbed. She has nobody to talk to, and she's really unraveled at the point which we meet her. We quite quickly - there's no spoiler alert needed for the fact that, you know, very early on in the book and very early on in the film we get to know that this boy has perpetrated, you know, a high school killing. And so, that's not a, as it were, a big deal narratively to let that away. So we know that she's having to deal with that. TILDA SWINTON : We see her very early on being thumped in the face by a stranger for smiling and having her car and her house painted with red paint by passersby. We can see as some kind of martyr. And she has nobody to talk to about this at all. And I love this element, I have to say, not just in a quite masochistic way... TILDA SWINTON : ...but I find there's something very beautiful when a character is so alienated that their only company is the audience. And so, we, as the audience, become, you know, we have to follow it through because nobody else is following it through for her. And so her only company is us, as we watch this film. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We, as the audience, sometimes ask the character, though, we see you scrubbing the red paint off the car, off the house, that hobble that she lives in. How about a can of paint? Why doesn't she just move to the next town over? TILDA SWINTON : But, that would - that's a healthy person, Neal, who suggests that. TILDA SWINTON : She's got red stuff to clean off her hands. That's her deal, you know. She - when she's thumped in the face by the passerby, one of the first things she says is, it's my fault. It's not something that she can paint over. It's something that she has to try and scrape away because it belongs to her. One of the things that's very kind of important in the telling of the story of the upbringing of this child is he - I mean, he's pretty monstrous, let's face it. It's kind of a mother's nightmare. It's - I call it the feel-good film of the year because... TILDA SWINTON : ...those who have children come waltzing out of the cinema, going oh, my kid, we thought he was a problem, but he's nothing compared to that one. NEAL CONAN, HOST : (Unintelligible). TILDA SWINTON : And those who don't have children, you know, just, you know, all too happy to go home and sleep across the bed. There's this feeling that all his misanthropy and all his violence and all his alienation is that bit worse for her because it's not actually exotic to her. It's absolutely familiar. It's hers. So this red paint is hers. She feels she deserves it. She really feels that she is to blame. And by the way, who can blame her? Because all of us, we don't have to have monstrous children to think that we are responsible for their every action. NEAL CONAN, HOST : More on, I guarantee you, sales of archery sets will plummet. But the question, as you raise, we debate nature-nurture. The mother is on the edge of both of those horns. TILDA SWINTON : Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, but that's a - I mean, yes, I've said it's a nightmare and it is. It's not a social commentary, this film. It's, you know, it's a fictional story about people who don't actually exist and were dreamed up by a writer and now envisaged by a filmmaker. But it is about, you know, the grain in the bottom of the oyster that makes the pearl of it is something that we can all encounter. Not even - we don't have to be parents to do it. I mean, we're all children of parents, so we all know how our parents feel responsible for us. It's - really doesn't take much imagination to imagine ourselves there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get a caller involved in the conversation. Of course we're hearing Tilda Swinton on the line from our bureau in New York. Her most recent picture is \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" which is just opening now. Tracy is on the line, calling us from Grand Rapids. TRACY : Hi. Thank you, Tilda.

I'm Ira Flatow. Our next story is about ferrets, those furry little animals that some people keep as pets but which some scientists use as guinea pigs, and that's the story that interests us because experiments using ferrets to study how the bird flu spreads has caused quite a commotion in the world of science. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Two labs, one in the Netherlands and the other in Wisconsin, say they have developed a deadly strain of bird flu virus that can be transmitted through the air from ferret to ferret, something that couldn't happen easily before. A federal advisory board has urged the journals Science and Nature not to publish the details, all the details of the research. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Members of the advisory board and some biosecurity experts are concerned that the research could fall into the wrong hands. Other researchers disagree, and they call the studies too valuable not to share with the scientific community. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So we're going to talk about that this hour, our number 1-800-989-8255, sort of have a debate between two sides of the issue, and let me introduce my guests. Dr. D.A. Henderson is professor of public health and medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He's also a distinguished scholar at the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He led the successful worldwide effort to eradicate smallpox in the '70s and directed the U.S. Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness after the deadly anthrax letter attacks. He joins us from WYPR in Baltimore. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Henderson. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DR. D.A. HENDERSON: Very happy to be with you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thank you. Dr. Vincent Racaniello is a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, and he is here in our New York bureau. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. IRA FLATOW, HOST : DR. VINCENT RACANIELLO: Thank you for pronouncing the name right. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Well, we try. I pronounce them so badly so many times that even my own name gets wrong. Let me begin with you, Dr. Racaniello. What do we know about this virus developed by the two labs? RACANIELLO : So we know little because it hasn't been published. That's important to point out at the outset. What we know is what we've heard through stories, and that is that the scientists in the Netherlands took avian H5N1 influenza virus strain, which is lethal in ferrets but is not transmitted, and they passed it from ferret to ferret until they obtained an isolate that could then be transported through the air from one ferret to another, from a ferret in one cage to an uninfected ferret in another. RACANIELLO : And then they identified the genetic changes that occur to accompany that process. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And you say that we don't know that much about it because stuff has been held back. RACANIELLO : That's right. IRA FLATOW, HOST : What has been held back? RACANIELLO : So the methods, how exactly they passed the virus from ferret to ferret, what types of ferret, how many ferrets, how much virus they put in and most importantly the genetic changes that occurred when the virus was able to pass from one ferret to the other. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And why would you need to know those things? RACANIELLO : So we don't understand why the H5N1 viruses do not transmit among people, and this kind of experiment gets at that, why the virus is not able to be transmitted. We can't do that experiment in people, obviously, so we use an animal model, which is the ferret. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson, you believe it was the correct call to hold back that data. HENDERSON : I do believe it was, no question about it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Tell us why. HENDERSON : I think we're dealing here with a very serious organism, which if indeed it did spread well among people and killed as many people as it has to date, occurring as individual cases or small groups of cases, and that is a death rate of more than 50 percent, we would have a real disaster on our hands. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### HENDERSON : So how this organism spreads is important, but once it is - the information is made widely available, I think the fear is that this will be a point of experiment for a number of people, and we have to worry about an accident in a laboratory, release, escape by some means. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Racaniello? RACANIELLO : So this is a common misconception about H5N1 avian influenza, that it's highly lethal. The number of 50 percent lethality is quoted widely. What that means is half of the 600 people who have been admitted to hospitals die. But we don't know how many people have been infected, and there is some good evidence that many more people have been infected without being sick. RACANIELLO : And so that would make the virus much less scary than everyone thinks it is. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson? HENDERSON : Well, wait. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Go ahead, respond. I'm giving you a chance, go ahead. HENDERSON : OK, with all deference to Dr. Racaniello, there is one study that was done in Thailand, just recently reported, in which it appeared that nine percent of the population did carry antibody against the H5N1. However, since back in 2003, there have been many studies done of patients and the individuals in their family, in their village, contacts in hospitals and so forth. The transmission rate is extremely low. HENDERSON : We're looking at one or two cases, and thus we're seeing - counting the cases that way, and these are more than 20 studies. You would see that the death rate was right around 50 percent, and that seems to hold up from the small outbreak to small outbreak. HENDERSON : The study in Thailand is a distinct exception to anything that's been seen. RACANIELLO : There have been about 17 or 18 such studies done, starting in the late 1990s, when these viruses first infected people up to the present, and there are a handful that show seropositivity in certain populations. I think we need to go into rural Asian populations that have contact with poultry and really get at this. Before we do that, we can't say that this virus is 50 percent lethal. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson, if there is so much concern on your part and the part of others about the outcome of this research, why was this study given the go-ahead to begin with if it might have turned out this way? HENDERSON : Well, I think decisions with regard to research are usually in the hands of investigators and their institutions. Very rarely is there any imposition on the part of government with regard to what one does or doesn't do with the viruses. HENDERSON : However, I think it's important to point out that there is precedent for a group of scientists to get together and, working with government, impose restrictions on the use of a virus, which was highly lethal and would have an enormous effect if it was - got into the population. HENDERSON : And that pertains to smallpox virus, which carries a case fatality rate, death rate of about 30 percent. Most of the population of the world now, roughly 75 percent, are fully susceptible to it. We don't really have enough vaccine to control it, and the concern was that if it got out, began to spread, we'd have a hard job controlling it. HENDERSON : It was felt to be serious enough that it was decided that only two laboratories would be allowed to work with the virus. And those two laboratories, one in Moscow, one in Atlanta, two laboratories with a history of working with it, and secondly that any protocols that they wished to implement, studies, would have to pass muster with an international group of scientists in regard to the need for doing it and risk and so forth. Both are working in high-security laboratories. Now, that provision has been in place more - really more than 10 years, and it is still being adhered to today. HENDERSON : Now this is not to suggest that H5N1 would be handled in the same way, there are different conditions here, but what has been established is a precedent where there are a group of scientists and governments who decide that this is too serious a virus or organism to be circulating, and we should keep this under the closest of supervision. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Racaniello? RACANIELLO : It's clear in this post-9/11, post-anthrax situation that we need to regulate in some way experiments that are perceived as dangerous. You have to always balance the danger imposed by an experiment versus restricting publication. Science works best when information is freely exchanged. RACANIELLO : In my view, the science in this case does not support the view that this is a dangerous experiment to release information about. It's not the one to set the precedent going forward. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### IRA FLATOW, HOST : I recall back in 1974 when genetic engineering was in its infancy, and the tools were being developed, there was the Asilomar Conference. I'm sure - you're shaking your head, you remember. RACANIELLO : Correct. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And scientists got together to discuss whether this brave new world of genetic engineering would creep out of the laboratory uncontrollably, and they voluntarily stopped their research while they had this discussion. Would something like that be workable in this situation? RACANIELLO : So I started my work with recombinant DNA just at that time. I remember it well. And many scientists got together and said wait, this may be dangerous, let's talk about it, far more scientists than are on the NSABB, for example, the board that is intervening in the H5N1 studies. RACANIELLO : So I think this would be a great idea to talk about science, to get a very wide community of scientists together and talk about what are the dangers, what kinds of experiments do we have to restrict, and which do we have to restrict publication of. I don't think this is the example to set the precedent for that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : No. Dr. Henderson? HENDERSON : I would be supportive of this with one exception. I don't see this, at this point, being a time to look at the possibility of working with any virus and under any circumstances. I think the smallpox virus situation is what we call an outlier, an extreme situation. In the case of the H5N1, as they say, I think we have a difference of opinion on what the case fatality rate is, but it certainly looks to me from the 20 or so studies been done that it's about 50 percent. It is now been demonstrated to be able to be transmitted from ferret to ferret. HENDERSON : There's a belief that that may have application in humans that it could be transmitted from human to human by aerosol. If we had a release of this mutant virus into the air and it was able to be transmitted, as appears it can be transmitted at least to some degree, we, I think, are taking a real risk. Were it to escape, I don't see anyway by which you can control it. We could control smallpox. If a smallpox escaped from a laboratory, we have the vaccine. We could control it. So it poses less of a threat in terms of transmission and less of a case fatality rate than does H5N1. HENDERSON : But H5N1 is in the outer limits of the spectrum, and the question is: Are we willing to go through experiments to make the virus, a mutant virus available to a number of different laboratories, to risk the possible escape from the laboratory of that virus, or are we going to control it much more severely and hold the data and maybe have the discussion? But keep the discussion focused on an agent which potentially is now, I think, many agree, potentially a catastrophic virus. RACANIELLO : I think there is no reason to assume that this virus will transmit among humans based on the ferret experiments. Ferrets have been shown to be wrong over and over. The 2009 swine-origin virus, when it first emerged, was put into ferrets. It was highly lethal and deadly. Everyone warned that this would be a bad virus. It turned out to be milder than we think. So I think that that's not a good argument to use if we are really worried about H5N1 spreading. And I think it's been around a long enough time, it's infected enough people to be able to acquire that capability. If we're really worried, we should stockpile antivirals, which are known to inhibit viral replication and perhaps even a vaccine. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Talking - and the debate about whether some research with ferrets and the spread of bird flu among them should be totally released in two journals, Science and Nature. My guests are Dr. D.A. Henderson, Dr. Vincent Racaniello. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Some questions coming in on Twitter. You can also tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I. Thebrownword(ph) wants to know how much of this info has already been sort of WikiLeaked, published on the Internet? How much could a scientist guess about what has happened? RACANIELLO : Well, we know that if you pass the virus in ferrets, you can make a transmissible form, and that's a relatively easy experiment to do. So that's out. And the next step to knowing the sequence is really easily obtained. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So that - you're saying that hiding the details really doesn't matter. RACANIELLO : That's right. I don't think it's of any effect at all. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson? HENDERSON : Well, I think the virus that has been involved here with the transmission experiments, we do not know what the genetic character of it is. We can suppose that we have not some knowledge of it, but we don't know this for sure. I'm sure this will be in the paper. I think there are other factors on this that I would think we would do better, at this time, to say stop and let's talk about it and let's not plunge on. Meanwhile, what I think we ought to be doing is developing a much larger capacity to produce influenza vaccine than we now have, which we need anyway, for - in - with other pandemics, which we know we can expect. HENDERSON : And that we look to advances - the science and the vaccine technology so that we have a vaccine that is more broadly protective and for a longer period of time. And we could put a good deal of money into that and a good deal of scientific work and, I think, have something which would be a value irrespective of whether it is needed for H5N1, it is needed generally for other vaccine strains. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You know, we are in our 21st year of SCIENCE FRIDAY. Every single year, I could take Dr. Henderson, I could take your statement and play it going back 20 years. IRA FLATOW, HOST : We need to develop an alternative method of making vaccines, yada yada yada, and we should do something and, you know, something every - it's always 30 years away, like nuclear fusion or something. It's developing a new way to make these vaccines. Dr. Racaniello? RACANIELLO : Well, it's being worked on. There are very promising alternative vaccines, for example, made in plants. \n\n ###",

So I think it's going to be less than 20 or 30 years. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You agree, Dr. Henderson? HENDERSON : I do indeed, and I would say, even now, we're producing influenza vaccine and tissue cell culture rather than in eggs. We see ways by which it could be - the antigenicity can be broadened. And I think we can get a much better vaccine. We're already on the way, but we have not addressed this as a serious matter, that is to really move ahead on it. And I can say that with some feeling because it was 2006 that we made a strong pitch to put more money into vaccine production. $200 million was made available to some four different laboratories. That was later raised to $2 billion to speed the process along, plus the product has not been outstanding - could be a lot more done. And I think we need to press on. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right.

You can tweet us, @scifri, also go to our Facebook page at SCIFRI and our website at sciencefriday.com. Talking with Dr. Vincent Racaniello and Dr. D.A. Henderson. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about two bird flu studies that may not be published in the fall due to security concerns. Talking with Dr. Vincent Racaniello, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, and Dr. D.A. Henderson, professor of public health and medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Lots of - what was the - let me just get - bring us up to date. What is the status of those studies? Are they being just held up, the details? RACANIELLO : Well, my understanding is that journals are negotiating with the NSABB to determine exactly how the papers will be phrased. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to Raul(ph) in Columbia, South Carolina. Hi, Raul. RAUL : Hi. I had a question regarding the leaking the details of the study. So science says that it wants this information to be open and that perhaps specific details of the study should be distributed within a particular group of approved scientists. But how exactly do you create those (technical difficulty) for \u2013 who is an approved scientist? How do you evaluate who's trustworthy? Does someone coming from an academic institution, such as Duke or Harvard, does that just immediately make them eligible to receive information? Is there some sort of test that we have to give to ensure that the people who receive this information are trustworthy? How do you create those guidelines and evaluate who can receive this information? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson, you want to tackle that? RAUL : Sorry, what? HENDERSON : Well, I think that is a real problem, and I think the more that this information is disseminated even to - even a small whatever arbitrarily limited group is there, there's going to be - it's a challenge, and more people are going to be involved in experimenting. And I think there's no question about it. Scientists are curious people, and this is set out as a real challenge. I think what is needed is for the science community to be fully educated as to what the real risk is here. HENDERSON : If the real risk is, as I perceived it and I know a number of my colleagues do, this is a virus that we shouldn't really be experimenting with, even - except under the most rigid circumstances of safety. So one mistake in one laboratory and one escape with the pace that influenza normally spreads, you don't have a chance of stopping it. And we've looked at this again and again. I've been involved with the most recent epidemic, 207 \u2013 2007 back in 1957, we tried to stop or contain outbreaks of influenza, and it was just impossible. It was beyond you before you could really do anything about it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Racaniello? RACANIELLO : I fully appreciate the need for virologists to be educated about biosecurity, and I also would like the biosecurity specialists to be educated about the science underpinning our views on this. And again, the science says that this is not a large threat, the use of ferrets, the natural course of the disease, not being transmissible, the wrong case fatality ratio, all of this is something you need to consider beyond just worrying about someone nefarious getting hold of this information. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So here, you're saying there's a dispute between microbiologists who actually work with the viruses and epidemiologists who study the spreads of diseases. Is there a disconnect you're saying? RACANIELLO : So I have talked with many influenza virologists about it, and they are, to the number, all in favor of releasing this information. The caution is being raised by epidemiologists and biosecurity experts, which is, of course, their job to do so. So there - yes, there is some kind of disconnect, and they have to get together and talk about this. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Dr. Henderson, do you think you could modify your views a bit if you spoke more with them or are you pretty set in the way you believe? HENDERSON : Well, I - it sounds to me like maybe Dr. Racaniello is pretty set on the way things he believes in this case. And I think we're looking at it, yes, in different ways, but I think there are a number of virologists who are fully in accord with what I've been talking about. And there a number of virologists who have been very supportive of the restrictions that have been imposed on smallpox. At the same time, I think there is a concern here and the public health concern ultimately, that is our concern, the health of the public. \n\n ###",

This has happened before. It will happen again. And so that at this point in time, I think Doctor Racaniello was right. I think what we do is stop where we are, right now. And we had that dialogue, or we had that discussion about the - among the people concerned as to where we go from here. But meanwhile, I would say, I don't think it would be wise to publish it. And I would say, let's have the discussion as he suggests. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How quickly could - if you've now just decoded the virus, how quickly can you make a vaccine for it in advance of any other research that you might? RACANIELLO : Well, if you make an egg-based vaccine, it takes you six months minimum to that. If we make a - but the other vaccines which would be quicker to plant, based ones, as I mentioned, they're faster, but they're still experimental. So it's still a long time, and we're always behind the curve when a pandemic emerges. We're always very late in hitting that first outbreak with vaccine. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How long did it take for this vaccine to mutate itself - the virus to mutate between the ferrets, going back and forth? RACANIELLO : Well, according to what we've read in science, it took 10 ferret-to-ferret passes. So you pass it - you infect the ferret. You harvest what the ferret makes. You infect another ferret. You do that 10 times. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So you manually have to do the infection. And by the 10th time, they were infecting each other? RACANIELLO : By the 10th time, the virus that you got from that 10th ferret, if you then infected a ferret in one cage, that ferret would infect an uninfected animal in a separate cage. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And ferrets have generally been used as models for human? RACANIELLO : Yes. For influenza, they are very good models because they do a lot of the things that we do when we get flu. They sneeze and cough and get a fever and so forth. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So then, what is wrong with Doctor Henderson's reading here? If they can - if ferrets can pass it easily between them - the two of them, and they're good models for humans, why are they not good models for human-to-human transmission? RACANIELLO : Well, the key there is the word model. It doesn't tell you everything that you want to know about human infection. As I referred to earlier, there are many occasions where a virus that does X in people, doesn't do the same thing in ferrets. Plus, we have this long experience with human infection with H5N1, and it simply has not transmitted, except it infects people that have contact with sick birds, for example. So I think all of that information argues against that virus being able to transmit in people. IRA FLATOW, HOST : On the other hand, do you think you microbiologists might stop, as Doctor Henderson says he might think about, and have a conversation first about... RACANIELLO : He - this is a good idea. I think, instead of publishing a watered down version of this paper, just stop. Don't publish anything and have this discussion. That would be fine. I think it's a travesty to publish a paper which doesn't allow anyone else to reproduce the results. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. And you'd go for that, too, Dr. Henderson? HENDERSON : Well, I think, yes. I think this makes sense. But I think it's a little more than passage from ferret to ferret. If I understand the studies that were done, there was one set of passages which had became more transmissible. There was another passage which was not successful. One would - might assume that there are differences between the two viruses that emerged. And the differences between the virus that we're looking at with regard to the virus that caused the transmission and the - its beginning parent, these are studies that - and information's needed. I think it's not quite so simple as just passing it from ferret to ferret. And anybody is likely to do it. I think that there are some other problems here. And I think we need to have a hard look. And I think a varied - you got to have some sort of group has to look at it. If you can't make a huge group looking at it and handling it, what you're looking at is a small group making some decisions. But I think the penalty we pay if we make a mistake could be very high, indeed. And maybe we're... IRA FLATOW, HOST : But you - but then, again, you have no concrete suggestion of how to choose that group of people. HENDERSON : It's going to have to be arbitrarily selected. There's never doubt about it. There's no other way to do it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. All right. We're going to have to leave. This is quite interesting. I want to thank both of you for taking time to be with us. Maybe we found some common ground here. And maybe there will be something - somewhere in between where you folks will get together and come up with a solution. DA Henderson is professor of public health and medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, also a distinguished scholar at the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. And Doctor Vincent Racaniello is professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University here in New York. Thank you, gentlemen. RACANIELLO : Thank you.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. The Arab Spring has been both smaller and bigger than you might think. Uprisings ousted autocrats in just three of the 22 Arab countries, but profound shifts are underway everywhere. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Change appears imminent in Yemen and some believe may now be inevitable in Syria. Reactions elsewhere range from reform to repression. Over the past week or so, NPR correspondents Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, Deborah Amos and Kelly McEvers filed a series of stories on what's changed since protest erupted and spread a year ago. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you followed their reporting and have questions, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Go to npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Later in the program, actress Tilda Swinton on her new film \"We Need to Talk about Kevin,\" but first we begin with Deborah Amos in Rabat, Morocco. And Deb, nice to have you back. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Thank you very much, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For decades, kings, emirs, presidents for life controlled almost every aspect of public life in the Arab world. As you pointed out in one of your stories, almost all of those rulers remain in power. So what has changed? DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : I think what has changed, a couple of things. One, what people call the wall of fear. It is so telling to listen to people, what they're willing to say now on the Web, on their Facebook pages. That is a big change over the last year. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : I think the other change in the places where we've had revolutions, people are talking about politics openly now, how to organize, how to motivate, how to move a population through a political party. And even in the places that are still grappling with whether the autocrat stays or goes, people are learning on-the-ground politics in ways that you haven't seen before. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : It is the beginning of a civil society in many of these places that have never had one before, and I think those two facts are extremely important over the next decade for what happens in the Arab world. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And probably no place more important than Egypt. Joining us now from Cairo, NPR foreign correspondent Lourdes Garcia-Navarro. Nice to have you back. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : Hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Islamist groups in Cairo are celebrating as they look like they have achieved a tremendous electoral success there in the polls, but this is a place that over the past year has changed in so many ways and whose future seems to be so different than it would have seemed 18 months ago. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : It's extraordinary, actually, always coming back to Egypt, because every time you come back the narrative changes so much. And right now in Egypt we're at the tail end of the parliamentary elections for the lower house, and the Muslim Brotherhood, as you mentioned, has won a crushing victory, closely followed by the Salafist Party, the ultraconservative sect of Islam. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : I've spent the day today speaking with various Muslim Brotherhood figures, and it's an interesting time for them, Neal. As one leader told me, we feel like a bird that was trapped and it has been set free. That euphoria, though, is tempered very much, tempered by the enormous responsibility that they're now shouldering. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : After decades as an oppressed opposition party, they are now about to ascend to power in this very volatile, very divided country. There are enormous challenges, many pitfalls. How will the Muslim Brotherhood navigate their relationship, for example, with the military junta that runs the country, that ostensibly wants to cling to power? LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : I got a few answers to those questions today, but Egypt is very much in flux. We're only beginning to see how the forces unleashed in this revolution will play out. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And many of those forces unleashed by the demonstrations there in Tahrir Square, demonstrations, well, largely made up, initiated and made up of secular, young, educated Egyptians who may not see themselves represented very much, did very poorly in the elections. Any regrets there? LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : Well, the groups that kick-started this revolution, as you rightly say, the revolutionaries of Tahrir, have not fared well. They continue in a lot of ways to live in a state of almost perpetual revolution. They feel, and legitimately, that there's still so much more to be done, that the military junta which rules Egypt co-opted the popular uprising and has committed many abuses subsequently. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : But the Egyptian street and many people here are just tired of the constant upheaval, and they see these groups as the culprits. So you have a very odd situation now, where the very people that kick-started what happened here, what Egyptians are so very proud of, this revolution, are now in certain circles being accused of undermining the goals of the revolution. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let me also get back to Deborah Amos. I know you've spent a lot of time in Lebanon. You're now in Morocco, places that haven't changed but have certainly felt the repercussions of change. \n\n ###",

The February 20th movement was an explosion almost a year ago, and within two months the king here responded with a new constitution and new elections. Now for the first time Morocco has an Islamist party leading the government. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : The February 20th movement is not satisfied. They are still on the streets every Sunday in a peaceful protest. We went to one on Sunday and watched them in one of the slums outside of Casablanca, and the idea for them is they keep the pressure up. There really is not an opposition party in this country. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : February 20th, this incoherent, chaotic movement, is it. And they feel that they have to stay on the street every Sunday to pressure the government to bring those promises to fruition. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Incoherent, chaotic movement, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, we could have applied those terms to the opposition in Libya, which nevertheless got itself together enough to succeed in a military revolution obviously supported by NATO air power, but nevertheless to overthrow the 40-year-old dictatorship of Moammar Gadhafi and now appears to be going back to disorganized and chaotic. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : Yes, I just came back from Libya recently, and it is extremely disorganized and chaotic. In fact, what we're seeing there is almost the beginnings of what could be the partition of the country. In many ways this revolution, which united people in this sense of purpose and overthrowing Moammar Gadhafi, has now divided people because everyone's trying to grapple over what they want the country to look like and what their place in that new country will be. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : And it is divided along sort of regional lines and also tribal lines, and so we are seeing great problems there now because what has evolved, the National Transitional Council is a very weak body, it is also itself very divided, and people are very fed up. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : They're wondering what the next step shall be. So you know, we have protests in Benghazi in the east. We have protests in Misrata. Cities that were so pivotal to the revolution are now saying we are not satisfied with the interim government, and we want elections sooner rather than later. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So be careful what you ask for in some respects. Deborah Amos, though, given the pace of change, there is nothing like going back. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : I think there is not anything going back. The place that I've spent the most time covering is Syria, and while we have now - we are in our tenth month of protest, and the statistics are grim, there's been an Arab League monitoring group that's come to Syria. The idea was that they would stop the violence, and they haven't at all. Four hundred people have died since the Arab League monitors arrived. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : However, when you look at the movement there, the political movement on the ground, yet again chaotic, unpredictable, those people cannot go back. The lessons that they've learned over the past 10 months have actually brought people together in various towns. This is very new for Syria. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : I think that this is one revolution that will take some time. The army is still on the side of the regime. The elites around President Bashar al-Assad have not cracked. I think that you would find that they would say that of course we can go back. But the truth of the matter is that they can't. This Arab Spring has changed Syria in ways that it cannot return to the status quo. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Deb, you and I have followed affairs in this region for many years. I have to say one change that we've seen is the Arab League itself, the idea that it would have called for foreign intervention in an Arab country, unthinkable, that of course was Libya. The idea that it would send monitors to look at the human rights practices, essentially, of one of its member states and be critical of them, jaw-dropping, just 18 months ago, inconceivable. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Inconceivable, you're absolutely right, and they are feeling their way. This is all new for the Arab League, and you can see that the monitors are very stressed, that they really don't know how to do this. They wander into giant protests. They barge into hospitals. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : I think even the Syrian regime that thought that they would be able to control these monitors has not been able to, and the activists on the ground have been taking remarkable videos of certainly unscripted moments as these monitors try to figure out how to do their job. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : This is very new for the Arab League, and I think an interesting development, if they could be some sort of body in the region, it doesn't always have to go to the United Nations. There would be a local organization, the Arab League that could police internally, and that would be a huge step coming out of these revolutions in the last year.

Those are questions that I posed today to various figures of the Muslim Brotherhood, and they were all adamant in saying that they absolutely do not want to have an Islamist coalition. Sometimes we forget that the divisions between Islamists are perhaps greater than the divisions between secular and moderate Islamist organizations or conservative Islamist organizations. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : And so basically what I got across the board was a great deal of competitive talk. The Muslim Brotherhood doesn't like the Salafists. They were surprised, they said today, by their victory at the polls. They got some 20 to 25 percent. Those numbers are still not final. And they weren't really welcoming that. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : They, as they said to me, consider them to be rivals. They consider them to be part of a different strand of Islam, and they also consider them to be radicals in some sense, and they fear them because they do fear that they're going to push them to take certain actions in Egypt that aren't for the good of Egypt.

It was more like a political earthquake than a season of revolt, and the ground is still shaking.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I wanted to ask you, we've been talking about places like Cairo and like Tripoli, where change has been profound, and in places like Syria, where there appears to be no going back. I know you know some about that too, but I wanted to begin by asking you about the Persian Gulf and the uprising that was underway in Bahrain, which has a majority Shia population but ruled by a Sunni kingdom, and the Sunnis have, well, cracked down. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Yeah, I think you can say that the one Arab uprising that was definitively put down was (unintelligible). You know, you had probably a quarter to a third of the population at one point in the streets, literally hundreds of thousands of people out in the streets calling for reform at first, later calling for the downfall of the regime. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : And one month later you had international intervention of a sort, but it wasn't with the protestors this time, like it was in Libya, but it was with the government. It was troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, they rolled into town, and the protests were ended. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : In fact, the monument where the people were protesting was later bulldozed, completely cleared, and even to this day you can't even walk to that square. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In part, you concluded in your story, things did not change in Bahrain because the United States did not wish them to. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain, it's an important military asset used in the continuing watch of Iran. And in part, as you mentioned, it is because America's important ally, Saudi Arabia, did not want things to change. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : The U.S. considers Bahrain a really important ally, like you said, because of its strategic position in the Persian Gulf. You know, these are not good times with Iran, and having an ally in that position is a very important thing for the U.S. And of course upsetting Saudi Arabia is not something the U.S. does lightly either. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Saudi Arabia is worried about Iran's expansion. Saudi Arabia believed that any kind of Shiite uprising in a place like Bahrain could be seen as Iranian expansion, Iran of course being majority Shiite. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : But Saudi Arabia probably also didn't want, you know, protests in its own backyard. That was probably what was really going on. Saudi Arabia has its own Shiite population that has been agitating for years. And so keeping the Bahraini uprising down was very important to Saudi Arabia. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Deb Amos, let me turn to you on this point. To some degree what's been dismantled in - less so in Tunisia but very importantly in Egypt, was a pro-American autocrat who kept things the way America liked them, and the United States was allied not necessarily because the United States loved Hosni Mubarak but because stability was important, and stability in the Middle East remains important. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The United States now remains allied with the autocratic regimes in places like Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, and make no mistake about it. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Well, but you also have seen in the past couple of weeks reports that the Obama administration is reaching out to the Islamists. I think embassies across the region have been given instructions that we now talk to everybody. And they are having, you know, meet-and-greets with Islamists everywhere. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : What is very interesting to me, being out in the region, is these days when you do go into an American embassy, you find that the political officers there will ask you what do you think is going on. \n\n ###",

And I think it's going to take a while for the \u2013 for any American administration to figure out how to do that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Stephanie(ph), Stephanie on the line from Flagstaff. STEPHANIE : Hi, thank you for taking my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure. STEPHANIE : Yes, my question is what role women had, if any, in the Arab Spring. And then - and will these changes in any way in the Arab nations affect women's rights? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, let's turn to you in Cairo. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : Well, I think it's an extremely important question, and I think, you know, it depends on which country you're looking at, but across the board I think many women who were involved in the revolution, certainly in Libya, certainly in Egypt, they do feel that they - that it hasn't necessarily empowered them. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Here in Egypt, for example, we've seen, you know, the horrific attacks by members of the security forces against women, the sexual harassment that still continues. And there is a concern with the rise of the Islamists and political Islam, what that will mean for women's rights, enshrined in constitutions and how their rights will be protected across the board. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : And so I think there's a real concern that while, you know, these revolutions have been an earthquake, a political earthquake that have sort of - as one analyst told me today, you know, awakened the Arab soul, for women possibly they might not have done the same thing. I think it still remains to be seen exactly how it will play out and how women will be effected by this. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Stephanie, thanks for the call. STEPHANIE : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to - this is Mary, Mary with us from Davis, California. MARY : Yeah, hello, first I'd like to express gratitude for the coverage, particularly on Syria, that I heard on NPR because I think it won't surprise your reporters that even if you have family in Syria, you may not get a single news report from them by them by phone. They won't really dare say anything. So it's just how is the weather kind of talk, conversation. MARY : So I really rely on you, and I wonder if you have any inkling of when foreign reporters will actually be in Syria so we won't have to rely on getting things somehow out and about to Beirut and other places. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Kelly McEvers, in Beirut, part of the agreement the Syrian government signed with the Arab League was to provide foreign reporters access to Syria. As the Arab League monitors have access to Syria, are they following through? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Not necessarily, no. There's a trickle. Every once in a while there will be a foreign journalist that's allowed a visa into Syria. But for the most part, our requests are denied. Deborah knows this very well too. It's not an easy place to get into. And so yes, we have to report the story from Beirut, from Turkey, from Jordan, sometimes even from Iraq, from all the places, you know, that border Syria. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : And this - yeah, this was one of the elements of the agreement with the Arab League and one of the elements that observers say is not being met. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I have to ask, you went in to do some reporting with going in to Syria surreptitiously - is that going to make it more difficult to go in with the permission of the Syrian government? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : Well, we'll have to ask them, won't we? KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE : A lot of people are doing it that way these days. I mean, look, in Syria the interesting thing is there's no Benghazi, there's no sort of area that's held by the rebels. You know, there's no - it doesn't have a half of the country that's being held by the rebels. Even in the early days in Libya, it wasn't quite so cut and dried. \n\n ###",

So this isn't - there really aren't many options. I mean, it's not just that the government doesn't want us to come in, but it's not necessarily safe to go in and cover something that's looking a lot less like a protest movement and a lot more like a conflict. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Mary, what kind of family do you have still in Syria? MARY : Well, a great portion of my husband's family, just about everybody, they stayed behind. He was the only one who really left so many years ago. And yeah, it's been frustrating to try to get - you know, and we don't want to put them on the spot if we ask them. MARY : You can hear even the calls being recorded, and even things could be misinterpreted. So you just kind of say, well, how are you, how's the weather, you know, kind of sad.

We wish your husband's family the best, Mary. MARY : Thanks very much. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Appreciate the phone call. Let's see if we can go next to - this is Bob, Bob with us from Tucson. BOB : Yes, I have a question for your guests. It seems to me that the common - the concept of religious freedom is completely foreign to those people over there, and how can there ever be any success in these reorganizations and whatnot unless the Sunnis and Shiites and Alawites and so forth are free to follow their religious beliefs? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's turn to Deb Amos on that point. You've done a lot of reporting from Lebanon, which is one of the most diverse religious communities in the world. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Well, it's a complicated question because the truth of the matter is people do somewhat have freedom of religion. They certainly do in Lebanon. Everyone is allowed, all 18 different religious orientations and sects are allowed to practice their religion. And Syria has been, for generations, proud of the mix that is in the country and the fact that you can find a church next to a mosque in almost every community and certainly in the capital. The freedom of religion is not the question. The - it's not true across the Middle East. The problem is in those places where you have a mix, when there's a conflict, it is very easy for an autocrat to use sectarianism, to stir up the divisions between different parts of the population to the autocrat's benefit. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : And we've certainly seen that in Syria. I described in the piece I wrote, sectarianism 101, which is you stir up the population as the autocrat, and then you claim you're the only one that can keep the lid on the pot. And that is what we see, you know, in the Syrian's case. And so it is a complex question. I think that Lourdes can also tell us that Egypt also has its difficulties on this question. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I was going to ask about the particular situation of the Coptic Christians there in Egypt. Lourdes? LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : Exactly right. I mean, that's been one of the tensest conflicts that have sort of erupted after the revolution. You know, in many ways, people would say - and even some Christians would say that Hosni Mubarak kept a lid on that. And subsequently, we've seen, you know, attacks on Christian communities and conflicts between certain Islamic sects here and the Christians. And that is a real challenge for, you know, countries where there are different religions, different sects, people who follow different paths. And that is one of the, you know, the great challenges, I think, after the revolution. You know, basically, the lid has come off in many of these countries. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE : These were autocratic regimes, and they pride stability above all. And that meant, in many ways, keeping all of these conflicts, you know, under the table. They swept it all underground. And now, in the same way that you're seeing people come out and being able to voice their political ideals, you are seeing people voicing some things that are less savory. And these conflicts are coming out to the fore, and there is fear about what it means for minorities, what it means, you know, how are the Christians going to cope, you know, in a government that is dominated by Islamists. It's a very real concern. When many Christians here saw that the Salafists had done well, many Christians that I spoke to said, I want to leave the country. I'm worried. And so it's a very, very real problem. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Bob, thanks very much for the call. We're talking with Lourdes Garcia-Navarro. You just heard her in Cairo. Kelly McEvers is on the phone with us from Beirut. And Deb Amos is with us from Rabat in Morocco. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Deb, in one of your pieces, you put this in some historical context. This is perhaps the biggest change in the Arab world since the revolutions that shook that part of the world, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the First World War. This is 100 years ago. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : Well, one of my favorite quotes is from the head of the history department at American University in Cairo, and he called that the Lawrence of Arabia moment. In some ways, that was also - had some American flavor to it. You know, this was a moment when an American president in that period was talking about self-determination. I think you might look to these revolutions and say they were fueled, in a way, by American technology: Google, Twitter, Facebook. It is a shared value of democracy that is what the demand is on the street. So we actually have some role in what has happened. We happen to be unpopular at the moment, and that is because historically, we have supported dictators because they were better for our foreign policy. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE : But now we are confronted with a different landscape in the Middle East, one that we haven't dealt with before. And I think that is why there is such uncertainty in Washington about what does popular opinion mean. We know what it means in the American context. That leaders do have to listen to what the public wants - not completely, but they do have to listen. And we don't know what that means yet in the Arab world. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. With all U.S. forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan beginning to wind down, President Obama unveiled a new strategy for a post-Iraq era last week. Yes, there's still a lot of emphasis on special operations troops and drones to strike terrorist targets, but there's a broader shift away from the Middle East and Europe to Asia and the Pacific, a phrase that can be read as code for China. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And yes, budget reductions are part of the package, but the president and his military advisors argue they did not take a smaller number and figure out how to divvy it up but rather started with the various tasks the U.S. military needs to be able to do and then decided how much that's going to cost. So priorities : What does the U.S. military need to be able to do? How should we shift our military balance? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program : Is anything in a politician's life off-limits? Ross Douthat of the New York Times on the Opinion Page this week. But first, NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman joins us here in Studio 3A. Tom, always nice to have you with us. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Hello, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we're a long way from the end in Afghanistan, but is it fair to call this a post-9/11 strategy? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Absolutely. You know, it's interesting - Donald Rumsfeld tried this kind of strategy 10 years ago. He wanted to focus more in the Pacific, wanted to have more of a high-tech military with fewer people, and that of course was overtaken by events. So they're going to try it one more time. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And if there's a headline here, it's that the Army is cut, and let's focus on the Pacific. That's sort of the headline. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And post-Iraq, well, the strategy that the United States adopted in Iraq and later in Afghanistan, counterinsurgency, that's - well, that's been scrubbed. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : It has, and frankly it's the only thing in the strategy that military says we won't be able to do anymore. Here's a quote from the strategy, quote: \"U.S. forces will no longer be sized to conduct large-scale, prolonged stability operations.\" They're basically what we did in Afghanistan, what we did in Iraq, we're not going to do that anymore, we're going to do other things. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And other than that, they pretty much say they can do everything else, right across the board. And it's interesting; they want to have it both ways. They want to say, listen, it's still a strong military, it's the strongest in the world, we can do all these things and cut it by half a trillion dollars over the next decade. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So you're going to have a lot of people on Capitol Hill say wait a minute, if you can cut half a trillion dollars and still do pretty much everything, why not cut more? And the Republicans, of course, and John McCain has already started talking about this a bit, saying listen, you know, we're not sure about this strategy, we think it weakens the Pentagon. So look for those arguments in the coming weeks. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, one of those big arguments is going to revolve around the two-war commitment. The previous strategies all emphasized the ability of the United States - this is the post-Cold War strategy - to be able to fight two major regional conflicts and win at the same time. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Right, and they're kind of fuzzy on that too. If you look at the fine print in the strategy, it basically says we can fight and win against an aggressor in one theater and then in another theater, you know, fight and kind of hold off this aggressor, kind of make sure that, you know, they don't win their - whatever it is, their war or whatever. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And - but when we asked Defense Secretary Leon Panetta about it, he basically said, hey, listen, we can do more than one thing at once. So they want to kind of have it both ways, I think. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And these are all sort of theoretical, but the examples that were always given is: Could we deal with North Korea and Iran simultaneously? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : He is saying yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And he is saying yes. Now, North Korea and Iran may seem like more immediate subjects of U.S. military interest, but clearly the long-term outlook here is China. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly, they're worried about China's military increases. They're worried about, you know, China buying aircraft carriers and more aircraft, war planes and so forth. What are the intentions of China? And they're saying their growing military strength could cause regional friction that could hamper U.S. national security and also the U.S. economy. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So there's going to be a big push in the Pacific region basically, you know, setting up maybe more bases like we've seen in Australia; more Marines are heading that way. More exercises with certain countries in the Pacific - you know, military exchange. You'll see a lot of that in the coming years under this strategy. \n\n ###",

That means more Navy, more Air Force. With fewer troops needed for places like Iraq and Afghanistan, much less for the Army. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly. The Army will be the big bill payer here. There was a sense the Army would be cut from maybe 560,000 troops to maybe 520. Now it looks like they may go down to 490,000 troops in the Army when the smoke clears in all of this. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And you're right, the investments are going to be more in the Navy and the Air Force in the coming years under this strategy. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There are other tasks that the United States does almost as a matter of routine, and it's hard to think of it that way, but global communications, military communications. Those global positioning satellites, those are military satellites. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The Navy has been the predominate blue-water force, ensuring freedom of navigation through the seven seas since 1945. None of that is going to change. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Absolutely not, and there will be a lot more money on those ISR intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance efforts and drone aircraft and also special operations forces. They want to continue to beef up the Navy SEALs, the Green Berets for the kind of fights in the future, training foreign militaries and also if need be to go in and do what they call direct action. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The United States has been drawing down forces in Europe steadily all through the years, especially since the end of the Cold War, obviously. Is that going to continue? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Yes, you will see more draw-downs in Europe as they move towards this Pacific-Asia strategy. We don't know the numbers yet. That'll all come out in the budget next month. But clearly more reductions in Europe. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to get listeners involved in this conversation. As the United States military decides on what it needs to be able to do - well, what does it need to be able to do? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Vance(ph), we'll start with Vance, and Vance is with us from Flagstaff. VANCE : Hi, thanks for taking my call. I'm a former member of the National Guard. I've seen, you know, kind of how the military operates from the inside. But I believe the core mission of the military is to protect the United States, its nations and its interests abroad, and not to provide jobs or even to provide indirect economic aid to other countries. VANCE : So if you can provide that mission, I think they're right on target of saying let's decide what the mission is, what do we need to accomplish, not start with the cuts but start with the needs. VANCE : And we spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year just to maintain overseas bases, not even counting the actions those bases take. So to me it's, yeah, you protect the nation, you protect the people, you protect the security interests of the nation abroad, and everything beyond that is extraneous. And I'll take my comments off the air. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Just one clarification, Vance, when you say it's not to provide jobs, do you mean provide jobs in, for example, the U.S. Army or provide jobs for contractors building high-tech weapons? VANCE : I would say either way, and I mean, you're getting into an issue there of systemic change and that as long - we have a current military industrial complex, you know, we'd be foolish to think that that doesn't affect policy, is the money that's made. VANCE : And, you know, the more we go to more, the more these costs - the more we go to war, the more these contractors make. But also, you know, I've heard it say, you know, if you reduce the size of the military, then you're cutting jobs, but I think it's important to remember that the mission of the military is not to be an employer, it's the mission of the private sector to provide jobs. The mission of the military is protect the country and its interests. VANCE : And that needs to be the focus, and if you can do it with a smaller military, I think that's the only responsible thing to do. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Vance, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it. And Tom Bowman, we've already talked about the reductions, principally in the U.S. Army, that are going to be paying for a lot of these cuts. What about the high-tech and those military industrial issues that Vance was talking about? And you go immediately to the biggest, most expensive weapon system ever in the United States military, the F-35. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : That's right. Well, the sense is they will cut back on the number of F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, they will buy. And again, we don't have a number on that yet. That'll come out next month in the budget. But clearly not only cutting the number of Army troops, they'll be cutting across the board, and a lot of these programs, very expensive, high-tech programs. But at this point we don't have a real firm figure on that yet. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And Vance, of course, being a member of the National Guard, it's interesting in the strategy, they're trying to figure out how much mix do they want between active-duty people and National Guard and Reserve people. You could see, in the coming years, a larger role for the National Guard and Reserve as they cut down on the active force. If need be, for whatever reason, they could call National Guard and Reserve to active duty, the president could. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And they're putting that in the strategy here as an important part of this. \n\n ###",

There were rampant drug problems. There was an all-draft army, not all-draft but largely a draftee army. It was fundamentally remade. This is what Colin Powell and that generation of military officers spent their lives doing into the force that ended up being in Europe, the force that fought the first Gulf War, the force that we have today, a very different military. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But the National Guard, after Vietnam, the whole military was restructured so that we could never again fight a war without the National Guard. And there are vital tasks that you cannot accomplish in the U.S. military today - the air-to-air refueling that's vital to long-range military operations of any sort. It sounds unglamorous - the National Guard does a huge amount of that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Those sorts of tasks are going to be built in even more, so more National Guardsmen are going to be away for longer periods of time? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : It's possible. And again, they're talking about what kind of a mix do we want here. How many - what kind of jobs do we want on active duty? What kind of jobs do we want in the Guard and Reserve? And they're looking at clearly calling upon the Guard and Reserve much more in the future under this strategy. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And the interesting thing about the Guard and Reserve over the past 10 years, these folks have more combat experience than at any time since World War II, all the time they spent over in Iraq and Afghanistan. So they want to basically, you know, jump on the trained Guard people and their experience and make sure they can use that in the future. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Email from David in Fremont, New Hampshire: As a veteran I've been dismayed by the long-term nation-building mission of U.S. forces. Using our troops for fixing up schools and bridges in Iraq while U.S. infrastructure is neglected is just insane. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Our fighting forces should be used for fighting and only when absolutely necessary. I'm glad the president is downsizing the military. And is there any clamor for saying we've just spent enormous amounts of money and time and effort to develop this capability - why are we throwing it away? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, they're not really throwing it away. I mean, there's still going to be a pretty good-sized military out there. You know, the Army's going to not quite go back to what it was in the late '90s, when it was roughly 480,000. The lowest number would be 490,000. So there's still quite a few people in the Army. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : The Marine Corps will be cut back a bit but probably not as much as people initially thought. So there's still a pretty good-size military out there. And again, with the Guard and Reserve, that gives you a lot more to work with. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we'll still be spending more than the rest of the world combined. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Absolutely. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking about the president's plan to reshape the military.

Because that mostly seems completely pointless to me. And otherwise, the question was: What do we want the military to focus on? And I'd say get entirely out of the Indian Ocean. And if, you know, the Pacific is where things are happening, well, that doesn't mean increase the Pacific. I mean, just use the remaining resources on the Pacific. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, Nathan, thanks very much. The nuclear deterrence, Tom Bowman, that's set pretty much by the agreements with Russia - excuse me, going back to the old days - and that's unlikely to change as a result of this budget. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, they are saying in the strategy that it is possible that our deterrence goals can be achieved with a smaller nuclear force. And they're calling for a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in the inventory. So clearly they're looking at some cost savings there. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : I don't have a figure right now of exactly how much we spent on nuclear capability, but they're looking at reducing that. And as far as the Indian Ocean, we had that carrier there, the John Stennis, which picked up the Iranian fishermen who were being held captive by pirates. \n\n ###",

So that's not going to end anytime soon. The sense is they'll, of course, turn over responsibility to the Afghans at the end of 2014. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So it's unlikely you're going to see anyone leave the Arabian Sea before then. They're going to always have a carrier there doing flight operations from the Arabian Sea. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There's also the U.S. operations in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa there. That's important for operating drones, for example, on places like Yemen and Somalia. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Absolutely. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the base at Diego Garcia, the depopulated atoll almost nowhere in the middle of the Indian Ocean that's used for any number of purposes, refueling for one thing, to get to the Persian Gulf. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Right, including B-52 bombers where they're - you know, during some of the wars of the past decade, as well. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Email from Joe(ph): Will cyberintelligence be expanded? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Yes, they make a great point in this strategy of beefing up cyber-capability. And of course, China is quite well-versed on this. And that's one of the concerns they have about China is that China's working cyberwarfare issues quite a bit over the past number of years. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So that's when you get into some of the high-tech things they'll be doing in the future, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, drones, et cetera. Cyberwarfare is a big part of that, as well. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can go next to - this is Michael(ph), Michael with us from Gainesville. MICHAEL : Good afternoon, gentlemen, appreciate the conversation. I would like to compliment that the discussion on the Pentagon budget is open finally. It's been a while before - that it's been so well-protected. By my question would be: Since this conversation is open now, why not look at some of the revenue that providing defense should be able to provide? MICHAEL : For example, it's understood out there that the subsidy for gasoline is $1 a gallon to protect the shipping lanes. Why not have some kind of a tax on shippers - I know it would get passed through to the consumer - but some kind of a tax to provide some revenue for the Navy? Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Way to get some income out of this. I'm not sure how exactly that would work, Tom Bowman, but... TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, I mean, one of the concerns in the military is that the military is being the policeman of the world and providing safe passage for all the oil that's being sent all around the world, everywhere from Europe to China. So maybe that's something they can consider at the Pentagon or on Capitol Hill to come up with a little money to fund the Pentagon budget. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A Strait of Hormuz tax, perhaps. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly right, a little toll booth there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Kenneth(ph), Kenneth with us from San Rafael in California. KENNETH : Hi, I think that the idea of the mission all over the world is: A, ridiculous; B, we are part of an international community, and we do not have to be the policeman of the world. I think our core mission is to protect the territory of the U.S., the airspace of the U.S. and to help some allies who really functionally can't. KENNETH : But in this day and age, there aren't any allies who functionally can't take care of themselves. I think this whole thing is a huge rip-off of the American people. We have fought so many wars since World War II that were totally unnecessary, and it really is disgusting to hear this conversation go in the direction we're going without looking at the basic premise of what do we really have to do, what are our real threats. KENNETH : North Korea isn't a real threat. It's not going anywhere. It's not going to bomb anybody. It'll make a lot of noise. It's not - the place could be leveled within a couple of hours with the push of a couple of computer buttons to, you know, four feet above the ground. That's true of Iran, as well. \n\n ###",

China's winning the economic war, and that's the war we have to be playing. When we throw $800 billion literally out the window, we're going to go down the way, you know, Rome went down. And it's disgusting that we don't open the conversation this far. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call, Kenneth. And I have to say, of those running for president, Ron Paul, the former Libertarian candidate, is one person who might echo some of the things that Kenneth has said. But for the most part, Tom, as you look in Congress, they're talking about marginal cuts, maybe double is the biggest number I've heard, of the half-trillion that the president has already proposed, doubling that but nothing beyond that. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : No, I don't think so. And what Kenneth raises, you know, that sentiment clearly is out there and growing, that with the economy the way it is now, with so many unemployed, the amount of money being spent in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, people are saying what are we doing it for. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : And he raises a very good point about China. While the U.S. has been fighting for the past decade, China's been running around the world buying up a lot of real estate, you know... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oil rights, among other things. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Oil rights and also, as many people maybe don't know, they have a copper mine they're working in Afghanistan right now while the U.S. is fighting there. China is trying to make a little bit of money. So that's a huge concern that people in the Pentagon have an elsewhere in the United States, that China's been - is the greatest beneficiary of the U.S. focus on counterinsurgency fights during the past decade. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Then there are countries like Vietnam, Borneo, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, all of whom very concerned about China - throw Australia and New Zealand in there, as well - and its claims to a huge expanse of the South China Sea. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly, and that's one of the concerns in the Pentagon is what is China looking for, what is their game plan. And as it mentions in the strategy here, there could be regional friction in the coming years. It could affect U.S. economy or U.S. national security, and you're right. I mean, is - do they consider the South China Sea sort of their lake, so to speak? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yes, they do. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So that's clearly going to be concern with some of the U.S. allies, some of the U.S. friends and so forth and people the U.S. is trying to work with in the future. So again, that's why the focus is in the Pacific. What are China's aims? Where are they heading? Are they going to be an ally, a rival or, you know, maybe a little bit of both? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to - this is David, David with us from Fresno. DAVID : Hello, yes, I believe that the danger of spending so much on military is that it makes our country less secure. Because we have these military capabilities, we don't really push the diplomatic option. Instead, we almost always resolve problems militarily. We could do more diplomatically with Iran to get them to stop building their nuclear weapons. DAVID : And even if they did, our own military tells us that in the past, we've dealt with countries - Russia and China - that were far more capable militarily, and we were able to negotiate with them, deal with them diplomatically. By having this large military, we're roaming around on the other side of the globe, in China's backyard. We're basically antagonizing them. DAVID : So if a war ever breaks out between the U.S. and China, it'll largely be because we're meddling in other people's backyard. And the Soviets have done the same - or not the Soviets, forgive me, the Russians... NEAL CONAN, HOST : I made the same mistake earlier, David, don't worry about it. DAVID : The Russians have brought up the same issue. You know, we finished the Cold War, we naive citizens were hoping that we'd be able to get along with the Russians, and what do we do? We put a missile defense system or propose to right in their backyard with the bogus notion that it was going to be aimed against Iran. DAVID : Of course the Russians aren't stupid. They know it's aimed against them. And the reason we do all these things... NEAL CONAN, HOST : David, I do have to stop you - I do have to stop you there. The missile defense system that was proposed for Eastern Europe was clearly not aimed at Russia. It was not capable of putting any serious dent in any kind of Russian launch and was never intended to do that. It was aimed at Iran. Whether that was a wise decision or not, well, that's debatable. But getting back to the point, he does make the broader point, Tom. If you've got a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. There is that aspect to it. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly. And that's been a problem for a long time, maybe since the 1950s or so. When you put so much more money in the Pentagon as opposed to the State Department and you look at something like U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Information Agency, USIA, went away - the United States Agency for International Development is a shadow of what it used to be. They're all - it's basically a contracting agency now. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : So former Defense Secretary Bob Gates would talk about this that, you know, you need more people in the State Department. You can't just do everything militarily. That's a real concern out there, even in the Pentagon. \n\n ###",

We need to rely less on military means and more on diplomatic skills, develop and rely for that on jobs. And again, those budgets are coming down. This email from Teresa(ph) in Alabama. Please clarify for me, are we talking about real cuts in the planned long-range expenses or just cuts in the planned growth of the budget? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, initially, the - it would go down - the budget would go down, and then over the years, it would only rise by inflation. So in some respects, it is sort of - the budget will still rise by inflation. It just won't rise as much as it did in the past. So it is a little bit of semantics here about cutbacks. The real test will be, I think, what happens with the sequestration. Will the Pentagon have to double those cuts? If Congress - as it stands now... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sequestration is what happens if, as a result of the failure of the budget process at the end of last year, there are supposed to be automatic budget cuts imposed by this time, I guess, next year... TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Exactly. A year from now, those cuts would go into effect. So you would double those reductions in Pentagon spending this time next year, unless Congress somehow sidetracks that. But here's the other thing, Neal. We were talking about this earlier. If the Pentagon is saying we can pretty much do everything we can - we're doing now with a half trillion dollars in cuts, you're going to see a number of people, liberal Democrats on the Hill, maybe Tea Party people, saying, wait a minute, if you guys can pretty much do everything you want to do now, let's just keep cutting - cut 100, 200 billion more, and we'll see what happens. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman about the new strategy that President Obama unveiled in an unusual visit to the Pentagon last week. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's see if we go to Lucas(ph). Lucas on the line from San Antonio. LUCAS : Hi there. Thanks for having me. I've got a couple of quick questions. Then, I'll take my questions off the air - answers off the air. But I really wanted to question your panel here about the importance of dealing with China strategically and really keeping in mind what their goals are. I think there are a lot of misconceptions about China's expansionist ideals. But in fact, when you're actually looking at it, they're only trying to reassert what were traditionally their borders during the imperial dynasties. LUCAS : And I think keeping in mind that, while we're refocusing our resources, it would be really important then, so what would be the best strategy for doing that? And also why do we keep focusing on the Middle East? It seems like - I mean, my entire life, we've been at war there, and the resources there - my brother is right there now fighting. You know, it seems like a massive waste of resources. Someone who's got a bachelor's of science in economics and speaks Mandarin, his wife is Chinese, I just think, you know, that's where we need to be. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Lucas, China - you're correct - believes that reclaiming the borders from its imperial days that has been tough on people in places like Tibet but also it's debatable whether the Chinese empire ever really did incorporate the entire - all the waters of the South China Seas. In any case, that's open to dispute from any number of other countries. But the question about the Middle East, Tom, and we say we're drawing down from there, clearly, the removal of troops from Iraq, that doesn't suggest there aren't tens of thousands of troops in the Persian Gulf, that there's not a continuing military commitment, the 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, and, yeah, last week, we heard Iranian generals say don't come back into the Persian Gulf, John Stennis, but it's going back or it - or a replacement is going back. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, clearly, 40 percent of the world's oil comes through the Strait of Hormuz. I mean, that's a big reason why we're in the region. We have to get that oil. We have to make sure the oil is available throughout the world. And also, it's an area of great instability. Pakistan, with its nuclear weapons, is a real worry about if that becomes a failed state. That's the big reason why we're in Afghanistan, to keep an eye on Pakistan and make sure things don't go south in that area. You know, Israel is a strong ally of the United States, another reason we're interested in the region. But number one, clearly, is oil. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This email from Michael. Tom, have you read anything to the effect of the armed forces, especially the Navy, being used and enhanced in ecocatastrophic responses as part of a global climate change - storms, quakes, tsunami et cetera. I know the military has been ahead of the American public in acknowledging the destabilizing potential of climate change and had it in planning documents. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : They have been talking about that more and more in the past number of years. It could be - well, this is all wrapped into population growth, coastal cities becoming much larger, potential for instability. The Marines, U.S. Marines in particular, were helpful in the tsunami episode and so forth. So... NEAL CONAN, HOST : In Japan, yes. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : In Japan. And so clearly, they're looking at that as a concern in the coming years and having to go in and do humanitarian operations and so forth. That's a big selling point for the Marine Corps now that, basically, we can do it all. We can fight wars, and we can be there for humanitarian disasters. But as far as climate change, everyone in the Pentagon is talking about that as a real concern for problems in the future. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I guess, the Navy played an important role in the first days in Haiti, a couple of years ago as well, but to say that the Navy or Marine Corps exists to work - help out in ecodisasters is, well, it's an expensive way to do it. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Right. Or the Marines can say we can do it all... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : ...everything from humanitarian up to wars. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So, Tom Bowman, thanks very much for your time today, and we'll look forward to this as the numbers come out, the devil always in the details most of the time. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Absolutely. NEAL CONAN, HOST : NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman here with us in Studio 3A. \n\n ###",

I'm Ira Flatow. As the song goes, look around, leaves are brown and the sky is a hazy shade of winter. But why? Why do the days get shorter, it gets colder, plants go dormant, animals migrate or hibernate, the constellations change in the sky? IRA FLATOW, HOST : If you've ever wondered about how winter works, give us a call. For what you can see in the skies to what you can spot in your own backyard gardens, we're here to help you see and enjoy the winter wonderland, answer your questions, maybe even make you enjoy it more by knowing more, as Richard Feynman used to talk about. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Our number, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Our guests are - let me introduce them - Dr. Andrew Fraknoi, he is no stranger to SCIENCE FRIDAY. He's a professor of Astronomy at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. He's at KQED in San Francisco. Welcome back, Andrew. ANDREW FRAKNOI : Nice to be with you again. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And I saw Orion out for the first time a few weeks ago. I was very happy to see that winter was back. ANDREW FRAKNOI : It's true. This is a wonderful time for stargazers. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, we'll talk more about that. Paul Yeager is a writer and meteorologist and author of the book \"Weather Whys: Facts, Myths, and Oddities,\" published by Perigee Books. He joins us from State College, Pennsylvania. Welcome, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. PAUL YEAGER : Good afternoon, how are you? IRA FLATOW, HOST : You're welcome, thanks for joining us. PAUL YEAGER : I'm glad to be here. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So are we. David Mizejewski is a naturalist with the National Wildlife Federation, he's at our headquarters, based at their headquarters in Reston, Virginia. He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Thanks for having me. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Andrew, let me go back to winter. You know, most people have - I talk about this, there have been studies of Harvard graduate students. Why is it hotter in the summer or colder in the winter? And so many people have no idea, do they? They all get it wrong. ANDREW FRAKNOI : That's correct. In fact most Americans believe that it's distance from the sun that gives us the hotter and colder days. And actually it's very interesting, because yesterday was what we astronomers call perihelion day, when we were actually closest to the sun, and yet it's winter. So it clearly can't be the distance from the sun that controls the seasons, and we know that in fact the reason for the seasons is that the Earth is tilted. ANDREW FRAKNOI : Like an accident victim whose back is injured and who can't stand up straight, the Earth had an accident many billions of years ago, and the result is that the Earth's axis is permanently tilted, and we go around the sun leaning over. And it's that lean in the Earth that causes the sunlight to differ in the summer and in the winter, that gives us the more spread-out sunlight and gives us the shorter days that characterize our winters in the Northern Hemisphere. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's talk about - you talked about the perihelion. What is the solstice? That sort of confuses people, too, doesn't it? ANDREW FRAKNOI : Well, that's right, so perihelion means closest to the sun, and solstice is the time when we have the shortest day and the longest night. We had our solstice in December, on December 21, 22, and that's the time when, because of the Earth's axis leaning, we get the longest period of time when we're in darkness and the shortest period of time that we're in the day. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. Paul Yeager, now that we know the difference between and why we have winter versus summer with the planets and the sunfall, what difference in incoming energy accounts for everything we think of as, like, winter weather? PAUL YEAGER : Oh, it makes a huge difference, and everything that Andrew just talked about plays into why cold air breeds during the time of year when the sun is tilted away from the Earth on that particular axis. So right now, the Earth is tilted in such a way that there's almost complete darkness in the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere, perfect breeding ground for cold air. PAUL YEAGER : More energy from the Earth escapes from the Earth than comes in. Therefore, it gets colder, promotes more snow cover. The more snow cover, the colder the ground is, the more the heat goes away, and also the sun - I mean, the snow on the ground also reflects the sunshine away from the Earth, also promoting it to get cold. \n\n ###",

PAUL YEAGER : Well, yeah, so far this year what's been happening is that we sort of have a northern branch of the jet stream and a southern branch of the jet stream, and the northern branch is the one that's responsible for bringing the cold air southward, and that has stayed pretty far to the north so far this winter season, and it's kept the cold air locked in more across Canada than it has been able to come southward in the United States. IRA FLATOW, HOST : David Mizejewski, people often say oh, winter's so depressing, you look outside, everything is dead, but that's far from the case, is it not? DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : That's absolutely far from the case. You know, in fact winter for me is one of my favorite seasons. You know, one of the coolest things about winter is that there are no leaves, at least not on the deciduous trees, and that makes opportunities to get outside and observe nature, you know, so much greater than maybe in the warm seasons. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : You know, you can go bird-watching. You can look for tracks in the snow or even in the mud if there's no snow on the ground, and you just have a much bigger chance of actually getting to see something. And at National Wildlife Federation, that's one of our things that we try to get people to do is actually go outside. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : And so winter can be a really great time. You know, you just - if it's cold out, bundle up, head outside. There's tons of great field guides. And if you just observe, you're going to experience some really cool things that you wouldn't get to see otherwise. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Andrew Fraknoi, I mentioned my favorite constellation, Orion, is showing up in the winter. Why do these different constellations have seasons to them? ANDREW FRAKNOI : Well, we see, as we go around the sun, we see different constellations at different time of the year. And winter is really good from an astronomer's point of view because we have these long nights, and so you have more of an opportunity, as long as it's not snowing or cloudy, to take a look at the brilliant winter sky. ANDREW FRAKNOI : And you point out probably my favorite constellation, too, which is the constellation of Orion, pretty easy to find because there are two very bright stars that define the shoulder and the leg of this great hunter named Orion from ancient legend. ANDREW FRAKNOI : And then there are three bright stars that make up a belt, and that's pretty easy to spot. And then you can see the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, if you follow the belt along toward the left, and that's a pretty spectacular constellation or star grouping that almost everyone can find if you're looking in the winter sky. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get some phone calls in here from lots of inquisitive people. Carl(ph) in Buffalo, New York, hi, Carl. CARL : Hello, hello, great show as always. Everybody loves the weekend for certain reasons, obviously, but I like it because of SCIENCE FRIDAY. I look forward to the show every week. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thank you. CARL : So keep up the great work. Two things: There's a strange phenomenon that happens in Buffalo, New York, surrounded by Lake Erie. In the summer, clouds are like any other city, they're overhead, they're everywhere. But in the winter, they surround the city, a real thick cloud just surrounds the perimeter of the city. It's only maybe about 10 degrees above the horizon. It's a very strange phenomena. I was wondering if you knew the answer to that. CARL : And also one more quick question, the back-to-back La Ninas, why is this year's La Nina so much different than last year's? IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right, Carl, thanks for calling from Buffalo, always has a special place in my heart. Paul, got any answer for that? PAUL YEAGER : Well, I'm guessing the clouds have to do with the difference in the temperatures of the lake. During the summertime, the lake is cool relative to the air masses around it, and during the winter, the water is, until it freezes, relatively warm compared to the air masses around it, and that probably is what makes a difference in where the clouds form, just as it makes a difference in when you get lake-effect snow and things like that. PAUL YEAGER : And as far as the La Nina, you're absolutely right. There is a La Nina this winter, and there was a La Nina last winter, but the two winters have so far been dramatically different. And one of the reasons for that is, you know, La Nina and El Nino are two things that are often talked about by meteorologists and by the general public because they're pretty well-understood. PAUL YEAGER : They affect the climate pretty dramatically in a given year. So they tend to be the first things we think of. However, there are other atmospheric phenomena that can supersede a La Nina or an El Nino in a given year. And this year compared to last year, there has not been as much of a negative phase of what's called the Arctic oscillation, which is something that allows that cold air to come southward out of Canada very effectively in the eastern United States. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Lots of folks want to ask good questions, like Cathy(ph) in North Carolina. Hi, Cathy. \n\n ###",

PAUL YEAGER : There is a bit of a delay in what happens, you know, when you get the lack of sunshine for - until the atmosphere actually cools, so its coolest point is like a one-month delay. It is the same thing when you're at your maximum amount of sun coming in during the summer. There's like a month delay until the atmosphere warms to its warmest. So there is always a little bit of a lag with your normal temperatures being a month behind, you know, the astronomical phenomena. ANDREW FRAKNOI : Ira, if I can add... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Go ahead, please. CATHY : OK, though, can I possibly (unintelligible) question... ANDREW FRAKNOI : Did you experience the same thing... IRA FLATOW, HOST : What's that? ANDREW FRAKNOI : Hold on one sec. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hang on. Let Andrew finish up the answer. CATHY : Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. ANDREW FRAKNOI : So the - you notice the same thing in your swimming pool, right, that your swimming pool doesn't heat up right away. Much of the Earth's surface is made of water, and it takes a while for the heat to be lost in winter and to be gained in the summer. We call this the seasonal lag, and that's why you'll notice that the hottest days of the summer are not at the summer solstice, but a month or two after that. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, that's why Buffalo is getting all that snow because the warm water is all evaporating. Its cold air just over it and pounds it. Yeah, I'm sorry, Cathy, you wanted to say something else? CATHY : Yeah, just one other quick question. I'm up in the mountains in the northwestern North Carolina. And we have an interesting little phenomenon here that in the winter, we'd had next to no snow this year so far. But when we do get snow, sometimes there will be not a cloud to be seen, but there's still snow coming down, just a very fine snow, but there's - you look up in the sky and there ain't no clouds up there. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So is it like sort of a fine, misty snow or... CATHY : Just a very fine, so fine snow. And you're kind of looking around and it's not windy, and you're saying, well, OK, where is this coming from. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Paul, do you have a suggestion for that? PAUL YEAGER : Well, you know, you usually - to have official snow falling from the sky, you are going to need to have some form of clouds. You know, what might be happening is it could be some version of a fog that's kind of freezing into ice crystals close to the ground. You know, you might be able to see the sun through something like that. But, you know, for you to have real snow falling that's accumulating an inch at a time, something like that, you would need to have, you know, legitimate cloud. \n\n ###",

CATHY : No - OK, thanks. Bye-bye. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Take care. Did you want to jump in there, say something? Whom did I interrupt? No one, I guess. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. we're talking about what goes on in the wintertime. And we're talking about snow. And another thing people think about when they think about winter, Dave, is animal hibernation. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : That's right, yeah. And, you know, the whole idea of what wildlife does in the winter is actually really tied to what we were just talking about, and that is not necessarily temperature. I think a lot of people think, oh, it's getting cold, you know, so the trees are losing their leaves and, you know, the birds are flying South, and the bears are going into their winter sleep. It really has a lot more to do with photoperiod, with the amount of light. That really is the trigger in the behavior of these living organisms. And it's kind of neat to think about the fact that, you know, these plants and animals that live on the surface of the planet, along with us that we see every day really are being influenced by, you know, by the much bigger, you know, what goes on with the sun and the axis of the Earth and everything. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : And it's a macro way of think about all this. But, yeah, hibernation or winter torpor is something that a lot of species do, and it's just their mechanism of surviving the fact that there is a lot less sunlight, which means that plants can't photosynthesize as much, if at all. And that means that that there's a lot less food at the bottom of the food chain for the, you know, the smaller animals and the herbivores to actually, you know, eat and then higher up the food chain, the predatory, carnivorous animals don't have anything to eat. So what a lot of animals do is they just sleep it off. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Sleep it off. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Bears will go into dens. They don't do a true hibernation. Their body temperature doesn't get really low like the true hibernators, like, some of the ground squirrels or the bats or reptiles and amphibians. But they pretty much, you know, they sleep away those cold, lean times. And when the sunlight - the amounts of sunlight start increasing and the plants are able to photosynthesize and the insects wake up and start reproducing. And again from that base of the food chain, the animals that sleep through the winter wake back up. Similarly, another strategy for survival is migration. You know, everybody knows that birds migrate south for the winter. And not all birds do, obviously, but a lot of other creatures do too, including butterflies - monarch butterflies make an immense migration from, you know, as far north as southern Canada, all the way down into Mexico every year. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Let me just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR, and talking about things to see in the wintertime with Andrew Fraknoi, Paul Yeager and David... DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Mizejewski. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thank you. Mizejewski. Somebody says, how do I get these names right. You see, I don't. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Lots of people are talking about the winter, let's - in the couple of minutes before the break, let's go to someone who knows a lot about winter. Mary in Fairbanks. Hi, Mary. MARY : Hi, Ira. Thanks for the great program. I had to call in today. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Tell us, do you like the winter in Fairbanks? MARY : Winter is my favorite season. I've lived here for 47 years, and I celebrate the summer solstice because it's starting to get darker and darker and darker and winter is coming. And then by about November, December, we really have much shorter days, about four hours of daylight. But I've learned that you have to live with nature, not try to fight nature. And I've - my strategy for survival is just to adapt to the change and enjoy a more introspective time where life can slow down a little bit, and you can take the time to think about things and read more. And it is a feeling of denning up and then one that - right now, it's getting light about quarter to 9. There's some light in the sky, and you just want to get out in the middle of the day and do things and then stay inside when it's real cold and be comfortable. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So it doesn't depress you at all, all that darkness? MARY : As long as I can get outside for a couple hours a day, when it is light. That's what I need. And I taught school one year and it drove me crazy because I had to be inside all day long, and I learned that that wasn't the job for me, so I work seven days a week in the summer, and then in the winter I'm more in charge of my time, and I can just go out in the middle of the day and get a good dose of sunshine and enjoy winter. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. What a very nice way to look at it. MARY : Well, it's - it rules here, and it's a major long season up here. So if you don't like winter, you shouldn't live in Fairbanks, but I love both Fairbanks and the winter. IRA FLATOW, HOST : All right. Thank you very much, and have a joyous winter. MARY : Thank you very much. I feel blessed to be here. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thank you for calling. No better call, then, to go to our break. We're going to come back and - after this break and talk lots more about winter with Andrew Fraknoi - he's professor of astronomy at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California - Paul Yeager, author of \"Weather Whys: Facts, Myths, and Oddities,\" and David Mizejewski. He is a naturalist with the National Wildlife Federation. Our number: 1-800-989-8255.

Send your photos in, and we'll pick a winner by next week and announce it on next week's program. IRA FLATOW, HOST : In the meantime, we're going to still be talking about winter. My guests are Andrew Fraknoi, Paul Yeager and David Mizejewski. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Let's talk some questions here before we go to the phones. You know, all the time - and I'll just throw this out to the - to general discussion here - if you're from the North like I am and you go to Southern states or other parts in the South, you're wondering, what's winter like to the plants and the animals here? Do they actually experience a seasonal change? DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Well, yeah. I mean, the - there's a lot of species that have wide range and are found, you know, in the North, to use the U.S., for example, and the Northeast as well and the Southeast. And, you know, sort of the different populations follow the rhythms of nature, right? And so the winters in the Deep South don't get as bad as the winters further North. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : And so, for example, you know, to use the bear winter dormancy example, you know, bears might be active a lot longer into the year. And in some places, maybe they don't even go dormant, whereas further North - where, you know, it's darker, the winters are more harsh - maybe they're going to go into dormancy earlier. You also see different species living in those different areas for that exact reason. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : You know, there are certain species that can't tolerate a - an extremely cold winter. And so their populations only get as far North as the upper, you know, South or maybe into the Mid-Atlantic. So there's various strategies that living creatures have evolved over thousands and millions of years to survive and kind of, you know, kind of be in this rhythm with what's going on with the axis of the planet and the weather and the seasons and the climate. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let's go to Ramona(ph) in Norwich, Connecticut. Hi there. RAMONA : Hi. How are you, gentlemen? IRA FLATOW, HOST : Hi there. RAMONA : I have a question. I live in the suburban part of Connecticut, and deer often come and eat off my apple trees towards the end of the summer. And, lately, they've been putting in new housing developments around me, and the deer seem to be shoved into the back of my two acres in the wood there. So they come into my yard and eat off my bird feeders. I've begun to be putting the bird food on the ground for them, and apples and pears and things like that. Is that necessarily a bad thing? DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Well, I'll take that one. You know, generally speaking, we don't recommend any kind of artificial feeding of wildlife beyond maybe putting out a bird feeder for seed-eating birds. You know, there's research out there that shows that the birds typically are only using that as a supplement to the natural food sources, which just highlights why it's important to keep native vegetation around because that's where the birds are getting their natural food sources. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : You know, here's the thing with white-tailed deer. You know, they might look like they're cold and they're suffering, but in the bigger picture in terms of their species, they're doing quite well, particularly in the Northeast. And while, you know, you might be tempted to want to go out and help them in the cold, they can survive just fine. And believe it or not, they do really well in suburbia. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : You know, this mix of woods and fields and lawns and gardens has actually allowed the white-tailed deer population to explode - that and the fact that we've killed off all the wolves and mountain lions in the Northeast. So it's generally considered not a good thing to artificially feed the deer. It could bolster their populations, and then in the summertime you get deer ticks and all that kind of thing. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Thanks for calling, Ramona. RAMONA : Thank you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : They're certainly doing OK, the deer on my block. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go back to Palmer, Alaska. Bill in Alaska, hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BILL : Yes. Good to hear from you - here anyway. I was just listening to the description of Fairbanks. Palmer is down by Anchorage near the ocean, so we get a lot more clouds and stuff. And so I call it five-and-a-half hours of twilight because the sun never rises in the east and it never rises in the west, except on an equinox. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### BILL : It goes around in a circle up here. And right now I'm looking out my window, and it's, oh, 15 degrees above the mountains, looking at me. So that's a little different. And one of the big deals I remember we used to do with the kids is star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. And that's sometime in September, because we haven't seen stars all summer long, or the moon. And that was kind of a fun thing. And then of course... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Wow. You know, we never think about that. BILL : Yeah. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Ira, this leads to a more general issue, which I think our listeners will be interested to think about, which is that the seasons are not the same in different parts of the world. We in the United States take things so much for granted, that what we get is what everyone gets. But, for example, right now, when we're having the winter in the Northern Hemisphere, they're having summer in the Southern Hemisphere. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : This is summer vacation time. So - and in the same way, as our listener said, sometimes you get these perpetual days of night, where you don't get any daylight at all at high latitudes, or you might get perpetual nighttime or perpetual daytime, depending on where you are, north or south. So this whole idea that our seasons are the only way to be, that's a good thing to get out of your mind and to imagine that there are many ways that people perceive and experience the seasons all around the planet. BILL : Yes. And that's the problem here psychologically, because if you go by the sun, you've still got another month and a half of so-called spring or something, you know, because the seasons don't change with the angle of the sun like they do in the in the South 48, and that is a noticeable difference if you let it bother you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You know, Bill - but you have used - you have something in the Northern states and parts of the country and the globe have something that I have never seen that I'd love to see, and you see it more in the winter, and that is the aurora, right? BILL : Oh, definitely. Definitely. Yeah. It'll stretch from the southern sky to the northern sky, sometimes the whole sky, and dance around and colorful. That's the best part of winter. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, yeah. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : That's beautiful... BILL : But we are noticing the climate change up here quite a bit, and we're getting more precipitation than we have in the last 20 years. Valdez, over there on the coast, is up to - their - they can get 500 inches of snow a year. But - and we've noticed, some of the articles I've read, the vegetation is moving into the tundra area, the (unintelligible) and small bushes and stuff, which they think is because of the warming of the tundra. BILL : The tundra, of course, is permafrost, and some of that's really - and you can spot it if you've looked at a place - a couple pictures where the brush - you know, three, four, five. That makes good (unintelligible). But - and then of course all the erosion along the northwest coast of Alaska that's wiping out the villages because the ice doesn't freeze up to protect them. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Not anymore in the winter. Thank you, Bill, for calling, and have a - and enjoy your winter. BILL : Thank you. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Take care. Yeah, and another thing that's not happening in winters or, as much as he says, they're not - they're getting more precipitation, and permafrost is not staying over as long as it used to. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Yeah. And I'd just to add to that, you know, that's a big issue. You know, climate change obviously is a big issue that National Wildlife Federation is working on and, you know, the scientific community is really watching because one of the things that we're anticipating is wildlife having to, you know, adapt or migrate to deal with the changes in their environment due to this bigger, you know, climate change. And you're seeing it already on the frontlines, you know, places like the tundra where some of the woody plants are moving northward. We're seeing it in the Arctic with the ice not lasting as long, and so therefore polar bears are suffering. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Grizzly bears are moving further north and maybe going to be competing with polar bears. Red foxes are moving north and probably going to be competing with arctic foxes. And so that's a big part of what's going on right now in anticipating and trying to deal with the issue of climate change when it comes to wildlife management. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Paul Yeager, let's talk a bit about snow, ice and the difference between different kinds of frozen water. Frost. How does frost form? Why do we get frost versus some - just ice particles? Or is it just ice forming on stuff? PAUL YEAGER : Well, you know, frost is not really a precipitation type. You know, frost is when the air cools to the point that the water inside of the air condenses, and it's cold enough on the blades of grass or, you know, the ground to actually freeze. It's something that occurs right at the ground level. And it usually happens on a clear night when the sky is clear and all of the heat from the day is escaping and the atmosphere gets nice and chilly and allows that condensation process to occur close to the earth. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Is it sort of like frozen dew? \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : Frozen. PAUL YEAGER : Exactly. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah. And is it true that there are no two snowflakes the same? PAUL YEAGER : You know, that's an interesting debate. And, you know, I would find it very hard to believe that, given a number of snowflakes that have fallen over the, you know, hundreds of millions of years of the life of the planet, there haven't been two that have been the same. You know, just in - you know, I've seen estimates that on a given winter, it's estimated - or a given year, calendar year, winter for both hemispheres, that there are one with 24 zeroes after it number of snowflakes that fall each year. PAUL YEAGER : And if you think about that many snowflakes kind of going through the same process to form, doing that year after year after year after year, you quickly get to the point where it's hard to believe that no two have been alike. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Mm-hmm. Andrew, let's talk a little bit about what celestial events we might look for and take advantage of the winter season. ANDREW FRAKNOI : Well, this is a great time for planets, Ira. If you go out right after sunset, Venus is in the west, and it's just super bright. So it will sort of knock you socks off astronomically. And if you go out January 26th, about an hour after sunset - put this on your social calendar. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'm writing. I'm writing. ANDREW FRAKNOI : Take someone with you with whom you'd like to sit in the dark. But January 26th, the crescent moon will be right above Venus about an hour after sunset. It'll be gorgeous. Then Jupiter is high in the sky if you look south when the night falls, and it's visible in the evening sky, also quite bright and easy to spot. And then Saturn rises in the east just before 1 a.m., and is halfway up the sky by dawn. So Saturn is a beautiful morning object. If you have a small telescope or binoculars, you can see the rings of Saturn. You can see four of the bright moons around Jupiter. So there are lots of opportunities for planet-gazing, as well as stargazing. But I wanted to go back because if I may, Ira, we haven't answered the original question. We haven't said why there's winter. I thought... IRA FLATOW, HOST : Let me just - before we do that, let me remind everybody who we are. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. And I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Andrew Fraknoi. Go ahead. Why there is winter. ANDREW FRAKNOI : And I'm sorry, but I wanted to get this thing there before we have to go. That - the reason that the Earth's axis is tilted is the real reason for the seasons. And we think that early on, there was a collision, maybe one, maybe more of smaller forming planets with the Earth, which knocked us over. And so our planet has this tilted axis and has all the phenomena that we've been talking about. But not every planet had an accident like this. Venus orbits with its head held straight up. It has no seasons. Jupiter orbits with its head held straight up, and it has no seasons. So although we love the seasons and we kind of accept it as part of life on Earth, it's not a cosmic requirement. Now, I'm sure we'll find many planets out there among other stars that have no sense of winter or summer or anything like seasons. IRA FLATOW, HOST : 1-800-989-8255. We've just got a couple of minutes left. Paul, do you have any other comments you'd like to contribute about what makes winter special? PAUL YEAGER : I think a lot of things make winter special, some of the things that we talked about. But, you know, personally, I love the snow. I think the snow is something that we can really learn to enjoy if we allow ourselves. We all had that innate love of the snow when we were young, and we would run around and play in the snow. But as we get older and a little bit more practical, we tend to stay more on the sidewalk than we do, you know, heading for the deepest snowdrift. And from that standpoint, I think that we could all learn to appreciate and love the weather because you're not going to change it. You might as well learn how to love it. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And, David Mizejewski, what are some of your favorite signs of winter, things that we can look for in nature? DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : Well, as I said earlier, I think one of the best things about winter is the fact that you can go out and you can see a lot more than you can in other seasons simply because, at least in the north, there's not as many leaves. So I think it's a great time to get the family together, turn off the TV, and just make that commitment to go outside, get that fresh air, get exercise and look for, say, last seasons birds' nests that are in the trees and the bushes that you didn't see before because they were hidden. Look for animal tracks if there's snow on the ground. Look up on the sky. That's a great time to watch for winter-resident birds - raptors, in particular. I love going hawk watching in the winter time because you can really spot, you know, the big red-tailed hawks and things like that. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : So, you know, the other thing that I think is a - winter's a great time of year for is planning your garden. You know, for those folks that just can't take the cold and they really just don't want to deal with it, one way to do, you know, have a good time in the winter is to plan out your spring garden. And, of course, at National Wildlife Federation we want folks to plan their wildlife - their gardens with wildlife in mind. So planting native stuff that's going to look great, but also naturally feed the birds and the other critters. So that's a good time of year to do it, is really right now in January. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Yeah, and this is in - traditionally, this has been the month where the garden seed catalogs start flooding in. DAVID MIZEJEWSKI : That's absolutely right, and there's a reason for it because, you know, people are - do get a little bit of cabin fever at this time of year, and they are dreaming of warmer of weather. So if you can't tolerate the cold and you don't want to get outside, you know, again, plan your springtime garden and, you know, bide it out - ride it out like some of the creatures that hibernate do. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I want to thank you all for taking time to be with us, and wish you all a very happy winter and a Happy New Year.

I'm Ira Flatow. The honeybee, as we've all heard, is in trouble: various fungus attacks, infestations of tiny mites in the hives and to top it off the mysterious ailment known as colony collapse disorder, in which the bees mysterious disappear from their hives. Now there is a new threat : A parasitic fly once thought to be only a problem to bumblebees has been found to be attacking honeybees as well and turning the honeybees into zombies. They leave the hive in a daze, they form into groups, just like the living dead do in the movies - except these bees eventually die. Now there is a new threat : Joining me now to talk about the find is John Hafernik, he's a professor of biology at San Francisco State University and co-author of a report on the find in the journal PLOS One. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JOHN HAFERNIK : Pleased to be here, Ira. IRA FLATOW, HOST : How did you discover this parasite? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, you know, a lot of people think that science is a carefully planned occupation where everything is thought out ahead of time. But this is really something that happened by accident. I'm not normally a honeybee researcher, but about three years ago now, I was walking into the biology building at San Francisco State, where I work every day, and I noticed that in front of the building, there were a number of honeybees that were laying on the sidewalk in front of the building. JOHN HAFERNIK : Some of them were walking around in circles, some were in kind of a bee fetal position, and I thought that was strange, but I also saw it as an opportunity. But not as an opportunity to do research, but an opportunity to feed a praying mantid that I'd brought back that weekend from a class field trip with my entomology class. JOHN HAFERNIK : So I scooped them up in a vial, brought it down to the mantid, fed the mantid the bees, and she loved them. And in fact, I did that daily then for several days. Eventually she produced a number of egg masses for us and was very happy eating the bees. JOHN HAFERNIK : But as luck would have it, one day I went up to my office first, on the fifth floor, and put the vial back onto my desk someplace, amongst the variety of papers - you can imagine my desk. And then left it there, forgot about it. Didn't notice it for another week or so, came back and the vial was filled with dead bees and maggots that were crawling out of them and some small brown pupae that were the pupae formed by those maggots. JOHN HAFERNIK : And that's when I knew there was something strange happening to these bees. IRA FLATOW, HOST : So the maggots, because they were in the vial, sealed up, the maggots had to be coming out of the bees. JOHN HAFERNIK : That's right, no place else for them to come from. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so you discovered that there was a tiny fly that was the parasite? JOHN HAFERNIK : Right, so it took a little detective work, another two weeks or so before the flies hatched out of their pupae and I could tell what they were. And I recognized them as being phorid flies, it's a group of flies that some are parasites, some are kind of scavengers, and I knew the phorid expert was Brian Brown at the Natural History Museum of L.A. County. JOHN HAFERNIK : So I called him up and then sent him examples, and he recognized them immediately as a native fly that normally feeds on bumblebees and paper wasps, but had never been found in honeybees before. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And how does it attack the honeybee? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, the way it attacks the honeybees, is that the female lands or chases a honeybee down and lands, gets on its back, her back, and then finds a weak spot. And honeybees have plates on their abdomen that are hard, but in between those segmental plates are membranes that allow them to be flexible. JOHN HAFERNIK : And the female finds those flexible membranous areas and has an ovipositor, it's kind of a hypodermic needle-like structure that she inserts in and starts injecting eggs into the abdomen of the bee. IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so then that reacts with the bee and sort makes the bees act like zombies? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well eventually. What happens is that those eggs hatch, and they hatch into little maggots, your fly larvae, and begin feeding on the internal contents of the bee, and at some point as this goes along, it starts modifying the behavior of the bee such that the bee does things that bees don't normally do like flying out of a hive at night. \n\n ###",

IRA FLATOW, HOST : And so they - you find them on the floor underneath, on the ground underneath... JOHN HAFERNIK : Yeah, and so I - it took me a while to figure out why they were in front of the biology building. I often walk with my head looking down, looking for interesting things in front of me instead of looking up. If I were an ornithologist, maybe I'd be looking up more. JOHN HAFERNIK : So later I went out and looked up, and it was right under the lights at the biology building. They were coming up, and we have a bee hive right next to the north part of the biology building. So they were literally flying a beeline from that bee hive to the light. IRA FLATOW, HOST : But in your paper, you're sort of sounding an alarm. You're not just pointing out some interesting phenomenon under the street light in front of your lab, but that - you think there's a real danger this could be spreading or taking over the bee population? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, we think we need to be careful about this because this is a native fly that's now expanded its host range into a non-native species, the honeybee. So this is something the honeybee hasn't experienced before, and potentially it could be a bigger problem for that species, since it hasn't co-evolved with its parasite. JOHN HAFERNIK : We don't know exactly what the extent of the problem is at this point, and some of the accounts I've seen in the media have been - have overstated what we're trying to say. We're not saying we found the solution to colony collapse disorder or that this is going to kill all the honeybees across the United States, but it is something we need to take seriously and to monitor closely to find out indeed how important this is going to be for survival of honeybees. IRA FLATOW, HOST : If you're a beekeeper with your own hives, can you look for symptoms of this, or is it obvious to you? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, it's probably initially not very obvious because the bees, as best we can tell, leave the hives at night, and so that's not a time when people mostly notice things. And also bees are always leaving hives, even during the daytime. So the unusual thing, of course, is they don't come back. JOHN HAFERNIK : But one of the ways beekeepers can monitor this is to set up a light next to their beehives and turning it on at night and see if they are attracting bees coming from their hives at night, if they are then to capture those bees and isolate them, either in a small vial or even an envelope or something like that, and leave them for a week or 10 days and then look and see if there's - if there are fly maggots or fly pupae surrounding those bees. IRA FLATOW, HOST : I'll bet you it took you a while to go out and collect a lot of bees, usually. JOHN HAFERNIK : Yeah, we've collected literally 10,000-plus bees as part of this study so far. IRA FLATOW, HOST : You must have had a lot of grad students out collecting. JOHN HAFERNIK : No, this was very much a group project, and it's not just my work, it's the work of a number of students at San Francisco State University. Andrew Core is the lead author on this paper. He did a lot of the work. Jonathan Ivers has done a lot of work with beekeepers in the Bay Area and so on. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Now the paper's been out a while, a few days actually. What kind of reaction have you been getting? People are saying, you know, I've seen that, I just didn't know what it was. Or gee, I've never seen anything like this. JOHN HAFERNIK : I've had emails from all over the world, from people describing behaviors that they've seen in bees, some that sound similar, some that probably are not closely related. And if someone out there has sent me an email, and I haven't answered it, I'm sorry, I haven't had time to answer all of those yet. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Do you want to hear from other people? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, we're interested in hearing about similar kinds of situations, especially if someone is willing to take enough time to isolate some of these bees and see if indeed they are getting larvae out of them because if they're getting the fly larvae out, then that's a pretty sure sign that they have parasitized bees. IRA FLATOW, HOST : Do we know that the bees may be passing them bee-to-bee within hive or between hives? JOHN HAFERNIK : Well, at this point it looks like it's probably mostly happening outside of the hive with foraging worker bees, but we have observed pupae of the flies and pupal shells, which means that the pupa has actually hatched, in one of observation hives that we've been looking at. And I've even seen a worker bee carrying around one of these pupae, maybe trying to get rid of it from the hive. \n\n ###",

And this week, Ross Douthat, of The New York Times, on politicians and privacy. Case in point, the criticism some commentators leveled at Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, he's spoken openly throughout a number of years about the grief he and his wife, Karen, shared with their family when they took home their infant son two hours after his death. On The Times' op-ed page over the weekend, Douthat argued that when politicians incorporate their families and personal choices into their campaigns, that becomes fair game. Really? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Can the personal ever not be political? Where do we draw the line? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Ross Douthat is a columnist for The New York Times, and he joins us here in Studio 3A. Nice to have you with us today. ROSS DOUTHAT : Thanks so much for having me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And that case - some of those criticisms leveled at Rick Santorum seem, well, to put it mildly, over the top. ROSS DOUTHAT : Over the top, I would go further. I think that they were stupid. But I think the point I was trying to make in the column was that there's a distinction between stupid and off limits. And by that, I mean, that, you know, Santorum and his wife suffered a terrible tragedy, the premature birth of their child, Gabriel, and they wrote a book about it and have discussed it openly and so on. And the reason that it is fraught and controversial is, obviously, because Santorum himself and his wife as well are famously pro-life. ROSS DOUTHAT : Santorum was a leading sponsor of the partial birth abortion ban, a sort of leading tribune of the pro-life cause. And what you see in the controversy over - the specific controversies over the fact that Santorum and his wife brought the body of their stillborn, you know, it was - at five and a half months of pregnancy child home with them overnight before burying it the next day. And you had a couple of commentators, Eugene Robinson of The Post and Alan Colmes on Fox, saying that that was creepy and bizarre, with the implication being it was creepy and bizarre because it showed how fanatically committed to the pro-life cause Santorum is. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, to some degree, also hypocritical that the drugs that... ROSS DOUTHAT : Well, this was the - right, this was the further point that was made by some leftwing bloggers was that in some of the accounts of how the premature birth happened, it seemed that maybe Santorum's wife had taken antibiotics knowing that they would hasten delivery of a child that couldn't survive. This doesn't seem to have been the case, but the argument was made that this was, in some sense, tantamount to a late-term abortion. And again, I think that argument is stupid. ROSS DOUTHAT : But I think that it's stupid in a way that we have to sort of expect to have, like, I don't think it's fair for the Santorums to say, well, it's OK for us to talk about our miscarried child and to talk about it in the context of, essentially, a pro-life argument about fetal life, but then to say, well, but we have a zone of privacy, and nobody can cross this zone of privacy and criticize us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So we can tell our story, but nobody else can tell it. ROSS DOUTHAT : Right. Because other people, you know, I think that the fact that the way that their story was contested was stupid and arguably offensive doesn't mean that it crossed a line of privacy, if that distinction makes sense. And I know it's sort of a fine distinction to make. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Another point - case in point, that of Sarah Palin, who, as a vice presidential candidate and as governor of Alaska, campaigned essentially with the Down syndrome baby. ROSS DOUTHAT : Right. And this is something you see again with the Santorums as well, where they have a daughter, Bella, who I believe is about 3 years old, who has trisomy 18. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Another genetic disorder. ROSS DOUTHAT : Another genetic condition that has similar but even, I think, worse effects than Down syndrome. And again, in that case, I think in a society where a huge proportion of both Down syndrome and trisomy 18 fetuses are aborted. The decision - one, the mere decision to carry the child to term, you know, can be seen to be the sort of ideological choice, in a sense. And two, then the decision to sort of publicize the decision and to - I mean, Palin incorporated special needs children into her speeches. Santorum cut a video - I think for Iowa - sort of focusing on Bella - a tremendously moving video, but a video that was clearly designed to make a kind of appeal to pro-life voters. ROSS DOUTHAT : And again, once the politician decides that they're sort of - that they're going to blur the personal and political in this way, you have to expect that people \u2013 again, often stupidly and offensively, but are, you know, are going to push back. And in Palin's case, it was, you know, these conspiracy theories about how Trig Palin wasn't really her child. And again, I thought - I think that they were ridiculous, but it wouldn't be fair for Palin to just say, well, you know, I have a right to privacy, because she's already sort of recognized that that line blurs. ROSS DOUTHAT : And the analogy that I drew maybe persuasive, maybe not, is that, if you're a politician in the Jim Crow South, right, where sex and reproduction are less contested, but race is clearly contested. For a politician to - a white politician to marry a black woman, right, in, say, Alabama 1932, that's inevitably a political as well personal statement, in a sense. And you have to - if you're a white politician who married a black woman, you would have to be ready for the blowback. So Santorum and Palin need to be ready for the blowback as well. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Then does that extend to, well, politicians' families? There is no politician - and you think of President Obama, his daughters, Malia and Sasha - appear from time to time. But it can't be said that they are used as poster children. They're on stage from time to time, but they're not part of his campaign... ROSS DOUTHAT : Right. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...not part of his narrative in the same way. Are they fair game? \n\n ###",

And how his position is vindicated by the experiences of his daughters. Then it would be perfectly reasonably... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Who do not attend public school. ROSS DOUTHAT : Who do not attend - right. So that would be a pretty - right - a pretty ineffective way of making the point. But just, you know, in the same way, you know, for a commentator, for instance, the way people did with Chelsea Clinton, right, to make fun of a public figure's child's appearance, I think clearly - I mean, you know, it's going to happen. But I think it clearly crosses a line, and it would be best if that didn't happen. But when the politician employs his children's lives, their stories as part of his, sort of, political or ideological narrative, then the, you know, the sort of claim that, oh, but they have to have their privacy as well, gets harder to make. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, let's get some callers in on the conversation. Where do we draw the line here? Our guest is Ross Douthat of The New York Times. 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Katie(ph), and Katie on the line with us from Orlando. KATIE : Hi. I think that politicians' lives, their personal lives, should be, you know, talk about. They want to make laws that affect our personal lives, like, for example, gay marriage. You know, I know we're talking about abortion, but, for example, gay marriage, he compares it to bestiality. And he... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Rick Santorum, right. ROSS DOUTHAT : Rick Santorum, yes. KATIE : Yeah, exactly, Santorum. And they're going to make statements like that, and they're going to impact the choices that we make in our bedrooms, for example, then, yes. I mean, everything they say and the choices that they've made in their lives should be discussed, openly, because they're usually hypocritical. And he wants to limit women's choice to - when to get an abortion if they can get an abortion. And I read that his wife would have had an abortion if they had any \u2013 if things hadn't worked out the way they had. I don't know the exact details, but she would have gotten an abortion. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well... KATIE : But now he's saying we can't. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Woulda, shoulda - we don't know that, Katie, for... ROSS DOUTHAT : Well, what was said, was, I believe, that Santorum was quoted as saying that not that they would have had an abortion in the sense of directly killing the fetus that was their child, Gabriel, but that they - had there been a situation where the only way to save her life was to actually induce labor, knowing that... NEAL CONAN, HOST : As consequence, the baby wouldn't... ROSS DOUTHAT : ...the baby wouldn't be able to survive, that they would have done that. And I think what - the difficulty with saying that that's the same as having an abortion, is that most, sort of, pro-life groups... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Including... ROSS DOUTHAT : ...including the Santorum's - my own, I should say, the Roman Catholic Church - would say that there's a distinction between the act of direct abortion and an intervention that is necessary to save the mother's life that - with the child. And, you know, in the case of Gabriel, he lived for two hours after delivery. It's not quite the same, clearly I think, as a partial birth abortion. ROSS DOUTHAT : But I do want to - I want to agree with Katie in the sense that - and I talked about this a bit in the column. In the debate over marriage, for instance, I think it is perfectly reasonable for, you know, in the debate about gay marriage, for instance, for supporters of gay marriage to say, well, you know, someone like Newt Gingrich, who says, you know, gay shouldn't be able to get married, it's - we should look at his personal life and see how seriously he has treated the institution of marriage. ROSS DOUTHAT : And I think it's a similar thing, where it's easier to say a politician's marital life is none of your business in an era when the definition of marriage isn't contested. And if the definition is contested, then the fact that Newt Gingrich has had two divorces and three wives \u2013 it's reasonable to say, well, that shows that, you know, how can we take him seriously in his argument for traditional marriage if he doesn't seem to take traditional marriage seriously himself? So in that sense, I think Katie makes a good point. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Katie, thanks very much. KATIE : Thank you. Bye. \n\n ###",

It was interesting, yes, the Santorums talk very openly about their story, included in their narrative. There was a not dissimilar circumstance in the Kennedy administration, where Patrick Kennedy was stillborn at Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod and very little made of that. That was kept private. ROSS DOUTHAT : It was kept private, and it wasn't - I mean, I should say that, you know, it wasn't a case - I believe the pregnancy was much further along and they're - I don't think, necessarily, there were, you know, the sort of - the medical details were different. But it was hard to imagine in 1963, that becoming a cultural war flashpoint because at that point, you know, there was a debate about abortion in the United States in early 1960s. But there was a, you know, abortion was generally illegal, and there was at least some kind of consensus around that issue in a way that there simply isn't today. ROSS DOUTHAT : And I think that's what you see as, sort of - as personal issues become politicized or become less politicized, the space that a politician has for privacy either expands or shrinks. So a politician has more privacy now, in the sense that, you know, he's not going to get attack by segregationists if he has an interracial marriage. But he has less privacy in the sense that issues like divorce, abortion, gay marriage and so on, are more likely to become political issues. NEAL CONAN, HOST : The opinion page, you can get a link to Ross Douthat's piece that ran in The New York Times over the weekend, by going to our website, npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joe is on the line, calling from Lansing. JOE : Yeah. Hey, Neal. Well, I didn't deter. There's just as many different lines as there are different politicians. You know, most of the journalists out there actually do a great job, and Ross is one of them. Most of them, they actually do a great job observing the lines. The lines are basically created by the politicians themselves. I mean, you just literally spoke of Kennedy on one side, Palin and Santorum on another. These individuals themselves are the ones creating their own lines as to what's private and what's not. So I don't really think that they do have a whole lot of wiggle room to say, woe is me, woe is me, that's off-limits. I, you know, the majority of, I think, journalists do actually do a good job. And as I said, Ross is one of them. ROSS DOUTHAT : That's very - I really appreciate that caller. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You didn't know you had... ROSS DOUTHAT : I think he's a wonderful human being. NEAL CONAN, HOST : You didn't know you had cousins in Lansing. But it does, though, raise the question of, all right, what if it's not part of the narrative? What if it is something that is kept private? Where do you draw the line there? Is it - it could be just as hypocritical, but nevertheless, not something that the politician was trumpeting in any way. ROSS DOUTHAT : Right. And I agree that it becomes more of a gray area, clearly when, you know, if, for instance, you know, Rick and Karen Santorum's personal tragedy had not been something that they had discusses publicly - Mrs. Santorum wrote a book about it and so on - then, yeah, then it gets murkier. And there - as the caller said, you know, there are sort of just judgment calls that the press, as a beast or as an institution, or as an individual, has to make. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joe, thanks for the call, and we'll expect you at the Douthat's Thanksgiving next year. Here's an email from Valerie in Roanoke. I think personal stories, anecdotes, et cetera, are used for political purposes - whether that's to humanize the candidate, illustrate their commitment to an ideal, show the importance of family life, et cetera - then those aspects of the candidate's life are fair game. However, if something is outside of the political campaign and the rhetoric, then it should be viewed as off-limits. The commenter should also stay away from personal attacks and stay in the realm of political relevance. Well, boy, there's another blurry line. ROSS DOUTHAT : It - well - but, you know, right, and that's the goal. But it's a good, you know, it's - you saw this - I think it was three or four Republican debates ago, right, where there was the... NEAL CONAN, HOST : I'd lost track. ROSS DOUTHAT : ...the question. Well, it was when Gingrich was surging in the polls, and there was - the question was post to the assembled candidates. You know, do you feel that a candidate's personal life is fair game and so on? And it was this tremendously awkward scene where they sort of all took turns, basically saying, don't vote for Newt because he is - he was an adulterer. But obviously, didn't say it in the... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Those terms, those terms. ROSS DOUTHAT : The said, well, of course, it's, you know, it shows whether you keep your word and so on and all the rest of it. And it is - and then Gingrich had, I think, actually a pretty effective and humble response in that case. But it is - I think that what - my answer to the blurriness is that, when you can draw a line between policy and personal life, and when, sort of, that line - when there's that, sort of, particular level of hypocrisy that's achieved - for instance, a pro-life candidate, you know, whose wife had an abortion - I don't think it's fair for the pro-life candidate to say, well, that's a private matter, right? Because that goes to the heart of the policy question under dispute. But it's trickier with things like, you know, is a politician's adultery an issue if you can't necessarily draw a line between that and policy? NEAL CONAN, HOST : So as we go ahead, it is going to be instructive... To some degree, it's been patty-cake up until now. The gloves started to come off a little bit in Iowa, a little bit more on Sunday in New Hampshire. South Carolina, it looks like it could be very tough. ROSS DOUTHAT : Right, although they're coming off - I mean, what's interesting about the Republican campaign now, is that, at least as far as we know, the front-runner, Mitt Romney, has led a - well, with the exception perhaps of the, you know, the story about putting a dog on the roof of his station wagon while driving... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Right. \n\n ###",

In 2007, she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for her clear-headed and courageous commentary. She made headlines in 2009 when The Atlanta Journal-Constitution transferred her to Washington and removed her from its editorial board. Critics said this changed the paper's longstanding editorial outlook. It's one of many changes and challenges she's faced in opinion journalism. Cynthia Tucker joins us in a moment. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Why do you read op-eds? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Our email address is talk@npr.org, or join the conversation at our website. Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION. Cynthia Tucker joins us now from a studio in Atlanta. Welcome back to the program, and congrats on your position at the University of Georgia. CYNTHIA TUCKER : Thank you so much. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : You were a columnist for more than two decades. What about the job changed over that time? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Well, Jennifer, as you know, newspapers have changed over that time. When I entered the business way back in - I won't say when... CYNTHIA TUCKER : ...newspapers were still delivered to the doorsteps of most Americans. While many Americans certainly got their news from television and radio, newspapers were still the dominant source of news for the vast majority of voters. And that has changed significantly over my career. But there were also a couple of changes that I think of as more positive in newspapers during my career. When I entered the business, there were very few women in high-ranking positions. CYNTHIA TUCKER : In the newspaper industry, it had been a profession that had always been dominated by men, and was still so when I joined my first newsroom. And there were very few black professionals in newsrooms, particularly Southern newsrooms, when I started at The Atlanta Journal. And over the course of my career, that also changed. Now, most journalism professors will tell you that most of their classes are made up of women. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Mm-hmm. Well, as are many - most college grads these days are women, I guess. CYNTHIA TUCKER : Absolutely. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So particularly in the field of journalism, they see this? CYNTHIA TUCKER : They see this in journalism, and women have moved up into pivotal roles in newsrooms, broadcast and print. There are managing editors, editors and publishers of newspapers throughout the country. Black professionals have also moved up into pivotal roles. The New York Times named its very first woman editor, Jill Abramson, just a few months ago. So while newspapers have lost their dominant position as the way most voters get their news, the flipside has been that there has been some real progress in terms of diversity in newspaper newsrooms over those years. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : And do you think that, then, this is changing maybe the breadth or tone of things we read on the op-ed page? Can someone open an op-ed page today and see a topic they just may not have seen 20 years ago? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Oh, yes. One of the things that absolutely delighted me over the course of my career was seeing that, again, the addition of women to newsrooms and the addition of black professionals meant that things that had not been considered news, say, in 1950 or 1960, were considered not only important enough to put it in the news pages, but important enough and interesting enough to talk about on the op-ed pages. One of the... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Does an example come to mind? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Yes, indeed. Education issues, child-rearing and parenting issues, columns about how to balance workplace and family have all been talked about on op-ed pages over the last 15 years. CYNTHIA TUCKER : In fact, I would argue that now most readers don't think that it's odd to see a piece on the op-ed page about a confrontation that a parent might have had with her child's teacher, or how I have - how best to deal with bullying in schools. 30 years ago, you never saw pieces about bullying in schools. And bullying, believe me, is not knew... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Hmm. That is true. CYNTHIA TUCKER : ...but now you do. And now, readers don't even find it odd to encounter those topics on op-ed pages. And I think that's a wonderful change. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Really interesting. OK. Let's get a call on the line here. Denise(ph) is in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Hi, Denise. DENISE : Hi. Good afternoon. I read the op-ed pages pretty religiously. I think they help me articulate how I feel. I'm not a professional writer, and I really feel that I get more depth and understanding by reading things in a little longer format. I know that some people think that newspapers, particularly, are not -  are kind of going the way of the dinosaur, but I don't think that's ever going to be true completely because we get so much more depth from a longer piece. And it helps me articulate my opinions better when I'm better informed. \n\n ###",

CYNTHIA TUCKER : I'm delighted to hear that. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : So, Cynthia, is that what's part of your job, is to tap into something that people may already feel, just haven't articulated? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Well, the good, persuasive writer is certainly tapping into a subject that interests people, and it may be a subject that many readers haven't thought about. But you want to write about it in a way that grabs their attention, interests them. And if you're, again, a good, persuasive writer, you want to encourage them to at least think about the subject from your point of view. CYNTHIA TUCKER : Now, over the decades, I was lucky enough to have a lot of loyal readers who would come up to me in the grocery store or at church or send me letters or email that said, that's exactly what I think. I'm so glad you said that. And that's really wonderful. I don't think you'll ever meet a columnist who will tell you that he or she doesn't enjoy getting that kind of email. But I also enjoy getting email or letters or phone calls from readers who said, you know, I enjoy writing your - reading your columns even though I rarely agree with you. You force me to think about an issue a little bit differently. You argue your point of view well. And I enjoyed hearing those comments too. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : I think this caller might have something to add there. Richard is in Wichita, Kansas. RICHARD : Yes. Ms. Tucker, I've been fan for many years. CYNTHIA TUCKER : Well, thank you. RICHARD : Back when you first started appearing on TV, I was always very impressed with your what were at that time seemed like center-left and very astute analyses of the complex factors feeding into social and political issues. And I noticed over time that it seemed like you, and for that matter the rest of the writers in op-ed, seem to drift off into hardened position, one side of the other, of the political spectrum. I mean, you seemed to have gone kind of into the far left, and you seemed to drift from analysis into moralizing. And I've seen that throughout the editorial pages. I wonder if you could explain what happened to the old careful, analytical stuff that I really used to get into that would analyze stuff, and whether or not you see this as a reflection of an electorate that is less and less educated because of the players, the educational system in the '60s and '70s and '80s. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Wow. A lot of issues there. Richard, thank you. CYNTHIA TUCKER : I'm telling you, that's a tightly packed question. I can only respond about my own points of view, which I don't think my politics or ideology have changed over the last 25 years or so. That is not to say that my points of view on particular issues haven't changed. I have certainly changed my mind about some things, but I was center-left in 1985. I was center-left in 2005. And I'm center-left today. CYNTHIA TUCKER : I think that if it - part of what - is it Richard - part of what Richard may have been responding to is seeing and hearing me in different forums. I try to be very thoughtful and analytical when I'm writing in newspaper column. When I'm on TALK OF THE NATION, I try to be very thoughtful or analytical. But I will admit that when I have appeared on television shows, where you don't have a lot of time to articulate a point of view, those cable shows that can be a little more like food fights, I often... CYNTHIA TUCKER : ...perhaps I seemed a little more strident because you only have time to get one or two sentences in, and those are not the formats that necessarily lend themselves to reasoned opinion. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. There's an honest answer. Richard, thanks for the call. RICHARD : Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Let's get another one in here. Ruth is in Marietta, Ohio. Hi there. RUTH : Hi. My acquaintance with Cynthia Tucker is only over public television when she appeared as a guest editor, and I loved her. I never had the privilege of reading anything she wrote. But the reason I called is to thank her for being herself. My husband was very old school. The smart people were the men. The smart people were the white people. And Cynthia Tucker was neither, and he thought she was brilliant. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Oh, that's a nice comment. CYNTHIA TUCKER : Oh, that's wonderful compliment. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Ruth, thank you for sharing that. \n\n ###",

JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : You're listening TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Another question. Now we have Jeff(ph) in Sioux City, Iowa. Hi there. JEFF : Hi. I - my question is, I don't understand why any newspaper would pay an editorial writer for their opinions when they can get all the opinions they want from their subscribers for free. JEFF : My local newspaper paid editorials are so bias that I actually ended my subscription. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Cynthia? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Oh, my goodness gracious. I would like to think as a journalist of some 30 years standing that I bring some knowledge to the craft that the average reader doesn't bring. I am better informed about many issues, not because I'm smarter than the average reader, but because I have had the luxury of being paid to be better informed about many issues. CYNTHIA TUCKER : The good opinion writer is a reporter first. I spent my earliest years in this business as a reporter. When I was transferred to Washington a couple of years ago, I had time to cover Congress, cover the agencies up close. And much of my time was spent in reporting, and so I ought to know something about the subject about which I'm writing that the average reader doesn't because he or she doesn't have time to do the reporting that I've done. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Jeff, are you convinced? JEFF : No. I understand her point of view. However, for every point of view, there's always an opposite point of view, and it is... JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : But what about the value of informed point of view, someone who's, you know, made the rounds and followed people? JEFF : I understand. I'm not really - I'm not in - I'm not disagreeing with the professional editorial writer. I'm disagreeing with the local newspaper, which does not also publish the other side of the view. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Well, thanks so much for sharing, Jeff. JEFF : OK. Thank you. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : All right. Let's get one more call in here, Gary(ph) in Marble, Minnesota. Hi there. GARY : Afternoon. I grew up in northern Minnesota, fairly isolated. I never saw a black person until I was 16 years of age, and then I was in the hospital, you know, having a surgery done. And I consider Ellen Goodman and Sydney Harris to be a couple of my mentors because - as well as other op-ed people. But they brought in information to me which I would never have gotten from my local paper. And I'm just curious as to what or who your guest considers her mentors. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : Nice question. Gary, thanks for calling. Cynthia Tucker, who are your mentors? CYNTHIA TUCKER : Well, I am a huge fan of Ellen Goodman, and I considered her a mentor from afar. Ellen was one of the women - one of the earliest women to have success as a syndicated newspaper columnist, and she was one of those who helped bring to the op-ed pages topics that had been off limits before. She talked about women's issues a lot. She talked about employment discrimination, sexism. And it was very encouraging to see a woman out there writing about those issues, writing about them forcefully and well. I met Ellen and she was always personally encouraging of me in my career. CYNTHIA TUCKER : If I go back further, though, to think about - I've had the privileged of knowing a lot of good reporters and good opinion writers who were very encouraging of me in my career, including Bill Raspberry who work for the Washington Post and was syndicated a long time and is now retired. So I've been lucky to have met some of the best and have them give me a pat on the back from time to time. JENNIFER LUDDEN, HOST : We have just a moment left. Do you have any advise for aspiring, or now that we are in the era of the blogosphere, amateur op-ed writers? \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. In New Hampshire tomorrow, anyone registered as an independent can vote in either the Republican or the Democratic presidential primary. President Obama does not have a lot of organized opposition, so all the attention and most of the independents will focus on the more competitive Republican race. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And political professionals will pore over the results for omens and portents. In a recent column, Clarence Page wondered why. Yes, the number of registered independents grows as the rolls of Republicans and Democrats dwindle, but research suggests that very few so-called independents switch back and forth and that they do not decide close elections. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you're a registered independent, call and tell us why, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Later in the program, the FAA plays Grinch and grounds a flock of whooping cranes being guided by an ultralight aircraft. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But first, the role of independents. Clarence Page joins us here in Studio 3A. His column is syndicated by the Chicago Tribune. Always nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION, Clarence. CLARENCE PAGE : Always great to be here, Neal, thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And independents would seem by definition to be the persuadable middle that every politician wants to win over. CLARENCE PAGE : Well, they are persuadable, but they tend to not be persuaded very far, it turns out. This has intrigued me for years, that there have been studies - well, as far back as 1992 there was a book out called \"The Myth of the Independent Voter.\" A team of about half-a-dozen professors pulled their research together and found that among people who declare themselves to be independent or - well, not undecided but who registered independent or who call themselves independent, that somewhere around 80, 85 percent of the time, they vote for one of the two parties. CLARENCE PAGE : In other words, they don't want to be identified with a particular party, but they tend to vote with that party. I call it the Groucho effect. Remember Groucho Marx wouldn't belong to a club that would accept him as a member? This is a bit of a reversal. We've got voters who will vote for the candidates of a certain party but won't declare themselves to be a part of it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yet how does that explain the rise of independents, as yes, Democrats still I think far outnumber registered Republicans, but both of their roles are diminishing as the number of independents increases. CLARENCE PAGE : It's true, and I think there's a lot of different reasons people will give you. Certainly initially I'd say the suburbanization of America, we've been seeing this kind of a trend happen since after World War II. You know, the old urban, heavily immigrant populations, you know, you'd have the precinct captain and the ward boss, and there were services that you turned to the organization to provide. CLARENCE PAGE : Even Chicago, the queen of machine cities, your average precinct captain, if there are any around now, is a 55-year-old woman who shows up on election day to work the poll. But you don't have, in most wards, that kind of old organization that you really relied on. CLARENCE PAGE : So it's not that important to declare yourself with just one party, and especially if you're a suburbanite; they're much more likely to be swing voters and certainly more likely to want to be - declare themselves to be independent of any particular party. NEAL CONAN, HOST : For those who don't remember, yes, for jobs, for a  turkey at Christmas, for a bucket of coal in the wintertime, real services, real things that meant things to real people. CLARENCE PAGE : Everything from birth to where your grandmother would be put into a nursing home, all these things you would turn to the organization, quote-unquote, to help you with. NEAL CONAN, HOST : No longer a factor, so as the number of independents increases, it seems that then - I was fascinated by the research that suggested that, in fact, independents do not decide - you'd think they would still be the swing voters, but they don't decide close elections. CLARENCE PAGE : Yeah, this really surprised me. You know, there is a professor Alan Aramowitz of Emory University, who has been studying this using voting statistics, and he found that the - well, as he put it, in all three of the presidential elections since 1972 that were decided by a margin of less than five points, that the candidate backed by the independents lost. CLARENCE PAGE : This was - this surprised me. You know, he's citing here Jimmy Carter in '76, Gerald Ford - sorry, Gerald Ford beat - excuse me, Gerald Ford won the independent vote but lost the election. Put it that way, OK. CLARENCE PAGE : Most independents voted for George W. Bush in 2000, but Al Gore got the overall popular vote. As you recall, he got the popular vote but not the state vote. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Yeah, but that's fudging your statistics a little bit. The guy who got the independent vote got the big prize. CLARENCE PAGE : Yeah, but still, though, most of the - the one backed by the independent voters, though, did not get the majority of the popular vote. And in 2004, John Kerry, most independents voted for John Kerry, but he lost the overall election. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### CLARENCE PAGE : What does that mean? What it means is that Karl Rove and others, who have often advocated firing up the base rather than reaching out for independents, they've got a point. In some elections, that works. If you fire up your base, get your vote out, it can be big enough that it will overwhelm the opposition and the independents, because independents also tend to have the least turnout, and they also tend to be the least committed, not just to a party but also to - well, less engaged with the whole campaign. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Interesting, on a day that the chief of staff leaves at the White House, a man seen as a conciliatory figure, wanted to reach out and appeal to that middle, as we were just talking a moment before the show, not a wartime consigliore. CLARENCE PAGE : This is a time, yeah, where people are really looking closely at how important is it to reach out for independents or how important to fire up your base. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's get another voice into the conversation. Academics, as we just heard, suggest the swing voter hardly exists. We would like to hear from a real political professional. Daron Shaw was a campaign strategist for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, also spent some time observing the Perry campaign last fall. Daron Shaw, nice to have you with us today. DARON SHAW : Very nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Daron Shaw is at the studios of member station KUT in Austin. So does that - is that swing voter mythological? Is it something that is worth appealing for, or, as Clarence just suggested, is a more productive tactic to fire up your base and get those who are going to vote for you to turn out? DARON SHAW : Well, I think the thing that Clarence pointed out that's worth reiterating is that the distinguishing characteristic of independent voters is they're not that interested, they're not that involved, they're not that engaged with politics. So if you're a political professional and you're dealing with finite resources, and you have to make decisions about where you're going to invest dollars, and where you're going to invest manpower, you know, the idea of reaching out to independents, who may or may not show up, and if they do show up may or may not vote for you, can give you pause. DARON SHAW : So you know, it's interesting that there's been this movement in the last two or three election cycles, and as Clarence correctly pointed out, I think Karl Rove is kind of given credit for this, although I don't know if he's, you know, the architect or godfather of it; a lot of people who have moved in this direction. DARON SHAW : But the idea of sinking your resources into mobilization, which primarily targets, you know, sort of identifiable partisans and appeals to them, that that's become kind of a staple and maybe even the dominant perspective. And I find it kind of interesting that word out of the White House - and you have to read all these things with a dose of caution - but suggests that they're kind of moving in that direction. That's sort of what their thinking is. And I just find that fascinating. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We've seen that in the speech at Osawatomie and various other aspects. So it does look like that's the case and has interesting implications if that is true for the candidate in the Republican primary scene as the most likely to appeal to moderates. DARON SHAW : Well, yeah, and I - you know, this is not something that I was overjoyed to find out, Neal, because, you know, I like the idea of crossing over, the idea of appealing to moderate of both parties, trying to reach some happy medium in between. I think polls certainly indicate that most American voters think that's a good idea, at least theoretically. DARON SHAW : But insofar as how they vote, there's a lot of evidence that would indicate that trying to fire up the base, whether you're on the right or the left, can work(ph) . A big question for the Republicans right now is whether, in this series of debates that the candidates have been having, have they moved so far to the right that they've just left that much more room for Barack Obama to operate in seeking his re-election? We'll see. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, let's get some listeners in on the conversation. If you're registered as an independent, call and tell us why, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org.  Jack's on the line calling from Chester in South Carolina. JACK : Good afternoon, thank you for taking my call. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Sure. JACK : I've registered - I've always been a registered independent. I don't think that independents hold much sway here in South Carolina, and I usually split my ticket in, you know, about every election that I cast a vote in. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And do they have open primaries in South Carolina? We'll know this as a fact in a couple of weeks, but do you know that? JACK : No, sir, you need to be affiliated with one party or the other to vote in the primary. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And when you say you split your ticket, you might vote Republican for Congress and Democratic for governor, something like that? JACK : Yes, sir, exactly. \n\n ###",

JACK : I think they probably target their base more than anything else. You know, the reason why I'm not affiliated is because I do - I vote for who I feel like is going to represent us best, and so that usually leads me to split my vote. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Jack, thanks very much for the call, and have a good time. You're going to be seeing some interesting advertising in the next couple of weeks. Daron Shaw, that closed primary system, obviously it's an open primary tomorrow in New Hampshire, independents can vote for Republicans or Democrats, closed primary, that changes things too. DARON SHAW : Yeah, the distinction that we raise in political science is between an open primary, in which case there usually is no party registration - that is to say you register as a voter but not as a Republican, a Democrat or an independent. DARON SHAW : Texas has a system like this, and that means that when election day rolls around, primary election day, you get to choose. You can either vote in the Democratic or the Republican primary. New Hampshire technically has what we call a semi-open or a semi-closed system. That is to say, out-partisans cannot participate. DARON SHAW : So if you're registered Democrat, you can't vote in the Republican, and vice versa, but registered Republicans and \u2013 now, we're calling them independents but technically they're actually DTS-ers, decline to state, people who simply don't identify with one of the political parties - they are allowed to choose whichever primary they want to vote in. DARON SHAW : And then a closed primary means that only registered partisans are allowed to participate. And you know, the research shows - I think this is kind of interesting - that there aren't the significant effects you might assume associated with open versus closed versus semi-open. DARON SHAW : That is to say, you might assume that a closed primary process would produce more extreme ideological candidates, and we don't have a lot of evidence that that's the case, which I think always kind of catches everybody else by surprise. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Do closed primaries lead to larger percentages of registered voters being registered in one party or the other? DARON SHAW : There's some evidence of that. But the difficulty is the states change the rules so frequently. In the South... NEAL CONAN, HOST : They do. DARON SHAW : Yeah, in the South we've traditionally had - Texas and other places - open primaries dating back to days of Jim Crowe. You know, if you didn't get a chance to vote in the Democratic primary, you had no say in the election process whatsoever. So it's sort of a vestige like - of those days. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We'll talk more about that. So there are local and regional differences as well. Stay with us. We're talking about the role of independent voters in primaries and general elections. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. The polls open early tomorrow morning in New Hampshire, where voters are expected to grant Mitt Romney another win. Part of the reason he's expected to do well is his strength among independent voters in the Granite State. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Undeclared voters make up 41 percent of the electorate. A recent University of New Hampshire poll found many of those independent voters favor the former Massachusetts governor. They might still deliver a surprise tomorrow. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So tell us, if you're a registered independent in New Hampshire or elsewhere, why? 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Nice to have you. TIM : Yeah, look, I discussed it with your screener, and I guess my position is just that both parties are bought and paid for and are fully owned. And the candidates, even if they come into office with good ideals, end up getting paid for and corrupted. So that's basically the reason why I'm an independent. \n\n ###",

TIM : No, you know, I'm still a very passionate citizen. I'm a very patriotic person, and I care about our country, and while I do think it's going in the wrong direction, I don't think it's beyond hope, and I do vote for the people that I think are the best candidates. And I try to consider everyone from both sides. TIM : But I think the corporate control of our political system is destroying our democracy, and I think that is - if there's any issue that matters, that single issue is the one issue that matters most to me. NEAL CONAN, HOST : OK, did you vote Democratic last time, Republican last time? Will you again? TIM : Yeah, I was telling your screener, I was a - I did vote for Obama, and I really believed in him, and I really thought it was a pivotal moment in our history, and it feels like all that energy has been squandered. TIM : Both houses of Congress were controlled by the Democrats and the presidency, and not a single conviction in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. It's wholeheartedly disappointing. I may vote for him again by default, but I was telling your screener if Huntsman got through, and I don't believe he could, I don't believe a moderate can win the Republican nomination, but if he got through, I would have to take a very hard look at him. I really like a lot of the things he says. TIM : And I believe he's a man of character. I just don't think he's going to get nominated by the Republicans. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think most Republicans think you're right. Tim, thanks very much for the call. TIM : Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And it's interesting, Daron Shaw, if you're looking at what that caller just said, one of the things you might look at is turnout. It was interesting, for example, going back to what happened in Iowa, the Republican turnout just a skosh higher than it was four years ago, when there was considerable more energy on the Democratic side, and most people said wait a minute, that extra energy in the Republican Party this year largely due to the effect of Ron Paul, who did very well, finishing in third place, and is expected to do again pretty well and finish second or third in New Hampshire tomorrow. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That - if you're talking about the importance of getting your base out, the turnout in these primaries, that might be the number you ought to look at. DARON SHAW : Yeah, I think there's some truth to that. I'm a little hesitant to make comparisons on the Republican side 2008 to 2012 just because, you know, it's interesting, the Republicans had so much energy, and there was so much dynamism on the right leading up to the 2010 elections, and I do think that's ebbed a little bit. DARON SHAW : But the polling numbers we're seeing show that Republican voters are more engaged, more interested, more involved now than the Democrats and actually by a fairly wide margin. The question in this election cycle - and you can glean some evidence from the primaries - but the question is whether the Democrats get engaged, get interested and sort of match the Republican enthusiasm, or maybe exceed it, as they certainly did in 2008, whether that occurs over the next few months, right. DARON SHAW : The Democrats don't have a contest going on right now. So some of this difference is sort of natural. But I wonder. I wonder where the enthusiasm is this time around. In 2008, it was with the Democrats. In 2010, it was with the Republicans, but as this caller just suggested, there are a lot of people out there who are like, well, we tried the Republicans, and we were disappointed, we tried the Democrats and were disappointed, and, you know, what's left? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Where do we go? This an email, Andrea(ph) in Berkeley: I still count myself a Democrat but registered as an independent after the Bush-Gore vote-counting debacle. I felt let down by the Democratic Party. For the sake of getting on with things, for the sake of the country, they failed to uphold the idea of democratic society. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I have been disillusioned by their ability to counteract the Republicans. I felt that Nancy Pelosi, upon the election of Barack Obama, made the comment he shouldn't expect an easy ride with complete support, or something to that effect, I cannot imagine any Republican in Congress making any comment to that effect if a Republican president was elected. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A lot of disillusioned Democrats out there, Clarence. CLARENCE PAGE : Yeah, and that's not news. And you could see it in news reports. You can see if you walk down your block, probably, you know, and talk to people who voted for Obama four years ago. You'll hear people who say they're disappointed, or they will criticize this or that. CLARENCE PAGE : At the same time, Barack Obama's approval numbers have been going back up in recent weeks as he has gone out on the stump and tried to fire up the base with more of a populist approach and more recently in the confirmation fights over Cordray, the bank, consumer protection advocate. CLARENCE PAGE : These kind of fights tend to work well for him now in his approvals, but I think you're not going to see a lot of action, firing up Democrats, for a few more months because at the present time, like President Obama said when Jay Leno asked him about the - whether he was following the Republican debates, he said I'm going to wait and see who gets voted off the island. \n\n ###",

So you're not hearing a lot coming from the Democratic side except with what they call, you know, truth squads, just talking about - giving their spin on the issues that arise. CLARENCE PAGE : But right now, the best news for Obama is the jobless figures improved a fraction here in this latest report. He's hoping (unintelligible) the economy will continue like that. And that'll make a difference as far as a lot of attitudes people have who are feeling disappointed. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Email from Kate(ph) in Portland: I changed from Democrat to non-affiliated voter because I did not want to give my head count to either party. I would like the two-party system to fail because I think it is a big part of our problem. And Clarence, every election cycle, we hear this over and over: Why is there not a centrist third party? Why is there the two-party system that freezes everybody out so often? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Daron Shaw can tell us in a moment why all the election laws are written to make it almost impossible to mount a third-party, credible third-party threat in many states, but... CLARENCE PAGE : You took my answer number one, but there's more. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Go ahead. CLARENCE PAGE : I was going to say number one is because the two existing parties have rigged the structure to make it hard for a third party to get rolling. But at the same time, though, you find that - well, look at Ross Perot. He did the best of anybody since Teddy Roosevelt, and he did it by having the right kind of message at the right kind of time. CLARENCE PAGE : I think, frankly, this coming year is the best we've seen in memory for launching a third party. I'm not saying it's necessarily going to have a shot at winning, but you hear a lot of people, like a couple of callers we've had here, saying they're fed up with both parties, they want to see somebody like Ron Paul. CLARENCE PAGE : I had one of my readers emailed me yesterday suggesting a Ron Paul-Dennis Kucinich ticket. CLARENCE PAGE : How about that, you know, a couple of feisty independents, one Republican, one Democrat. You hear a lot of people saying they want this. CLARENCE PAGE : But quite seriously, I think that for the same reason that you are hearing a lot about these independent voters who weren't really independent, these folks who are fed up with both parties tend for whatever reasons not to be as engaged, probably the most likely not to show up at the polls if they really feel fed up right to the end. CLARENCE PAGE : And so, you know, that's one big reason why third parties don't get started because it takes committed people to want to start one and keep it going. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, Daron Shaw, a committed person, Donald Trump says after his TV program ends in the spring, he might consider it. A lot of people don't take him seriously because you have to be the combination of a Talmudic scholar and particle physicist specialist to be able to figure out all of the machinations you need to get on the ballot in places like New York. DARON SHAW : Yeah, well, it obviously - the Virginia rules obviously eluded, you know, the majority of the Republican field. So this is clearly a pretty complex endeavor, and that's within the party. You know, I had a professor one time when I was doing grad work who referred to parties as they're very much like public utilities, which is they're sort of quasi-public operations. DARON SHAW : They're regulated very much by the states. You know, for instance, New Hampshire will count - the state of New Hampshire will count the votes in the Republican and Democratic primaries tomorrow, which is really kind of fascinating when you think about it, right? DARON SHAW : I mean, why should, you know, the state machinery, the state governmental machinery be responsible for counting what's essentially a party contest? But the parties have  bargained some of those freedoms that you get for kind of running their own elections and having rules as they see fit in exchange for the protection of the state, the state legislatures and the state statutory processes, to make it very difficult for competitors to enter the political market. And you see that in a state like Texas, where if you want to run as an independent candidate, you have to get, I believe, it's 50,000 signatures of registered voters who had not voted in the primaries, which I guess is a demonstration that this is now some sort of sore loser provision or something like that. But those sorts of laws existed across the board. DARON SHAW : Actually, one of the most interesting consequences of Perot's candidacy - and to a lesser extent John Anderson in 1980 - is that they did manage to chip away at some of those laws. But I would also raise kind of a, you know, geeky, academic distinction here. I think it's very possible to see an independent candidacy for the president this time. That's not a third party... NEAL CONAN, HOST : No. DARON SHAW : ...you know? And I think that's an important distinction. You know, a third party is a, you know, Ross Perot or Donald Trump spends their billions of dollars financing 100 House candidates in districts across the country. And that's just something... NEAL CONAN, HOST : It's got to be 435, if he hopes to get anything done. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : You can have a lot of influence, but you wouldn't have a majority. DARON SHAW : No, but you could make the majority, and I think that's what you see in European countries, right?

But that's the kind of thing that we, you know, we did use to see not that sort of strategic kind of maneuvering, but that's the way parties used to be. Third-party movements, historically, in the 19th century, were mostly localized and kind of focused on congressional races and kind of representation of movements. And with Teddy Roosevelt and sort of ever since then, they've largely been - you know, with a few exceptions - essentially kind of personal vanity vehicles, you know, the expressions of people who had a political following or a lot of money and want to make a political point. DARON SHAW : I think we're likely to see that again. Certainly, Trump is an example of that. But it would be interesting to see if you could get these diverse sets of interests that are just fed up with the political parties. If you could unite them, even if it was just on the basis of grievance, you know, opposition to the two existing parties, you might be able to do some damage. But I agree with all the points that have been made about how difficult it is to do that mechanically. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Daron Shaw, professor of government at the University of Texas in Austin, with us from KUT. Clarence Page is here with us in Studio 3A. He's a syndicated columnist for the Chicago Tribune. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you from NPR News. Let's go to Stephanie. Stephanie with us from Elko in Nevada. STEPHANIE : Hi. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi, Stephanie. STEPHANIE : I've been a registered independent for almost 30 years, my entire voting career. And my husband is now registered independent also. We're very interested in politics. I'm a poli sci major, and we follow elections and never miss one. And we actually go stand in line. We don't vote by mail. But we've never felt like we found a home with either party that, you know, they just - for the most part, didn't define us more than they did define us, so we keep all of our options open, and we get fewer phone calls that way also. NEAL CONAN, HOST : That is an advantage I haven't thought about. Do you mostly vote one party or another? STEPHANIE : It really depends. We were both from western South Dakota, and we've been 15 years in conservative northeastern Nevada, (unintelligible) local and regional elections. Usually, a Republican is about your only choice, so we tend to vote Republican in those elections, and we tend to vote our conscience in everything else. I'm a gateway issue voter. I'm rabidly pro-choice, so if you're not pro-choice, quit talking to me. My husband is a little more reasonable. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Stephanie, thanks very much. Interesting changes, as you watch the state of Nevada become more and more purple. Your previous iteration - parts of your life, it was reliably Republican, no longer the case. STEPHANIE : Well, out here, it's still solidly Republican. We are completely different than we know in Vegas. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, I get that, no. But statewide... STEPHANIE : Scarily so. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...is a little different. STEPHANIE : Yes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Thanks very much for the call. And that, Clarence, raises the issue of if you're a Democrat in Oklahoma, if you're a Republican in California, well, maybe some local places, yeah. But pretty much, if you wanted to have an influence on the election, you'd want to register as the party you don't believe in. CLARENCE PAGE : Well, that's certainly true for, I mean, Chicago has been doing that for years. If you don't register as a Democrat, then you don't have very many choices on primary election day, and you wouldn't... \n\n ###",

There weren't older birds that knew the way, so scientists taught birds to follow an ultralight aircraft. You might remember how that procedure worked with geese in the movie \"Fly Away Home.\" Now Operation Migration hopes to expand operations to re-open an Eastern flyway where whooping cranes disappeared in the 1800s. But this time, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded the plane and thus the birds along the way in Alabama. More on that in a moment. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you have questions about humans and the migration of whooping cranes, our phone number is 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation at our website. That's at npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joe Duff is co-founder and CEO of Operation Migration and lead pilot. He joins us from Fort Perry, Ontario, and nice to have you on the program today. JOE DUFF : Thank you very much. I appreciate being on it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So how come the flock is on the ground? JOE DUFF : Well, back in 2008, the FAA instituted a new set of regulations for a new category of aircraft. They used to be registered as ultralights, and now they are registered as sports light aircraft. And there are a bunch of rules with them, and one of the regulations is that you cannot fly a sports light aircraft for hire. And, of course, we have three pilots that do this. We have maintained that our pilots are paid for a long list of activities and volunteer their time for flying, but... NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is open to debate. JOE DUFF : It's open debate. All regulations are open to interpretation, and so that's where we are. FAA has not grounded us, though. We felt that we were in compliance with the regulations. And once they questioned us, then we voluntarily decided not to fly anymore so that we're not in violation of the rules. JOE DUFF : We don't want to fly in violation of the rules. We want to be good citizens if we can, but we're working now with the FAA to hopefully get a waiver for this regulation. Of course it wasn't written to curtail wildlife re-introduction. It was written for other purposes, but the rule stands, and, in fact, that's probably why the waiver option is available. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So we shouldn't cast the FAA as the Grinch here. JOE DUFF : No, I don't think so. I think, you know, we're getting good cooperation and a lot of support. They're trying to figure out a way around this for us, and - but we still have rules to abide by, so... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let us get back, though, to the larger issue of this migration route and the, well, just remarkable process that you folks use to imprint the birds with the idea that they should follow an ultralight aircraft. JOE DUFF : Yeah. It's a convoluted project. It started way back in 1988 when Bill Lishman was the first person to ever fly with birds, and then I joined him in 1993 when we came back with the first migration of Canada geese to see if it was possible, and it's evolved now to help re-introduce an endangered species. JOE DUFF : The problem, of course, is that, back in the 1940s, there were only 15 whooping cranes. That's all that existed in the world. They migrated from Northern Canada all the way down to Texas. And, of course, in Texas there's continued development pressure, and the spill that happened in the Gulf could threaten their habitat. JOE DUFF : So that's a very precarious situation even though the flock now has grown to - I think the last count was 278 birds. So we're trying to establish a separate flock that's not subject to the same threats, independent one migrating from Wisconsin to Florida. JOE DUFF : But the problem is whooping cranes learn a migration route by following their parents. It's passed from one generation to the next, and the last birds in the Eastern flyway were wiped out in the 1800s. So that migration route is also lost. It was lost until we discovered this method of actually using ultralight aircraft to teach them. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the method depends on the bird's instinct to imprint on the first creature it sees when it's born. JOE DUFF : Basically, yeah. Whooping cranes are hatched in the nest, in a marsh on the ground, basically, and they leave the nest almost immediately and follow their parents out to forage for food. And if they don't follow their parents, they're lost. So that natural instinct to imprint is there, and we just substitute parent for pilot and make sure they imprint on us. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the pilot, in this case, wears what I've heard described as a baggy bird suit. JOE DUFF : Yeah. Basically, we're trying to make sure these birds aren't familiar with humans. You know, a whooping crane is 5 feet tall and has a sharp beak and will defend itself if it feels threatened. So if you were to raise the birds just in normally dressed humans, talking in front of them, they would - when they're released into the wild, they would think humans is where the food comes from, so they would land next to them. So we isolate them. They don't - they - by the time our birds arrive in Florida, they will never - have never seen a normally dressed person. \n\n ###",

So once they're released, those things are unfamiliar with them and they are afraid of them, and they are actually wild birds. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So how do you - and you have been in that bird suit - how do you act around the birds? JOE DUFF : Well, basically, you - the bag - the big baggy costume covers us head to toe. We look to through a Mylar visor, so they can's see our face. We don't talk anywhere near the birds. We carry an MP3 player and a little speaker that produces a vocalization. It's basically a bird call, a whooping crane call. And we carry a puppet that looks like an adult bird. We can feed them with the puppet. We communicate just as if we were birds. So it's a fascinating thing to do. If you would just stop talking and listen for a while, you are allowed into their social structure, and we're just part of that structure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And I'm told that indeed that player, the MP3 player, yes, it's got whooping crane calls on it so they learn to hear those, but it's also mixed in there is the sound of the engine so they'd learn to like that too. JOE DUFF : Yeah, exactly. When the chick first starts to hatch, when they punch a whole in the egg, it's called pipping, and it can take a number of hours, thereafter, to finally hatch. And that's when the parents starts communicating with the chicks. So we play a recording of an adult bird call, and that's what called a brood call. And, basically, it means, you know, I'm OK. Everything is all right. We're here. And it's calming for the bird. And we also play a recording of the aircraft engine to get them used to it, so that they're familiar with that sound. It's not something that frightens them. JOE DUFF : When they're about, maybe, a week or so old, we actually introduce the real aircraft and they get familiar with the shape and the sight and the sound of that. And then a little later on, we use what's called a circle pen. We have a pen that's about 30 feet in diameter, 2 feet high. We put the chick on the inside, the aircraft on the outside. Then we taxi around the perimeter. And we use a puppet that looks like an adult, and we can pull a trigger in that puppet and it will dispense mealworms. JOE DUFF : So we tap on the ground, the chick comes over to find the food. We move the aircraft ahead and the chick follows the puppet again, and eventually the chick will be following us. So it's a long, slow process. It takes a huge number of hours, seven days a week. But once the birds are - all this takes place at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, where they have the largest captive flock of whooping cranes, and that's where the eggs are produced. When the birds are roughly 40 days of age or 50 days of age, we transport them in containers by private aircraft to Wisconsin. JOE DUFF : We spend the entire summer working with them. That's where they learn to fly and get conditioned to follow our aircraft. And then in October we start the migration. It usually takes us about three months to get all the way down to Florida. We monitor the birds over the winter. And then in the spring, they make the return migration on their own. And from then on, they're wild birds. Each year, we add a new generation, hoping to build the flock up to the point where it'll be self-sustaining. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And therefore, should something terrible happen to that flock in Texas, there will be a backup. JOE DUFF : Exactly. It won't be the end of whooping cranes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Joe Duff, co-founder and CEO of Operation Migration. If you got questions about the human assistance provided to whooping cranes, to learn their route on migration, give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Zack. And Zack is on the line from Iowa City. ZACK : Hello. I - this is super fascinating. I wanted to ask how you choose the route? And, you know, most migrating birds have to stop and rest, and I wonder how you manage that. Do you have to find an airstrip near a marsh or near someplace where they can rest? Or can you land on an airstrip and then somehow take the birds further away? I wanted to ask about the resting places, but also bring out the topic of the awesome and interesting efforts to save species that are on the brink of extinction. But to couple that list, habitat restoration because if you save the species but they don't have a place to live, it's kind of a lost cause. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that too. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Zack, thanks very much. JOE DUFF : Well, the first question is the migration and how we choose it. Basically, we're using a historic whooping crane migration. We know not the exact route, but we know they were in all the states that we pass through. And the wild whooping cranes are soaring birds. They may take off in one of those days with lots of fluffy clouds and thermal. They fly like a hawk or an eagle. They'll climb up on a warm column of air without expending any energy. They glide to the next one, and they can cover two or 300 miles that way. JOE DUFF : We don't have the capacity to fly that way. We don't have the fuel range. We don't have the ability to soar the way they do, so we fly in the very calm air of first thing in the morning. And as we plow through the air, our aircraft creates a wake in the air much the way a boat would and the birds learn to fly on that wake. So our lead bird maybe only inches from the wingtip, and they soar along getting a free ride that way. That can only happen when the air is calm. JOE DUFF : As soon as, you know, the winds start to pick up midday, then the wing bounces around too much. The birds can't follow it. In order to follow us, they have to move away from the wing. That means they have to flap fly and they get tired. So we only get maybe an hour or two the first thing in the morning. And birds fly around 38 miles an hour, so we can get maybe 50 to 100 miles on a good day. And at each stopover site, we have most of them around private property. People know we're coming. They've opened their homes and their property to us. JOE DUFF : We have an area that's isolated where we can put the pen, and we tend them for the rest of the day and then go the next the day if the weather allows. On average, to cover the 1,285 miles from Wisconsin to Florida, takes us about 25 flying days, but it may take us upwards of 100 days to get those 25 flying days. So that's the process. Now, in the way back, of course, they can make it in a much shorter time when they're flying their own, so... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Because bad weather, you can't fly at all. JOE DUFF : Bad weather, we can't fly at all. In fact, this year, we've had some particularly bad weather. We were stuck in Illinois at a private landowner's home for 16 days in high winds. We got a one-day break. We traveled 67 miles, and we were stuck for another 10 days, so... NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. We're talking with Joe Duff of the Operation Migration. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Pat's on the line, Pat calling from Fleming Island in Florida. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### PAT : Yes. I heard - I think I just read it recently that the FAA got involved and didn't like the idea of you guys flying for pay. Is there any truth to that? NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think you tuned in late. We discussed this earlier, but, Joe Duff, he'd like to clarify. JOE DUFF : Yes, sir. The type of aircraft we fly used to be called ultralight aircraft. And there's a new regulation out, started in 2008 called the light-sport category. And that's the category our aircraft fit in, and the rules that go along with that category say that you cannot fly an aircraft like that for hire, and you cannot fly an aircraft like that for the furtherance of a business. And, of course, Operation Migration as a non-profit is a business. So as we said earlier, the rules are open to interpretation. We felt that we were compliant with the rules, but the FAA responded to a complaint and they have to investigate, and so they are doing that. JOE DUFF : They are working closely with us, hopefully, to issue a waiver exempting us from those rules because of the benefit that it has to the American people. We're reintroducing an endangered species. We're promoting conservation of wetland habitat. We're promoting the conservation education. So, you know, through partner organization journeying north, we reached 1.6 million school-aged kids every year with lesson plans all based on this project. So it is - it has major benefits to the American people, so that's one of the criteria for an exemption. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Leslie, Leslie with us from West Michigan. LESLIE : West Bloomfield, Michigan. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, go ahead, please. LESLIE : Anyways, I got a ton of questions. Number one, what does a whooping crane look like? Number two, what happened to the original flock in the 1800s? Where they killed off by humans, or did they die from disease? Number three... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Why don't we pause there, Leslie, and let him get an answer to the first two. JOE DUFF : OK. Well, a whooping crane is the tallest bird in North America. It's about 5 feet tall. It has a 7 foot wingspan. If you've seen sandhill cranes - there's two kinds of cranes in North America and we have - coincidentally the most plentiful, which is the sandhill crane and the most endangered, which is the whooping crane. The sandhill crane is kind of gray all over. Usually, a whooping crane is pure white. It has black primary feathers and a red patch on its forehead, so it's a very distinctive-looking bird and what we call the white ghost of the wetlands. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And the - what happened to the original flock? JOE DUFF : Well, you know, back in the 1940s, a conservation isn't what it is now, you know? People didn't realize that, you know, our grandparents and our great grandparents thought that everything out there was theirs for the harvesting. And we now have a better understanding of conservation and natural resources. So, you know, back in the 1800s when they discovered that many birds were endangered, a lot of museums sent out trappers to get the last example so they'd have some. JOE DUFF : So, it's just the whole concept that conservation has changed now and the, you know, the hunting regulations have come in. And, in fact, hunters are probably one of the biggest conservationists of all. The taxes they pay on hunting licenses and ammunition is what funds most of the conservation projects out there. So it's just a change of attitude, but basically, it was lost of habitat and overhunting before there were regulations, back when, you know, you needed to hunt for food. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Leslie, you have time for one more. LESLIE : Oh, oh, good. I was going to ask how did these regulations affect the previous migration, and I guess it's going to - when is this exemption going to be issued by the, you know, the next migration. And last and just real quickly, I'd like to get some more information for my daughter's class because they're studying environment and ecology and habitat and all that other stuff. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right. Thanks very much for the call, Leslie. JOE DUFF : Well, as far that when this is going to happen, we don't know. The normal process, first, an exemption is 120 days. We're hoping the FAA will speed that up. We've got a lot of support out there and people are calling in and asking them to speed the process. But I think they're working hard.

That's where we invite interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. Today, we want to talk about a subject that's been percolating in the wake of the news that the Virginia governor and the attorney general were blackface at parties years ago. Another Virginia official was the editor of a yearbook with many such racist photos in it. The - Governor Ralph Northam has been pressed to resign, even by members of his own Democratic Party. But instead of doing that, the governor sees a teachable moment. RALPH NORTHAM : This is really an opportunity, I believe, to make awareness of this issue, to really have a frank dialogue and discussion about race and equity in this country. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : He was speaking to CBS News there. And one way he plans to do this is through a series of talks to engage the public on race, something of a reconciliation tour. Virginia Union University, an historically black institution in Richmond, will be his first stop. In a written statement, the university wrote, it is important to bring the community together to develop a plan to reach healing and reconciliation. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So that's what we wanted to talk about. What does reconciliation look like? How might it be achieved? And we've called on three people who have thought about this and who have worked on this. Rich Harwood is the president and founder of The Harwood Institute for Public Innovation. That's an organization that facilitates community discussions around difficult issues. He's with us in our studios in Washington, D.C. Welcome back. RICH HARWOOD : Good to be with you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Russell Moore is president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. He has been involved in dealing with the convention's complicated history on race. He is with us from his office in Nashville, Tenn. Thank you for joining us once again, Pastor Moore. RUSSELL MOORE : Thanks for having me. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : And, finally, Sharon Leslie Morgan is a genealogist who's been seeking racial reconciliation by tracing her multiracial ancestry. And she's with us from her home in Mississippi. And Sharon Leslie Morgan, thank you as well. SHARON LESLIE MORGAN : Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : And I'm going to start with Rich Harwood. You wrote a very interesting piece for your blog, in which you said that confronting racism and identity in this country will involve sorrow and that the conversation will not be polite. And so I wanted to ask you about that. Is this governor - is this tour, this series of discussions that the governor - that Governor Northam's talking about - is that a good first step? RICH HARWOOD : Well, I think he faces a fundamental choice. If this is about political survival for his governorship, no. If this is about him being an instrument of society, potentially. And I think what he needs to be prepared for is that this will not be a civil conversation. We can't ask people to engage in civility here because that just means lower your voice, don't be emotional. This is an incredibly emotional topic. People feel loss. They feel anger. They feel a sense of rage. This has been coming for generations. And I think he needs to be prepared for a very hard-nosed, tough emotional conversation that's coming his way. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : Is that going to be fruitful? RICH HARWOOD : I think we can only engage in a fruitful conversation if we allow this kind of sorrow, this kind of emotion, this rage and anger to come forward. Otherwise, folks who have been discriminated against, who have dealt with inequities for their lives will say this is yet another effort in lip service from a white politician who's simply trying to survive, politically. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So, you know, Pastor Moore, you've already done some hard work on this issue yourself. I mean, you've said that Southern Baptists have been complicit in racism and bolstering racial pride among Southern whites. And I wanted to ask you - how has that gone as you have tried to address this at the convention? What have your experiences been? RUSSELL MOORE : Well, I see the best of times and the worst of times happening, simultaneously, as they often do. On the one hand, I see God moving many congregations in a very different direction, toward healing and reconciliation and justice. I also, though, am shocked that I will receive white supremacist hate mail that reads almost exactly like that that my predecessor would have received in, say, the 1950s or 1960s. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : That's interesting. I want to hear more about that and how you get people to the table. Let me go to Sharon Leslie Morgan, though. You've been able to find the names of more than two dozen people in your family who were enslaved. And some of those stories and the stories of their descendants, both white and black, are truly painful. I mean, for example, you talk about your white grandmother, who was disowned by her family when one of her children was born with brown skin. I mean, that's just, you know, one story. And yet you've said that tracing your roots has helped you confront the trauma that slavery and racism imposed on your family. I mean, how? SHARON LESLIE MORGAN : The first thing that you have to do is that you have to remember that, first, it hurts. And then, it heals. And one of the things we must do is go back and confront this history that is the legacy that we're living with today. The reason that we have racism and all of the acrimonious feelings between people of different races has a great deal to do with the history of this country and it having been born as a country that embraced slavery. So you have to go back into the past. You have to confront it. You have to experience the pain. And then, you have to use that in a productive way to move forward to the healing. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : So, Pastor, I want to go back to that. And, you know, Sharon just said you have to confront it. As you've just told us a lot of people would really prefer not to. How do you get people to the table? RUSSELL MOORE : Yeah. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST : I mean, is it - do you find that it requires the deep commitment of religious commitment to get people to the table? And even then, when they have that, do they really want to engage? Like, what do you do to get people to the table who are not that interested? \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : President Trump has declared a national emergency because he says that's what it is - an invasion, he called it today, of drugs and criminals coming into our country. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we're going to do it. One way or the other, we have to do it. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : The move allows the president, either through emergency powers or through administrative action, to free up an additional roughly $6 billion to fund a wall at the southern border. Most of that money will come from the Defense Department budget. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Republican Congressman Doug Lamborn is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. His district in Colorado includes two Air Force bases, the Air Force Academy and Fort Carson. And he joins me now. Congressman, welcome. DOUG LAMBORN : Hello. How are you? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I'm well, thank you. And I wonder how you're feeling about billions of dollars being taken from other Defense Department budget lines and diverted to building a wall. DOUG LAMBORN : Well, let me say first of all, Mary Louise, I think the president had no choice to declaring national emergency. Congress did not do its job in recognizing the gravity of the situation and appropriating the proper amount of money to address it. Now, when it comes to him declaring an emergency, he's going to use - tap into several pots of money like drug forfeiture money - I think we would all agree with that - or drug interdiction money. This seems to fit that category. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Although there is a certain irony in that one of the reasons he cites for wanting to build a wall is to fight drug trafficking and the drug trade, and he's taking money from - he's taking money away from those efforts that were already existing in - under the Pentagon umbrella. DOUG LAMBORN : Well, except that when you build a wall and stop the flow of illegal crossings, including drug carriers, that will help curtail the drugs coming into our country. So to me, that's appropriate. Now, you asked about military construction. I do want to see what those projects are. That's my one concern in this whole area. I would hope he would identify other pots of money before he got to military construction because those are well-thought-out projects and those are years in the pipeline. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : This emergency declaration is pulling 3.6 billion from military construction. DOUG LAMBORN : That's right. And if he gets to that because he's identified other money that I think will be used first, we'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it. I know people are going to try to tie it up in the courts, and it'll be months and months before we actually can probably access it - before he can access the money. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Let me ask you, as a member of Congress, a coequal branch of government, does it concern you that in declaring this national emergency, the president is circumventing Congress? DOUG LAMBORN : Well, I will agree that any time a president declares a national emergency - and this is - since 1976, I believe, there is - this has been done 58 times. This is No. 59. The people's representatives need to be vigilant. We need to make sure that it's a genuine emergency. Now, to me, this passes the test. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : As you know it's controversial, whether this is an emergency or not. People fall on both sides of the line. And the law that you stated that, the 1976 law, doesn't explicitly define an emergency. So the president does have this power. But to my question, Congress, you just explicitly voted to deny him these funds. DOUG LAMBORN : Well, I didn't. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : I know that you voted against it, but the overwhelming vote in Congress was that this went through. DOUG LAMBORN : Yeah. And maybe those who voted the other way would feel differently. But I have accepted that this is an emergency and that it's getting worse, Mary Louise. The composition of people, there's a lot more minors and families coming - the caravans with thousands of people. That's a new process. So I'm seeing that the problem is actually getting worse. So I accept the president's declaration. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : And just - we just have time for a sentence - a one-sentence answer - but to the question of whether this raises real questions about democracy and coequal branches of government. DOUG LAMBORN : There's no crisis here. I think everything is working as it's intended. I will be supporting the president. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : All right. Congressman, thank you. \n\n ###",

Welcome back to the studio. MATTHEW YGLESIAS : Glad to be here. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : And David Brooks of The New York Times - welcome back, David. DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE : Good to be here. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : OK, so let's talk about the response. First of all, it was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who announced this yesterday, and people were trying to read something into McConnell being the one to say this since it had been reported that he was against the idea. David, what was your read on what the majority leader was doing? DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE : Well, I've lived through many - we've had many national emergencies - Valley Forge, Pearl Harbor, now the battle for Donald Trump's ego. I don't think this is anything like a national emergency. It's just - he's awarding himself a performance trophy because he lost the shutdown. And so there's more to me about his state of mind. DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE : I don't think there's a Republican senator in the Senate who in - deep in his heart of hearts thinks this is anything other than a gross attack on any concept of conservative governance and the Constitution. But this was the prize they gave Trump in exchange for really not inviting him to be part of the - to the budget negotiations. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Matthew? MATTHEW YGLESIAS : Well, I mean, it's extremely telling that in the actual budget negotiations, they not only didn't give the $5.6 billion that Trump had been asking for. They came up with a money - money for border security that was less than the deal he had rejected months ago, right? So you can tell Senate Republicans were not that invested in this whole concept. And I think they reached the conclusion that letting Trump or saying that they would support the emergency declaration was the quickest way out of this. And then we're going to leave it for the courts to sort out. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Now, we know that Democrats have said that they want to essentially file a resolution that could block the president from doing this. We also heard Nancy Pelosi's response, which was very specific. I want to play it for you. NANCY PELOSI : Let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in America. That's a national emergency. Why don't you declare that emergency, Mr. President? I wish you would. But a Democratic president can do that. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : That little not-so-subtle reminder that this could be a tool that could be wielded by a Democratic president, and you guys should all think about that - is this a moment for Republicans to reassert authority over the party, to basically take that step. If you say, David, that they are all against, are we really going to see them be - put the vote on the line? DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE : They probably will not. They should, but they are supine. They did have the guts not to really invite anybody from the White House to negotiations. They do not have the guts to stand up to Donald Trump publicly. And so you're seeing a lot of Republicans who warned him not to do this suddenly embracing it. DAVID BROOKS, BYLINE : You'll see an awful lot of Republicans who were really apoplectic when Barack Obama did something remotely like this about immigration and the DREAMers, but they - the - it has been an erosion of institutional power in Congress over the last 20 or 30 years. I do not know why they don't seize power. They were elected just like anybody else. But for some reason, they almost run away from any seizure of their constitutional rights. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Matthew, I don't know what that leaves you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : David Brooks calls everyone supine and says, give it up, guys. MATTHEW YGLESIAS : I think it's important to understand, though, that Pelosi and Democrats to some extent are posturing here. There's no legal mechanism through which a president could use a state of emergency to take meaningful gun control actions, right? I mean, this is a real statutory authority. The emergency is fake. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : But her use of that example is not subtle, right? I mean, she's trying to use some keywords there that should terrify conservatives. MATTHEW YGLESIAS : Exactly. I just - I don't think it's realistic. I mean, don't expect the next Democratic president to actually do that. I think what you should expect is a new round of appropriations fights, right? Trump is using emergency declarations to raid a military construction fund and a drug interdiction fund in order to do wall construction. MATTHEW YGLESIAS : If Democrats lose in the courts, they're going to come back to Congress next year, and they're going to attach a legal stipulation to the military construction fund saying under no circumstances going to be used for border security or else they're going to not want to appropriate money for military construction at all. There's no ultimate loophole out of the conflict with Congress here. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We already know it is so cold that mail service was suspended in many places. And now we can add this. In Minneapolis, it is so cold, UPS driver Brendan Pena (ph) was told the decision to deliver packages is just up to him. BRENDAN PENA : Boss has basically told us, at any point you feel like you don't want to work or it's too cold you can't feel your fingers, you can't feel your nose, your face, come back to the building. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Good rule of thumb. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Or of nose, anyway. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In nearby St. Paul, Minn., firefighters were told to work in 10-minute rotations. They are fighting a fire, with all the heat that it produces, and it was still so cold that 10 minutes was the maximum they could be outside. Even in places where it was a bit less cold, National Weather Service meteorologist Trent Frey has this warning. TRENT FREY : Frostbite becomes a major concern for any exposed skin on the matter of about 15 minutes or so. You know, any prolonged exposure can be deadly in this case. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We should say at least eight people have died in connection with this cold weather. It is a good day to check on people who are home alone. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Which is why I called my mom in Indiana, where temperatures were 6 below zero this morning, which would seem warm compared with La Crosse, Wis., where it is 30 below today. And that is where we find Wisconsin Public Radio's Hope Kirwan. Hope, good morning. HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : I guess this is the moment when you could say, oh, it's Wisconsin, we're used to cold weather. Are you saying that? HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE : No, I don't think people are saying that here in the state. Actually, Governor Tony Evers issued a state of emergency - declared a state of emergency earlier this week because of the cold temperatures. You know, we saw some wind chills get down to -55 degrees; that's 55 below zero. And so, you know, that's obviously a huge risk to people's health. And, you know, a lot of things were canceled yesterday and into today. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : You know, I noticed that here, where the temperatures were above zero but in the teens, it actually feels kind of nice if there's no wind blowing. But the second there's the slightest puff of wind, you want to get out of there. Is that what it's like there, only worse? HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE : Yeah. I mean, it's definitely that classic you feel just kind of your face freezing - any exposed skin that's, you know, exposed to the cold definitely constricts. And, you know, you immediately feel it as soon as you step outside. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : I would imagine that this is immediately a perilous situation if somebody's heat goes off. How are authorities making sure the heat stays on in Wisconsin? HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE : Well, we did see some outages - some power outages on Wednesday morning just due to power lines breaking because of the heat. But, you know, really, people are just encouraging people to keep their thermostats at a comfortable level and to just constantly check on pipes - water pipes and faucets, as well. That can be another, you know, just kind of infrastructure-related problem. And so people are just really, you know, encouraging people who are low-income to keep their thermostat up and worry about paying the utility bill later. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : In my hometown, I was told the schools are closed, of course, but the school buildings have remained open. People can go there if the heat goes off. Are people doing things like that where you are? HOPE KIRWAN, BYLINE : Yeah, a lot of places have opened as emergency warming shelters. A police department in the town where I'm at actually opened, and it's open to anyone who needs to have a warm place. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Hope, I hope you are somewhere warm, at this moment, anyway. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The social media giant faces yet another one. Both Facebook and Google, we should note, were exposed for getting around efforts to limit their harvesting of data. The companies offered cash and other gift incentives to users who would then allow apps on their phones that monitor almost everything that they do on their phones. Facebook was targeting users as young as 13 with this. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It is the latest in a string of revelations about privacy issues the company has faced, but they're still making money. Facebook announced record profits in its fourth quarter yesterday. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Jasmine Garsd has been covering this story from New York. Jasmine, good morning. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : First, what does this mean - an app on your phone that monitors almost everything? JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Yeah, so both - in both these cases, these were apps which users gave permission for their data to be collected. And the point is for these companies to understand users better. Now, in the case of Facebook, it was particularly invasive. I mean, participants were giving permission to have pretty much everything monitored - social media messages, Internet activity, what other apps you have on your phone. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Although somebody might say, well, people opted in to do this and got some kind of compensation for it. Why is that a big deal? JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Well, absolutely. I mean, in the case of Facebook, they were targeting a very young audience, some as young as 13. And there's the argument that, yeah, they knew what they were getting into. I mean, but really, who is reading the fine print? That's what tech activists would say. It's probably not a 13-year-old. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : And then there's the fact that Facebook keeps breaking Apple's terms and conditions with this kind of behavior. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, let's remember here, of course, Apple, huge maker of iPhones. They like to promote the iPhone as a refuge, a relatively private place. And they'd been trying to keep Facebook from doing this sort of thing. What's Apple have to say now? JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Well, you know, on Wednesday, Google took down its own app, and Apple banned Facebook's app. It also banned several of Facebook's internal apps - you know, the ones used by employees in-house. Facebook and Apple have reportedly had a very chilly relationship precisely because of this - because Apple is uncomfortable with Facebook's constant disregard of privacy issue. There's a history here. Here's Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly chastising Facebook. TIM COOK : We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer. But you are not our product. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Just a different business model. JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Yeah. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And so what is - when you say there's a history here, how have the two companies argued back-and-forth over time? JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE : Well, essentially, Tim Cook has said, you know, we don't want people to be our product. And Facebook very much gets its profit off of advertising. That's where Facebook's money comes from. And so Facebook is constantly in this conundrum of how to respect people's privacy while still making a profit. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. So you just mentioned profit. Help me understand this. Facebook faces way more than a year - a couple years of horribly embarrassing headlines, congressional hearings, yet another scandal, and they just posted record profits. \n\n ###",

And I think it speaks to a younger generation that grew up with a very different concept of privacy than the rest of us. And they're going to have to grapple with this question of, when is it enough?

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Some other news now - how much pressure does China really face to end a trade war? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : The U.S. and China are in trade talks this week. President Trump is demanding big changes. He's already imposed tariffs on many billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports. He is threatening to raise those tariffs in these talks that are happening this week and if those talks fail to force big changes in Chinese economic policies. Economists have pointed out that it's really American consumers who pay the taxes on imports, but it's also true China's economy is slowing down. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us now from Shanghai. Hey there, Rob. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : Good morning, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. So these talks are taking place in Washington, right? There's a Chinese delegation here, where I am. And the head of that delegation meets President Trump himself. What's on their agenda? ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : So the head of the delegation is Liu He. And he's looking for a couple of things for China today. He's going to gauge President Trump on what China needs to do to make Trump comfortable about making a trade deal. He's also looking for how serious President Trump is on making that deal. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : I spoke with China expert Bill Bishop about this, and he pointed out that from Liu's perspective, the Chinese delegation thought they had a deal in 2017 after meeting with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. And last year, they thought they had a deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But... BILL BISHOP : In both cases, President Trump said, it's not enough, and blew up the deal. And so I think they're very nervous that, unless they can get in the room and get the president to say, we're done, that they're going to be basically embarrassed yet again. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : This is something that the president's allies in Congress have had the same complaint about - that it's hard to know what he really wants, hard to get him on the record and keep him there. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : Yeah, Steve. And what Bill means by getting him in the room here is that he thinks one of Liu's goals today will be to convince President Trump to meet with Xi Jinping to make a deal. And if you look at the president's calendar, he does have an outstanding meeting planned with Kim Jong Un somewhere in Asia in the near future, so perhaps the thinking here is to have President Trump swing by Beijing at that time to put an end to this trade war once and for all. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : The hope of imposing these tariffs is that China would feel pain and feel more and more pressure over time to make a deal. Is it working out that way? ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : China's economy is hurting. Just last night, in fact, more than 400 Chinese companies posted profit-loss warnings for 2018. And the impact from the trade war has only started. So the Chinese are likely prepared to make some concessions on items, like IP protection and reducing the trade deficit. ROB SCHMITZ, BYLINE : What's probably not going to happen that the U.S. is looking for is China making structural changes to its economy and reducing the power of its state-owned enterprises that are blamed for creating this unfair playing field for U.S. businesses. China's Communist Party exerts economic and political control through these companies. And Xi Jinping is unlikely to cede that to the Trump administration. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, OK. So structural changes - no. What about changes to the use of trade secrets or the stealing of trade secrets or the handing over of trade information? Is China willing to change that? \n\n ###",

That's the question reverberating around Washington and through the country today. Will President Trump sign the budget deal that a bipartisan group of lawmakers has hammered out? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : The president has said he is not happy with the spending bill. It includes only a fraction of the 5.7 billion he wanted for a border wall, a border wall that was the centerpiece of candidate Donald Trump's campaign promise to stop illegal immigration. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : As the executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, Mark Krikorian has spent much of his career advocating for more restrictive immigration policies. And he joins me now in the studio. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. MARK KRIKORIAN : Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So the president says, you know - not wild about the deal, not happy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says pretty good deal. From where you sit, policy-wise, is it a good deal? MARK KRIKORIAN : It's - I wouldn't even say it's a half-full glass, but it's got a few teaspoons in it, I think is the way I'd talk about it. So I expect the president probably will sign it. But the responsible thing to do would be to have an extension of the current funding for a week for people to be able to read what's in the bill because... AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So you want to talk more. MARK KRIKORIAN : Yeah, because - I don't mean negotiate more. I mean actually see what they've come up with because it's going to be a thousand or more pages long, and it deals with other government agencies, as well. And it's just not responsible to, you know, get a thousand page piece of legislation and, 24 hours later, have to vote on it. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : In the meantime, there's, say, an executive action to bypass Congress and divert money into wall construction. There's a possibility of declaring a national emergency. There is executive authority to tap funds elsewhere. The White House has a lot of options, and they've alluded to the idea that they might be willing to use them. Do you think that is the right move? MARK KRIKORIAN : I think they're likely to not necessarily declare a national emergency. I think that's something that would set a really problematic precedent for future presidents. I mean, if Kamala Harris were president, then what does she do with that authority? You see what I mean? But there are other authorities, short of declaring a national emergency, where the president can reallocate certain money to build some more fencing, for instance. I expect he probably will do some of that. It may be challenged in court. Who knows? But I think the most - the national emergency idea, I think, is probably a bridge too far because of the precedent it would set. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : So basically, your objection to that is, when you're not the party in power, that becomes a lot less appealing. MARK KRIKORIAN : That's why you have a lot of the protections, whether it's in legislative or executive branch - because you don't want to be on the receiving end of things like that because you're not always going to be in power. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : You've said you're not a wall or bust guy. But why do you think the wall's such important shorthand? MARK KRIKORIAN : It's shorthand - it's not symbolic because we actually do need more fencing, more barriers on the border. But it was, I think, a way for the president to communicate to people during the campaign that he was serious about border enforcement, unlike other candidates before him. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Is it a problem now? MARK KRIKORIAN : Yeah, I think he's - the problem is he kind of talked himself into a box by emphasizing the wall so much. And you know, the - I mean, while it's important, there are other measures that are more important - change if - plugging loopholes in asylum law; the E-Verify system, which makes it harder for illegal immigrants to get jobs. Those kinds of things, in my opinion, are clearly higher priority than more fencing, as valuable as increased fencing in certain areas would be. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : At the same time, this administration has faced several legal setbacks when it has tried to draw restrictions around immigration or asylum. From where you sit, are they making progress for the agenda for people who want restrictive immigration policy? MARK KRIKORIAN : I think the answer is yes. The difference is that when this administration started, both its supporters and opponents thought this would be a kind of shock and awe, you know, rolling over the opposition, when in fact, this is more a matter of trench warfare, metaphorically. And so success is going to be measured in inches and feet, not in overwhelming, you know, triumphs. And so, you know, they've been - you know, they've gained some inches and some feet here and there. So in my opinion, the direction is right, but the degree of success obviously has been pretty limited. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST : Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Thank you for coming in. MARK KRIKORIAN : Thank you. \n\n ###",

But tariffs can also affect people on an individual level. Nowhere is that more apparent than in America's agricultural communities. Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia are the hosts of the podcast The Indicator from Planet Money, and they spoke with one farmer whose livelihood is now on the frontlines of a trade war. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : David Reed farms more than 2,000 acres of peanuts and cotton here in Pinehurst, Ga. And when his crop started coming in last year, he says, it was glorious. DAVID REED : Oh, yeah. We had the best crop we ever had in 50 years. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And then, starting over the summer, a couple of things happened. First, a trade war broke out. The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and China retaliated with import taxes of its own. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : Among the U.S. goods that China started taxing were peanut butter and cotton, basically everything they grow in this part of Georgia. And then a couple of months later, this happened. BROOKE BALDWIN : Hi, there. I'm Brooke Baldwin live here in Destin, Fla., where we are covering the official landfall of Hurricane Michael. BROOKE BALDWIN : UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: You can feel the ferocity. I'm sorry. I'm... BROOKE BALDWIN : UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Getting sustained Category 4 hurricane winds coming in. This is epic. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : David lost about a third of his cotton crop and a couple of fields of peanuts, too. DAVID REED : See the peanuts on the ground there? That's what was left. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Left after the storm. Peanuts grow underground like potatoes, and this field has peanuts all over the dirt. David picked a couple up, but they were rotten from all the water from the storm. The shell was kind of soft. It came apart in his hands. DAVID REED : See; that was a good peanut when it came out. But it just somehow - we didn't get it picked till after the storm hit. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : The peanuts and cotton that did survive walked straight out of a storm and into a trade war. China's peanut butter and cotton orders from the U.S. collapsed overnight. And the price that David was getting for his peanuts and cotton both fell by about 30 percent. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : And what had been shaping up to be one of the best years in David's entire farming career turned into one of the worst years he'd ever seen. DAVID REED : You know, we had planned to make a lot of money this year, but the Lord didn't see fit for it. But hopefully, we're going to break even. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE : Break even. And David says he is one of the lucky ones. DAVID REED : There's some farmers just worried. You know, I've heard them talk and say, I don't know if I'm going to survive this or not. And you know, it's heartbreaking. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : And David says that the economic effects of the storm and the tariffs haven't just hit the farmers. They've hit the whole area. DAVID REED : It's hurting the whole community and the equipment dealers and the guy down the street with the hardware store, and everybody suffers. CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE : In spite of everything, though, David actually supports the tariffs. \n\n ###",

In the Yuma, Ariz., sector, the number of migrant families crossing the border more than doubled last year. And, as NPR's Joel Rose reports, that is straining resources in the U.S. and in Mexico. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : We're flying high above the border fence separating Yuma County, Ariz., from Mexico. Barbie Moorhouse is at the controls of a Border Patrol helicopter. BARBIE MOORHOUSE : The systems are all green, and the lights are all on. We're good to go. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Before she was a pilot, Moorhouse worked on the ground as a Border Patrol agent in the mid-2000s. Back then, Moorhouse says agents ran themselves ragged chasing migrants trying to cross illegally. BARBIE MOORHOUSE : It was just, to me, like the wild, Wild West. It was just out of control. We did the best we could with what we had at the time. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Since then, the Border Patrol ranks have swelled. More miles of wall have been built, and the number of illegal border crossings has fallen to just a fraction of what it was a decade ago. But today, the face of those migrants has changed. Instead of farm workers and laborers trying to dodge agents, nearly 90 percent of the border crossers are families, many fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. They're trying to get caught to present themselves to agents and ask for asylum. And once again, the U.S. is not prepared. ANTHONY PORVAZNIK : It is a crisis for us because this is a situation that the Border Patrol is not resourced or geared to deal with. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Anthony Porvaznik is the chief patrol agent in Yuma. He says the number of migrant families crossing in his sector is on pace to double again this year. Porvaznik says his agents are spending hours caring for the migrants in their custody, picking up hundreds of hamburgers at a time from McDonald's and waiting with them at the hospital if they need medical attention. ANTHONY PORVAZNIK : We need additional manpower to deal with the population that we have to essentially babysit, and that takes Border Patrol agents away from a national security, border security mission to deal with a humanitarian mission. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : The White House has asked for $800 million in humanitarian aid for the border and for more agents. Congress is still trying to hammer out the details, including funding for more border wall though far less than what the president wanted. But none of that is likely to stop these migrant families. And it's not just the Border Patrol that is scrambling to adjust. About half a mile south of the border in a town called San Luis Rio Colorado, Martin Salgado runs a small migrant shelter. MARTIN SALGADO : This house was made originally for men. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Salgado says it was primarily a weigh station for migrant men trying to get to the U.S. to work. But now Salgado says the majority of migrants are women and children seeking asylum. MARTIN SALGADO : From a year ago, there's a lot of women - a lot, a lot of women and a lot of children. But in the past, you don't see this picture. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : I mean, it sounds like a schoolyard out there. MARTIN SALGADO : Right. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Yeah. MARTIN SALGADO : Right. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Before, this was a place to bunk for a night or two. But now few migrant families are sleeping here. That's because they're afraid to lose their place in line for a chance to apply for asylum at the port of entry. That line has grown longer in recent months as U.S. officials limit applications to just a few families a day. Migrant families return to the shelter just to eat, shower and wash their clothes. ROSIA RAMIREZ PANULOZA : (Through interpreter) These are good people. My own village - I cannot imagine anyone being as helpful and giving. JOEL ROSE, BYLINE : Rosia Ramirez Panuloza (ph) left Guerrero in southern Mexico with her three children. She has two daughters - the youngest 10 months old and a son who's 11. Ramirez says gang members in their hometown tried to recruit him. \n\n ###",

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared on the Senate floor this afternoon and told surprised lawmakers that that is the latest White House plan. That means another government shutdown averted but also means all kinds of political and legal questions come into play in regard to a national emergency. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Let's bring in Matt Schlapp. He is chairman of the American Conservative Union and a longtime supporter of the president. Mr. Schlapp, welcome. MATT SCHLAPP : Great to be with you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Great to have you with us. So what do you make of this strategy? Is this the right way to go? MATT SCHLAPP : It's his only choice. He can't seem to achieve a bipartisan consensus with the Democrats running the House on the need to actually shut down illegal immigration at the southern border. So in order to do that - and we have, as everybody knows 'cause this is publicly available information - you have 60,000 people a month who are approaching that southern border. MATT SCHLAPP : We are at - if you talk to any border security agent, you talk to career officials at the Department of Homeland Security, they'll tell you that it's a different kind of immigration. Some people say, well, the numbers actually aren't higher, but it's a different kind of immigration. It's a type of illegal immigration and asylum claims that really put stress on the entire process because the countries they come from... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You're saying you agree that the situation at the border is a national emergency. MATT SCHLAPP : I agree that the situation at the border is an emergency. It's a humanitarian crisis, and America needs to solve the problem. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : And I - and I'm just trying to square that because when we interview members of Congress - Republicans and Democrats who represent the border - they say it's not an emergency. MATT SCHLAPP : Well, then why did two kids die? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Well, I don't know which two kids you're referring to. And we can talk... MATT SCHLAPP : Well, it was well-covered. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...About isolated... MATT SCHLAPP : It was well-covered... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...Incidents. MATT SCHLAPP : ...On NPR that two kids in two separate...

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...Would not have averted that in any way... MATT SCHLAPP : That's untrue. The reason... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...As tragic as it was. MATT SCHLAPP : No, and that's just one of the ways in which it's an emergency. I mean, if you talk about - I remember during this whole process when kids were separated from their parents, and I remember listening to NPR talk about it in terms of humanitarian crisis. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Let me - because people can cite statistics, cases to support any number of actions. And of course, again - a tragedy that those two children died at the border. But let me ask you about... MATT SCHLAPP : Terrible tragedy. I... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : Of course, absolutely. MATT SCHLAPP : I'd like to make sure no other kids die. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : As would everyone. I think that's - that goes without saying. As a political strategy, let me ask you this. What risk does setting a precedent like this run if the next time around it's a Democrat in the White House or somebody... MATT SCHLAPP : Well... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...You don't agree with... MATT SCHLAPP : Yeah, no, it's a great... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : ...Being able to declare a national emergency when it's not something obvious like 9/11. MATT SCHLAPP : Well, I agree with you. I don't like the concept of the president using a pen and a phone - right? - which is what so many conservatives complained about Barack Obama - that he'd simply - when the Republicans in Congress wouldn't do what he wanted, he simply would sidestep them and go around them, and he did it on issue after issue. So it's a very fair question. I think most conservatives don't like the idea of a president declaring an emergency. MATT SCHLAPP : The problem is at the southern border - is that the ultimate authority for making sure that we don't have chaos at the southern border relies with the executive, with whoever the people of the United States select to be their president.

MATT SCHLAPP : I'm not crazy about the precedent. I don't think he has to declare a national emergency to build the wall. But the problem - the wall is only a part of the solution - might not even be the most important part, but it's a - it is an important part of it. I don't think we need wall everywhere. I mean, we have 600 miles of wall now, and I think the president's proposal was 200 miles additional. So it's actually pretty modest when you look at what the problem is. MATT SCHLAPP : But the bigger problem we have is we have - are we have passed laws that allow people to hover either around the border or be released into the mainland here in America under dubious legal standards. And we have to take care... MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST : You're referring to other reforms that people would like to see at the border. May I... MATT SCHLAPP : No, I'm talking about the current law.

Authorities say they made the largest seizure in U.S. history of a shipment of fentanyl. That's an opioid blamed for many overdose deaths. But the drugs were found in a truck crossing at a legal port of entry. That's how most drugs are said to cross the border, meaning President Trump's proposed border wall would not have stopped this shipment from coming in. This case illustrates the conflict over border security. Republican and Democratic lawmakers say they can agree on measures like better technology at ports of entry. It is not clear they can satisfy the president's demand to pay for a wall that he once promised Mexico would pay for. The president is hinting that if Congress doesn't give him money for the wall, he will declare a state of emergency and take it. So what can lawmakers do? I asked Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you absolutely need President Trump to support a compromise, or can you secure a veto-proof majority that would make that unnecessary in case he changes his mind? ROB PORTMAN : Well, as you know, what the White House is saying is that they're likely to invoke a national emergency power to be able to provide funding for their preferred approach to the border security issues rather than going into a shutdown. So I think that's probably more likely now. And there are three issues that have come up. One is, would the courts enjoin such a invocation of presidential power? In other words, would there be a lawsuit and be an injunction? And therefore, the money wouldn't actually go to the border, but it'd be tied up in the courts. I think that's likely from what I know of the way - people who would have standing, including folks along the border, including Democrats in the House as an example. ROB PORTMAN : Second, it does involve the spending coming from somewhere else. So one of the likely avenues would be military construction - you know, projects that Congress has already approved that would have to be delayed or ended because there would need to be funding taken from them. But then there's just the issue of congressional power versus presidential power. Isn't this really a role for Congress? So we'd have to go through all those things. I don't know how that comes out. But Rachel, frankly, I don't see a shutdown as likely. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And what I hear you saying is you'd like to avoid a national emergency declaration by the president. ROB PORTMAN : Yeah. I think far preferable - let's roll up our sleeves and do the work, close these gaps between us on the border, both literally and figuratively. We're not that far apart. It's just a question of what kind of structures and where they go. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Meanwhile, some federal workers who had been furloughed are still waiting for their back pay, pay they were denied during the shutdown. Many contractors aren't going to be paid at all. You have now introduced a bill to prevent this from happening again. You think that's really necessary. ROB PORTMAN : Yeah. I think shutdowns are stupid. I've felt so for a long time. As you know, this is the fifth time they've introduced my legislation, which is called End Government Shutdowns, a very creative title. It basically says that when you get to the end of an appropriations bill, you don't shut down the government, but instead, you continue the funding from the previous year. Now, some of them said, well, that's bad because you want Congress to appropriate. I agree with that totally. That's why in our legislation, after four months, there is a 1 percent across-the-board cut in all spending. And that will encourage Congress to do its work. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you think after five times of proposing the same legislation, this moment is different? ROB PORTMAN : I do. I mean, look; I've talked to Republicans and Democrats alike. It's really not helping anybody. And for those who are more interested in reducing the size and scope of government, that's not what happens in these. Actually, the taxpayer, in my experience, having lived through about six of these shutdowns now, end up paying more because, again, you come back after the fact and pay people, often paying people for services that were not provided. So it's a hardship for federal employees and their families. It's a hardship for a lot of small businesses that can't get paid for the government work. And it's a hardship for a lot of taxpayers who aren't getting their services. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Can I ask, though, Senator - you understand the raw politics, though, of this. And what do you say to Republicans, even some Democrats, who argue that passing a bill like the one you're suggesting removes important leverage in spending negotiations? ROB PORTMAN : Again, I've been through a few of them, and I've seen what happens, and a lot of people go into them thinking it's going to provide great leverage. I don't think it does. I don't think Chuck Schumer believes that when he got accused of having the Schumer shutdown a year or so ago, which was when he blocked a continuing resolution on behalf of a specific issue. I don't think that many Republicans see it as leverage now, having just gone through this last 35 days and seen the response and reaction from the American people and from the other parties. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, speaking to us yesterday. I want to bring in NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Scott, Senator Portman wants to pass this bill to make sure government shutdowns don't happen again. But that's exactly what's going to happen if Congress doesn't come up with a deal. Has the president already made up his mind that he's going to declare a national emergency, or is this just more posturing? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : That's a very good question, Rachel. You know, he - the president gave an interview to The New York Times yesterday in which he seemed to suggest that he is leaning towards declaring a national emergency. But you have to take that with a big grain of salt because of course, the - he's been hinting at that ever since this standoff began, and he hasn't pulled the trigger yet. The White House, like Senator Portman, knows that a national emergency would invite an immediate legal challenge. There would be opposition from some members of the president's own party, both on sort of constitutional and economic grounds. So it's not entirely clear the president's going to do that. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : And even talking about using a national emergency sort of undercuts the bargaining position of the Republicans on that conference committee. So it's an interesting stance for the president to be taking. You know, Senator Portman used to be a White House budget director, so he knows about the cost of shutdowns not only from a political point of view of a lawmaker, but the budget director is the guy who kind of has to manage a shutdown in the White House. And so he's certainly familiar with the cost on that end, as well. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Just briefly, is Portman right? Have Democrats and Republicans all along been closer than the rhetoric indicates? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : Sure. This is a - you know, this has been a political point for the White House that there was a deal in Congress before this shutdown ever began. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Thanks. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE : You're welcome. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : COLIN O'BRADY: 2:25 p.m. local time Chilean on December 26, 2018 - I just made history. This was such a hard journey. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Indeed, it was. The Oregon native had spent 54 days dragging a sled across Antarctica's vastness, covering more than 930 miles, with no help from wind kites, no supply drops. He is now back home in the slightly warmer climate of Portland, Ore. And I had a chance to catch up with him. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What were the biggest threats in your mind setting out? And then, did those match the reality of what the threats actually were? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: We named our project The Impossible First, and the reason we named it that is it's sort of been talked about, as well as written about, as this project is impossible. And so for me, that was the biggest challenge was getting the food right, getting the nutrition right, getting my body in a place that could not only carry the weight but it meant that I had to - I couldn't take any days off. If I took a day off, I'd be eating food in my sled and using my supplies, and there was already such a limited amount. So it meant every single day, I had to get up and move no matter what the weather was doing. You know, 50, 60-mile-per-hour winds, I was out there, which meant, you know, windchill of minus 70, minus 80, minus 90 degrees, you know, whiteout conditions. I was moving all day. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : As I still try to wrap my head around this whole endeavor and what you accomplished, did you not have any low points? I mean, was there not a moment when you thought, I don't know if I can do this right now? I don't know if I can put one foot in front of the other. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: Oh, there was tons of low points. You know, early in the expedition, I even, you know, called up my wife and I said, you know, I think we named our project the right thing. And she's like, excuse me? I was like, I think it might be impossible... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: ...You know, just literally, you know, crying in my ski goggles, you know, with the tears freezing on my face from just how cold it was, how hard it was, how heavy my sled was. Early on, you know, dragging 375-pound sled, getting my body used to that, my mind used to the long days and the blank canvas of the endless white was extraordinarily challenging. And then even as far as the, you know, 48th or 49th day, I think there's a video clip. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: I'm kind of down in my mind right now. This is - even though I'm so close, day 48, this is the first time in the project I'm feeling like I just wish I could quit. I'm not doing good but trying to hold it together. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : At that point, there was a storm that had gone five or six days in a row. I hadn't seen anything but complete whiteout. And I can't even see one step in front of me. And I'm getting out of my tent to walk, you know, 12, 13 hours every single day, dragging my sled. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Can you tell me about the final push? Because you had, like, a pace. You were setting out to do a certain number of hours every day. And near the end of it, you just decided that you were going to push way further than anyone even on your team expected you to. right? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: Yeah, absolutely. So I calculated and I thought, you know, I'm about 32 to 36 hours away from finishing this thing. And so it just kind of came over me just this deep knowledge. I was like, wait, I'm not going to stop until I get to the end. And so I went from Christmas morning at 6 a.m. straight through the night. Of course, it's endless sun, so the light just - the sun just stays overhead. But I ended up going 32 1/2 straight hours and nearly 80 miles in one single push to finish this project. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Wow. So you were actually racing against one other man, a former British army captain named Lou Rudd. He ended up finishing two days behind you, but you waited for him, I understand, at the finish line. What was that reunion like? You two had just clearly done something so incredible. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: Yeah. You know, although it was, you know, a competition of sorts, and clearly we were both pushing as hard as we could to become the first to make this crossing, you know, there's a deep camaraderie between two people setting off on a journey like this. When we said goodbye to each other at the drop-off point, we gave each other a big hug and said, hey, hope to see you on the other side safe, sound, successful. Both of us are aware of the risks out there. So in the first week, he went ahead of me, you know, gained a bit of a lead in the first week. And although that was a little bit, you know, challenging mentally, I was also like, OK, stick to my own plan. I actually brought more food than he did. I had a heavier sled because I thought that in the back end I wanted to make sure that I had more energy and didn't run out. And that, you know, compromised a little bit of my speed on the front end. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : But by day six, I had caught up to him. And it was the one time that we saw each other while we were out there. I walked past his tent and in this bizarre, you know, two men in the middle of nowhere in Antarctica just kind of gave this quick wave, walked past him. And I ended up staying in front of him for the rest of the time, all the way through the finish when I became first. And so as I finish this and have been alone for so long, I realized I didn't just want a plane to come pick me up and, you know, cheer my success of being first but rather, you know, give respect and compliment to someone who had completed this journey just a couple days slower than me. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And so it was an incredible reunion when we saw each other. You know, as he goes back to the U.K. and I go back to the U.S., we didn't know each other before this trip and, you know, it's not like we'll be talking every single day, but we certainly will always carry this bond of both having completed this. And it was an extraordinary job by him to make it across as well. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You had a bad accident about a decade ago. Can you talk a little bit about how that pushed you to want to do this journey? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : O'BRADY: Yeah. So 11 years ago, I was in Thailand on a small beach, and, unfortunately, I got really badly burned in a fire. You know, a flaming rope wrapped around my legs, lit my body on fire completely to my neck, had to jump in the ocean to extinguish the flames, which saved my life but not before about 25 percent of my body was burned, predominantly my legs and feet. And the doctors in Thailand warned me that I would never walk again normally. And, you know, through the recovery process of that really guided by my mother, who came into my hospital room and sat with me for many months when I couldn't walk and said not only are you going to walk again, but dream about what you want to do with your life. And so I thought to myself, you know, one day, I want to race a triathlon. One day, I want to be mobile. One day, I want to, you know, do these things. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And so through this long road of recovery, not only did I race raised my first triathlon, but I actually ended up winning my first-ever race 18 months after this burn accident in the Chicago Triathlon. And that just kind of illuminated for me the power that we have that I believe that we have inside of all of us to achieve and accomplish amazing things, particularly when we shift that mindset towards a positive and not be victimized by a situation externally. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And certainly, if you look over the last 10, 11 years of my life and now being the first person to cross Antarctica solo, unsupported, unaided, it just goes to show that maybe one day someone will tell you you'll never walk again normally, but you never know if you keep pushing forward one step at a time what lies for you on the other end of that perseverance. \n\n ###",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. Republican and Democratic leaders are meeting to discuss border security. They need to agree on measures that can pass Congress and win the signature of the president in order to avoid another partial government shutdown in a couple weeks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell describes himself as flexible up to a point. MITCH MCCONNELL : I'm for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction we've seen on full display here the last month and also doesn't bring about a view on the president's part that he needs to declare a national emergency. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : There's a little warning at the end there since the president has threatened to bypass Congress to have a border wall built by declaring an emergency. So that's one negotiation. The other is, if anything, a much bigger deal. Chinese negotiators are in Washington to discuss a way out of a trade war. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Oh, yeah, that. So NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us this morning. Hi, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Hi, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Let's start with the trade negotiations - U.S. top trade negotiators sitting down with their Chinese counterparts. What is supposed to happen today? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Well, the U.S. wants two things. The first thing is they want the trade deficit with China to come down. They want China, in other words, to buy more U.S. soybeans and other commodities. The second thing they want is harder to get. They want China to stop intellectual property theft, stop forcing U.S. companies to turn over their technology secrets. They want to stop China requiring U.S. companies to have a Chinese partner. In other words, they want China to change its business model. That's harder to do. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : The big question is will Donald Trump settle for the first thing? In other words, will he just settle for China buying more soybeans, or will he insist that China makes these structural changes? And then, if the Chinese do agree to do that, how do you verify that? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. And, of course, all this is happening against this backdrop of, you know, the Chinese CFO of Huawei was arrested and all this international - or intellectual property theft that you referred to. I mean, are they - is the U.S. delegation expecting some kind of win out of this, or is this an incremental development? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Well, nobody says that this will be easy. The big question about the Huawei indictments is will that become a bargaining chip in these trade talks? Or to put it another way, how does it not become a bargaining chip? And we don't know the answer to that yet. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Let's pivot and think about the negotiations on Capitol Hill to keep the government open. The team of 17 lawmakers has been tasked with finding a solution that they couldn't find for over a month. President Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, gave this effort a less than 50/50 chance of succeeding. So, I mean, he's undercutting them before they even get going. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Right. Well, the big question is Democrats now have not ruled out spending some kind of money for border security - barriers, a smart wall. They don't want what they say is President Trump's medieval wall. And the president is no longer demanding 2,000 miles of sea-to-shining-sea concrete barrier. He wants a couple billion dollars a year for 200-plus miles of border wall. And the question is, can they come up with a compromise that fudges this difference where both sides can say they won? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you see that opening? MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : I am not sure. I think it's possible we're headed for another impasse, but I don't think we're headed for another shutdown. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : There's just not the appetite for that. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : So you heard Mitch McConnell say he doesn't want the president to declare an emergency. He doesn't - didn't say I'm worried the president will shut down the government again. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR's Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE : Thank you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right. Let's shift our focus over to Venezuela. There are more protests expected there today and more pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to step down. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah. These will be the first mass protests since the opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself as president or was declared by the legislature as president. They said they were following the constitution. Guaido does have the support of the United States and other countries. He - however, President Nicolas Maduro has ordered authorities in Venezuela, the Supreme Court, to put a travel ban on Guaido, and all of his bank accounts have been frozen. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : NPR's Philip Reeves joins us from Caracas, where he's covering all of this political drama. Hey, Phil. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : Hi. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : We've got a delay on the line. We should just note that. So the opposition led by Juan Guaido is calling for these protests. Is there an expectation they could get violent today? PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : Well, there is, yeah. He's calling for people to walk out for two hours out of their homes and offices and shops and so on. And he's calling for it to be a nonviolent protest. You know, he successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets last week, so I expect this will be large. Some areas, we're expecting crowds; others may just be people on the streets banging pots and pans. We don't know how Maduro's security forces are going to react. According to the U.N. Human Rights Office, 40 people have been killed since this crisis really erupted nine days ago, most by Venezuela security services. And yeah, the worry is that there will be more bloodshed. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I mean, Maduro has told the Supreme Court to put this travel ban on the opposition leader, Juan Guaido. At the same time, Maduro says he's open to negotiating, but that doesn't seem like a negotiating kind of posture, to tell your opposition that, you know, your bank accounts are frozen and you can't go anywhere. What are the odds that these two men actually get in a room? PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : Well, let's not forget that Maduro accuses Guaido of staging an attempted coup with U.S. collaboration. So a travel ban (laughter) is kind of rather a light response. Most countries, you would be in jail if you were also at the same time summoning huge crowds out in the street to support you. So I think Maduro is trying to feel his way here. He talks about negotiating, but, you know, I can't see how the opposition will do that with a man they don't recognize as president, unless it's a specific discussion about his departure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Meanwhile... PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : And also there's no sign that Maduro's interested in a discussion about his departure, I should add. I mean, Maduro is standing firm when it comes to the issue of his departure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Meanwhile, the U.S., the Trump administration, has cut off Maduro's revenues from oil and is exerting a lot of influence in Venezuela in hopes of pushing Maduro out of power. How is that being received? I mean, what do Venezuelans on the street, the protesters, make of the U.S. involvement? PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : Well, I think the protesters appreciate it, but I think a lot of people are also very worried. It's very hard to see how we can avoid a very violent situation evolving here. Let's say, best-case scenario, that Maduro goes, but what happens then? Will the police and the national guard just show up for work the next day, saying that, you know, the Venezuelan socialist experiment's over, we work for someone else now? PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : There's a very high risk there'll be a vacuum for a while while these security forces figure out who's in charge and while the strongly pro-Maduro elements disappear. And, remember; this country's got a population that's very hungry and very poor, mightily abused and angry. I don't see how you could avoid a situation where, in those circumstances, there will be mass looting. And that's in the opposition's best-case scenario. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Thanks so much... PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE : It could get much worse than that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. Thanks so much, Phil. NPR's Phil Reeves in Caracas for us. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK. Back in this country, Democratic presidential hopefuls are already staking out their positions on critical issues, including health care. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in a CNN town hall meeting earlier this week and supported Medicare for all. KAMALA HARRIS : It is inhumane to make people go through a system where they cannot literally receive the benefit of what medical science can offer. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Yeah, in the town hall, she supported not only government insurance for everybody but also eliminating the private insurance industry. Who needs it, she effectively said. Afterward, her campaign walked that back, saying that she would be open to more modest reforms, which suggests just how politically tricky health care remains. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right.

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Apple has reported that iPhone sales fell 15 percent in the last three months of 2018. And while this bad news was not entirely unexpected, it does mark a new low point for the tech company, whose iPhones, obviously, revolutionized the mobile phone industry. Joining me now to talk about what all this means for the company - NPR's Laura Sydell. Good morning, Laura. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : Good morning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What's going on with Apple? I mean, it was just last year that the company became the first American public company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation, right? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : I know. It's amazing. But since the fall, the company has lost about a third of its value. And there are a few factors that are playing into what got us to this moment. There is China, which, along with Taiwan, analysts say, brings in close to 20 percent of Apple's business. And the Chinese economy's slowing, so customers there are buying fewer iPhones. In fact, many Chinese are turning to cheaper smartphones made by native companies like Huawei and iPhone knockoffs. In an earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook also pointed out that the dollar has been really strong. And that's raised the price for the phone outside of the U.S. And I will say it's not just China. People in the U.S. and other developed countries are also buying fewer new iPhones. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Well, why's that happening in the U.S.? I mean, the U.S. economy's doing pretty well, right? People still aren't buying iPhones then. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : No. In the earnings call yesterday, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, blamed a couple of factors for that. One is that the phone carriers, like AT&T and Verizon and so forth, have actually stopped subsidizing new phones. And this has been happening slowly over the past few years. So now when you go and buy a phone, the price of the phone service has gone down but you actually have to pay for your own new phone. And a new iPhone can cost you, like, a thousand bucks, right? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : So there are a lot of people who are just holding onto their phones longer. Cook also said the company's decision to replace iPhone batteries at a cheaper price means a lot of people have just decided to hang onto the phone they have. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : OK. So I want to go back to something you said earlier. You mentioned the company Huawei. And there will be people in our audience who recognize that name because that's the name of the Chinese telecom that the U.S. Treasury has sanctioned - right? - for intellectual property violations. Is... LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : Absolutely. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : How does this connect to decreasing iPhone sales? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : You know, it doesn't directly connect other than today, there are high-level Chinese officials coming to Washington for trade talks with the Trump administration. And since Apple would prefer we had better relationships with China... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : ...Of course, it might not bode well for the talks because the Chinese might be in a bad mood. I will say, though, the other thing is it isn't just Apple. There are other companies who are feeling the slowdown. Nvidia already - its quarterly outlook said their sales were slowing because of China. Also, Caterpillar, the industrial equipment maker, also ran into that. So there's a lot riding on China. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Meanwhile, on top of all the bad news for Apple about the iPhone sales, the company got bad publicity this week because a 14-year-old discovered a security breach. What can you tell us? LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : Yes, he was playing a game. And he's - he was a 14-year-old in Arizona. And he discovered that when he called a friend using FaceTime, which is Apple's video conference call, he could eavesdrop on his friend before his friend actually picked up the call. His mother spent more than a week trying to bring the problem to Apple's attention before Apple finally acknowledged it and began working to fix it. Researchers say it should not have taken that long. And Apple has banked a lot on security and privacy, saying, we're the company for security and privacy. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : And then this happens. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : It doesn't bode well for them. LAURA SYDELL, BYLINE : No, it doesn't look good. \n\n ###",

The U.S. Treasury announced new sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil exports. U.S. refineries say they will no longer send cash to Venezuela in exchange for crude oil. Here's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. STEVEN MNUCHIN : The United States is holding accountable those responsible for Venezuela's tragic decline. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And in a complicated scenario, the United States says it is happy to keep receiving Venezuelan oil but wants to avoid directly paying for it. How's that going to work? Well, NPR's Camila Domonoske is here to try to explain. Good morning. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So what is the basic theory of the U.S. approach of targeting Venezuela's oil at all? CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : So Venezuela's heavily reliant on its oil exports. And it's specifically heavily dependent on sales to the United States because the U.S. is one of the few remaining sources of cash for the Venezuelan government. And Venezuela's economy is in free fall. It's been collapsing for several years, and the country has massive shortages of food, medicine, electricity, pretty much everything. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Socialist government management hasn't gone really well. Things have gradually gotten worse, and then you have political chaos as protests have mounted against that government. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : Right. So Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is increasingly unpopular. He declared victory in a re-election. The election was disputed. And now the opposition leader Juan Guaido has also declared himself president, so, like you said, political chaos. And the United States has a firm position on this. The U.S. has backed Guaido against Maduro. So these sanctions are designed to put as much pressure as possible on Maduro's government in order to attempt to get him out of office. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK, so how do the sanctions work? CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : So the sanctions say that U.S. refineries cannot send money in exchange for oil that they receive from PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. They can still take that oil in if Venezuela's willing to keep sending it, but the billions of dollars of payment that would be put out will go into blocked accounts in the U.S. instead of going to Venezuela. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, it'd be like - they'd be impounded. They'd be frozen assets that might be going to Venezuela at sometime later or maybe end up with the opposition government at some point. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : Exactly. The Treasury Department says if there's a new government in Venezuela, that government will get access to these blocked accounts. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Why would the U.S. specifically say, Venezuela, it's fine for us to send the oil anyway? CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : So the reason to leave this channel open, the possibility of receiving this crude oil, the Trump administration wants to push Maduro out of office. But they don't necessarily want to totally disrupt the oil industry. For one thing, U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast have been buying this oil. And it would be really disruptive for them to not have any access to it at all. It could also affect world oil markets. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Wait a minute. So the United States needs the oil that it doesn't want to pay for? CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : We have been taking that oil in and processing it. Whether we need it is a little bit of a point in dispute. Venezuela's oil production has already dropped significantly over the last several years. So refineries that used to be pretty dependent on this crude oil are less dependent on it now than they used to be. But that said, it is a significant factor in some refineries on the coast. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Any particular reason the Maduro government would allow the oil to continue being sent even though they would not be receiving payment anytime soon, if ever? CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : So like I said, Venezuela's really reliant on cash money from the U.S. And one reason is because there aren't a lot of people around the world who are buying Venezuelan oil and paying money for it. Russia and China are taking oil in, but they aren't paying for it either. They're accepting it as debt payment, so it is possible. We'll have to see if that money is still a motivating factor for Venezuela if it's temporarily frozen. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Camila, thanks for the update - really appreciate it. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE : Yeah, thank you. \n\n ###",

Did you see many people out in the elements? DEBRA GONZALEZ : We actually did not, luckily. There's many of us groups out here picking up people. And I think a lot of them stayed in the warming shelters that we had seen Tuesday night. Some of our shelters were able to stay open during the day yesterday. So - and, actually, yesterday, I was out from 8 in the morning until 8 in the evening, having been previously out Tuesday night until Wednesday morning - 12:30. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Wow.

And there now appears to be a framework for making that happen. But the Afghan central government hasn't been directly involved in these discussions. So far, the negotiations have been between the U.S. and the Taliban, which has left many Afghans worried about their future. Roya Rahmani is not one of them, though. She was recently appointed Afghanistan's first female ambassador to the U.S. And she is optimistic the U.S. will do right by her country. What is less clear to her is whether the Taliban is negotiating in good faith. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Do you trust the Taliban negotiators? ROYA RAHMANI : I haven't been at the table to be able to directly respond to this. However, what I could say is that our people has demonstrated the generosity to let go of the past and to let go of the grievances as a price for peace. And they are willing to come in terms. There is one other thing also - that Afghanistan is a changed place. The resolve to democracy is one of our highest values. I will quickly share with you something that really moved me when I visited Afghanistan after parliamentary election, and that was that a taxi driver sacrificed seven hours of his income earning hours while he is responsible for feeding four of his children at home in order to cast his vote. That shows there is resolve to democracy - our resolve to the values that we have earned. And Afghanistan's nation, a changed nation now, has different standing and aspiration today. So whatever the outcome, it has to cater to that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What happens to Afghanistan's young democracy if the Taliban is either incorporated into a power-sharing agreement or, at the very least, legitimized through this peace plan? ROYA RAHMANI : The Taliban, if part of the Afghan society, they can certainly participate in the democratic processes. We have laid out a very clear roadmap towards peace on how we could go about this. And we are hoping to be able to unroll that. That will specify the rules, and they are most welcome to join and be part of the power sharing, stand for election, have people vote for them. This is their right like every other Afghan citizens' right. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You are the first woman to serve as ambassador from Afghanistan to the United States. Are you concerned that if the Taliban is incorporated into government, if the Taliban is legitimized, that all those advances for minorities in Afghanistan - for women in particular - are you concerned that they will be reversed? ROYA RAHMANI : Rachel, I don't believe that Afghanistan could fall back. We are a changed nation. There is a shift in the mindset. Let me give you an example. I have met a soldier who has joined our forces simply because he has two daughters. And he will not agree that his daughters will not go to school. That's the reason he told me he joined our forces. Afghanistan is a changed place, and this is why that there is more to a peaceful Afghanistan to offer to all its partners as a partner - not as a dependent - in the foreseeable future. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : At some point if the peace talks continue, you as an ambassador, I would imagine, would have occasion to be in a meeting with a Taliban leader. Would they even tolerate your presence there considering their subjugation of women? I mean, it's one thing for you to say you believe that Afghanistan is moving forward, but the Taliban have not conceded that at all. They still maintain the same views about women's place in society. ROYA RAHMANI : Well, that question is for them to answer. But at the same time, let's not forget if I am at the table like many other women, I will be representing half of my population. If - no deal would be acceptable if it ignores half of our population. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Ambassador Roya Rahmani, thank you so much for talking with us. ROYA RAHMANI : Thank you very much. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : She is Afghanistan's ambassador to the U.S., the first woman to serve in that role. NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman was listening in to that conversation and joins me now. Good morning, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Hey. Good morning, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : So Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad is the special envoy leading the U.S. in these peace talks. He insists - Khalilzad does - that nothing is for sure until the Afghan central government signs off on it. But how likely is that? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, right, that's what he said. It's important to note, Rachel, we're in the very early stages of this process. The Taliban have yet to agree even to sit down with the Afghan government. That's what really has to happen. And that's what the Afghan government is demanding, and so is the U.S. government. Now, the Taliban say before they sit down with the Afghan government, they want a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Meanwhile, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says the rights of the Afghan people will not be compromised in the name of peace. So that clearly means making sure the rights of women are assured, that women can work outside the home, girls can go to school and so forth. But again, we're sort of at a stalemate a little bit here, you know, because the Taliban want that timetable withdrawal of U.S. troops before they sit down with the Afghan government. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right, and... TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Again, there's a lot that has to be done here. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I mean, we heard a lot of optimism in the ambassador's voice there. But what is to prevent the Taliban from overthrowing the Afghan government once the U.S. is gone? TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE : Well, that's of great concern of people within the Afghan government who just don't trust the Taliban and are wary of any deal and, of course, are concerned that the U.S. will leave abruptly. President Trump has said he'll pull about 7,000 troops out. That's half the number there now. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : This week, newly empowered Democrats are asking why President Trump sent U.S. troops to the border with Mexico. The question comes from the House Armed Services Committee. New Chairman Adam Smith says he will use his power to question the president's use of the military. ADAM SMITH : If you ask the military anything, do you know what the answer is? Yes. Can you take that hill? Can you win this war? They always say yes. That's why we have civilian control of the military. They need to have that attitude. We need to make the smart decisions to say, I appreciate the positive approach; I don't think you can, and I don't think it's in the best interests of the United States to spend your blood trying. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Adam Smith has represented Washington state for more than 20 years. We met in his Capitol office, where he's preparing for a hearing on Tuesday. He has questions about the president's chaotic decision-making. He says that even though he broadly agrees with some of the president's goals. For example, he favors the president's move to reduce the U.S. presence in Syria, just not doing it so suddenly in a tweet. ADAM SMITH : And that is the troubling thing, of course. The president - we won; it's over; ISIS is done; we can leave now. You know, I mean, where do you get that from? STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Well, has the president been right to push for a smaller U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan? ADAM SMITH : I believe so. Yes. And Afghanistan's a real big problem. I really wish that the United States did not have national security interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our interest in the region is the threat of transnational terrorist groups, obviously. That's where bin Laden was hanging out when he hit us on 9/11. We want to make sure they don't rise again. But the perpetual notion that if we just put in another 5,000 troops, if we just stay another five years, then we'll have a stable enough government in Kabul that we'll have an ally - yeah. We are losing lives and spending money in Afghanistan, and I'm not sure we're making progress. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Just go. You're open to that, you said. ADAM SMITH : Well, not just go - there's no way to just go. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : But... ADAM SMITH : OK. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : ...Get going in whatever fashion... ADAM SMITH : Yes. Do it... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : ...You can. ADAM SMITH : Yeah. It takes time - probably years, not months - in order to pull people out in a responsible way. But a strategy that says our continued military presence in Afghanistan is unlikely to improve the situation, is unlikely to be worth the cost, is an argument that is becoming more and more persuasive to me. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Do you intend to use the power that you have as the head of this committee to push for that outcome? ADAM SMITH : I intend to use the power that I have on this committee to spur that debate. And the only way out of this is through a negotiated settlement. And there will not be peace in Afghanistan, probably in my lifetime. There are so many factions and so many warlords. What you want is you want to try to reduce them. And the way to do that - make peace with the Taliban. You know, build some sort of coalition government. Believe me; there are costs to that. I understand that. You know, and then, hopefully, yes; use that group to fight off, you know, ISIS and others. But the Taliban blows hot and cold on that, you know, depending on the day, and I don't know. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : When President Trump ordered troops to the border to help secure the border against a caravan that - been in the news shortly before the midterm election, was that a legitimate use of U.S. military power? ADAM SMITH : Absolutely not. And the active-duty troops, I think they, like, put up some barbed wire and maybe built a temporary structure or two, and you can't tell me that was a good use of their time. Border security has gotten a ton better in the last 14 years, in part because we've made a lot of policy decisions to do it. But the president is manufacturing a crisis to pander to his base and try to keep a - well, and obviously, he's not trying to keep his campaign promise because his campaign promise was that Mexico was going to pay for it. But he made that promise because it played well with the crowd. Something that plays well to the crowd doesn't translate into policy. Now, to the extent we have a - these caravans that are coming - they're turning themselves in. OK? You don't need a wall. You know, you don't need anything (ph) to stop them. We need stuff to process them. The only thing that has really changed is we could use some more money for judges to process asylum-seekers. You know, processing asylum-seekers is the crisis, and the president is demagoguing this issue instead of addressing the problems that he raises. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : If the deployment to the border right before the election was not a legitimate use of military power, what was it? Was that a political use of the military? ADAM SMITH : Absolutely. I mean, the president was trying - this crisis - they're coming for us. You heard his language. You know, we have an invasion, you know, coming at us, which was utter and complete nonsense. But when you engage the active-duty military, that drives up the debate because that's what we use - and the military is stopping an invasion. Well, the military didn't stop anything. Most of those people who went down to the border were sitting around playing cards because they didn't have anything to do because there was no invasion. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : The Supreme Court ruled this week that the Trump administration can, for now, enforce a ban on many transgender military personnel. The president announced that ban on Twitter in 2017. The Pentagon effort to refine his tweet into policy is being challenged in court. And the justices say the policy may go into effect while the court challenges proceed. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Army Staff Sergeant Patricia King is among those affected. She has served in the military for almost two decades, received much attention in recent years as a transgender woman in the years when President Obama's administration was allowing transgender personnel to serve. Before her transition, she was deployed to Afghanistan three times. PATRICIA KING : My second trip to Afghanistan was in 2003. And it was one of the most life-altering experiences for me. And the reason I say that is we had the opportunity, when we were there, to see the difference that had been made in the short time from our occupation to 2003. I saw women driving cars. I saw children going to school, and I saw the difference that we had the opportunity to make. And that sat with me. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : How did you identify at that time? PATRICIA KING : At the time, I had not come out, even to myself. So I still identified as a male. And I was wrestling with the feelings that I was having. I felt like I was stuck in the wrong body. But this was at the birth of Google. There was no Internet search history to find an understanding. There were very few books. So I didn't have an understanding of the feelings I was having. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : When did your thoughts clarify? PATRICIA KING : Towards the end of that decade, towards around 2010, I started to understand what it was. I understood that this is not something that's just going to go away. But I was married, happily so. And at that point in time, what I had decided was that I was going to repress these feelings. I had made the assumption that my family would not be accepting, that I couldn't just end one life and start another as a different person. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And you decided on a different course when? PATRICIA KING : Towards the end of my most recent deployment in 2014, my wife and I decided the best course for us was to dissolve our marriage. And in that moment, I had the opportunity to make a decision about what I wanted the rest of my life to look like. Through a lot of thought and a lot of prayer, I made the decision that I was going to come out and start a transition. And then it was time to come out at work. PATRICIA KING : Now, the Army was not yet at a point where we had changed our policy. So coming out at work was a risky thing. But I knew that being authentic to myself was important. So I came out to my leaders and my peers in the Army. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And then President Obama did change the policy for a while. Is that correct? PATRICIA KING : Yes, shortly after that there was an announcement that there would be a freeze on transgender discharges while they did a one-year study. In the end, the DOD rolled out a policy allowing us to serve openly and genuinely. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Now the rules have changed again. What do those rules mean for your day-to-day life as a soldier? PATRICIA KING : The policy that is going into place creates a grandfather clause for transgender service members, which essentially makes those of us who are serving openly right now kind of like the last white rhinos. This particular policy affects all of us. This decision and this policy give a false sense of credibility to the inaccurate notion that transgender people are somehow less or less capable than our peers. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : How have you answered the objection, which I'm sure you've heard from someone in the military, that they want you to be ready to serve and not going through surgeries? PATRICIA KING : Every service member will likely go through a period where they are not deployable for some small period of time, whether it be an injury, the birth of a child. We all go through that. Service members are not robots. We are people with lives. And human lives sometimes have factors that slow us down. PATRICIA KING : Transition can be that. But in my experience and in my case, the portion of time where I was not deployable and not ready to go to war was incredibly small. And every transgender service member knows that our first responsibility is to our job. PATRICIA KING : We employ the best and brightest in the military. And we appreciate what they bring to the table. Providing world-class care to the best and brightest is the cost of doing business to have the finest military and all-volunteer force in the world. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Staff Sergeant King, thanks so much for taking the time. PATRICIA KING : Thank you. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : In modern times, the speeches in the Senate debate draw limited attention. But Senator Michael Bennet was an exception yesterday. The Colorado Democrat is usually a pretty reserved guy. But yesterday, the Senate failed to advance two plans to end a partial government shutdown, and Bennet wasn't having it. MICHAEL BENNET : How ludicrous it is that this government is shut down over a promise the president of the United States couldn't keep and that America is not interested in having him keep. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Republicans for their port - for their part reportedly lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over the impasse at a private lunch. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : So what now? NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here. Tamara, good morning. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Have Senators come up with anything that maybe could pass? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Well, not necessarily... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : (Laughter) OK. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : But they're talking. And that's the thing. There were these two test votes yesterday, and they failed. But taking a test that fails has a purpose. And it really kickstarted conversations. I think part of why it kickstarted conversations is that six Senate Republicans crossed party lines and voted in favor of the Democratic bill to reopen the government and fund the government without funding a wall... STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Which is the big - the big dividing line here, the president's demand for funding for a wall on the Mexican border. OK. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Right. And so that prompted the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to go huddle and talk about what was possible. And then they didn't really come up with anything fully, but they're talking, which is a new development. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK. And I guess they've talked about possibly a temporary reopening of the government while they negotiate. Of course, Democrats have demanded, open the government first; we'll talk about the wall later. Republicans have largely - with the exceptions you mentioned - obeyed the president in the Senate and voted the way that he wants, only to - only to have reopening the government with wall funding. Would the president approve of some kind of temporary - temporary movement? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : It's not 100 percent clear. He was asked about it yesterday. He said, you know, McConnell and Schumer, they're working on something. Let's see what they come up with. But, you know, maybe - maybe he said, he might support it. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Let's listen. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : One of the ideas suggested is they open it - they pay a - sort of a pro-rated downpayment for the wall, which I think people will agree that you need. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : So Senator Schumer's spokesman put out a statement after that saying, Democrats are a hard no on the wall, pro-rated or otherwise. President Trump was asked, well, what if they come up with something that doesn't have wall funding in it? And the president was a little squishy on it and then said, you know, I've got other options too. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, which would be a reference, I suppose, to the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, which is something the White House has discussed but dismissed up to now. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Exactly. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : The idea of a down payment on the wall would go against the Democratic position here. They've said they don't want to continuously have the president threatening to shut the government down to get things that he wants. Giving him a little bit of what he wants for a temporary reopening of the government would go against that position, wouldn't it? \n\n ###",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Do you have any insight as to what the president is thinking now beyond what he has said in public? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : Well, he has - he had this meeting with conservatives earlier this week. They came away thinking that he was going to hold firm and that he wasn't going to fold.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE : You're welcome. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : NPR's Tamara Keith. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Now, today federal workers miss their second paycheck. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Right, and crucial programs to help Americans pay rent or buy food are actually running out of money at this point. On TV yesterday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he was baffled by this. He said it should be simple for federal workers to take out loans. Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told NPR's Brockton Booker - Brakkton Booker, rather, that's not so simple. BEN CARSON : I mean, yes, I know we're going to give them back pay. But that doesn't take care of the interest if they borrow money. It doesn't make them whole again. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : And NPR's Brakkton Booker is in our studios. Brakkton, good morning. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE : Good morning. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Where did you run into Ben Carson? BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE : So we were at an event in D.C. It was a late-night event. We were actually - he was out there talking with members of the homeless population. He was getting basic information about their health and about their general circumstances, about how they became homeless. And we were chatting in between these interviews that he was conducting. And Carson is typically low-key, doesn't get riled up about things. But you could tell he was getting very frustrated about how long the shutdown had lasted. And here's what he had to say. BEN CARSON : We can continue to hope that our leaders will recognize that this is an easy problem to solve. Just take your ego out of it. BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE : So there, you hear him say, our leaders and, take your ego out of it. So, you know, at first glance I was like, well, does he mean Nancy Pelosi? Does he mean Senator Mitch McConnell? And does - does he mean President Trump? And I - I checked with the staff, and they insist that he was only talking about congressional leaders. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Oh, OK, although when you think about ego, there is a person who comes to mind. What are the secretary's concerns as this shutdown goes on? What makes it so bothersome to him? BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE : Well, he's certainly got the federal workforce on his mind, including many of his staff at HUD, who are, again, missing their second paychecks today. There is another concern, though, that obviously HUD provides rental assistance to many millions of low-income Americans. So his real concern, too, are evictions. Now, Carson pointed out that, you know, no tenant has ever been evicted as a result of a shutdown. But then again, no shutdown has ever lasted this long. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : OK, are there safety - safety net programs here that are going to run out if this goes, like, another month or so? BRAKKTON BOOKER, BYLINE : Well, it looks like a lot of programs, including housing choice voucher programs and project-based programs that HUD organizes, there are - there's food stamps, SNAP benefits that is run out of USDA. Most of these programs are going - it appears to be they're going to be running out of money by mid-February, certainly by early March. And that is giving a lot of concern to a lot of Americans. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : You know, I'm thinking if you're a tenant, it's going to be stressful not to be able to pay your rent and embarrassing not to be able to pay your rent. But you probably won't be evicted right away. The person who really ends up short there is the landlord. \n\n ###",

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : That's NPR's Brakkton Booker. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Some other news now. How is a crisis in Venezuela evolving? RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Some but not all Americans are moving out of harm's way. The State Department ordered non-emergency U.S. government employees to leave Venezuela. But key personnel remain in defiance of an order from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. says it's not going to follow the president's demand to evacuate because the U.S. recognizes not President Maduro, but instead, the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, as his replacement. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : Reporter John Otis has been following the situation closely. He joins us now. Hi there, John. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Hey, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST : How is each rival president moving to consolidate power? JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Well, it's a pretty bizarre situation. Maduro claims, you know, that he is the legitimate president because he took power through an election that was held last year. But that election, most international observers say it was a sham, that he basically stole the election. Nonetheless, he was sworn in for another six-year term just this month. And that's kind of what set off all these protests. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : Juan Guaido is Venezuela's - the head of the congress. And under the constitution, if there's a vancancy in the presidency, you know, the head of congress takes over. And that's his claim to legitimacy. He wants to lead a transitional government and hold new elections. And he's been recognized by the U.S. and most Latin American countries. JOHN OTIS, BYLINE : But for now, Maduro would seem to have the upper hand because he pounced on the backing of Venezuela's powerful military. So, you know, it's kind of a situation where Maduro has lots of power but not much legitimacy. And Guaido has a lot of legitimacy but no real power.

Earlier this month, a truck bomb targeted Shia Muslims in Baghdad, killing some 300 people. ISIS considers them apostates. In Bangladesh, radicals have gone after Muslims they suspect of blasphemy. NPR's Tom Gjelten reports on how a liberal Muslim in Saudi Arabia found himself facing such charges. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Eleven years ago in Saudi Arabia, a restless young man named Raif Badawi set up an internet forum. It was a place where he and other Saudis could share thoughts about the social order in their country. In English, the site was called Free Saudi Liberals. Inevitably, it got Badawi in trouble with the religious authorities. Four years ago, he was arrested. He remains in a Saudi prison today. ENSAF HAIDAR : (Foreign language spoken). TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Ensaf Haidar is Badawi's wife. She speaks here through an interpreter. ENSAF HAIDAR : (Through interpreter) As it is written in the judgment, he has been accused of creating an internet website, adopting liberal thinking and ridiculing some religious figures as well. And he also liked a Christian page. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : That was on Facebook. Haidar fled Saudi with their three children and now lives in Canada. In her book, \"Raif Badawi: The Voice Of Freedom,\" Haidar says that her husband is a good Muslim but that he promoted a live-and-let-live philosophy. That's a perspective conservative Saudi clerics consider un-Islamic. ENSAF HAIDAR : (Through interpreter) There was a fatwa issued against him from 150 religious figures in Saudi Arabia. So this was the main thing that created the problem for him. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : A serious problem. In a Saudi court, Badawi was charged with blasphemy and apostasy. For conservative Muslims, blasphemy is when someone insults Islam or the Prophet Muhammad. Apostasy is when a Muslim rejects Islam altogether. Badawi was accused of abandoning his faith for liberalism. Assim Al-Hakeem is a hard-line Saudi sheikh famous for lecturing in English. ASSIM AL-HAKEEM : The consensus of all scholars that if a person changes his religion from Islam to any other religion, the punishment should be execution, death. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Badawi was indeed condemned. Under international pressure, Saudi authorities later reduced his death sentence to 10 years in prison and a thousand lashes. But his case raises vital questions. Who gets to judge what constitutes blasphemy or apostasy? And is this what Islam really teaches? Sheikh Assim, while defending the death sentence for apostates, says in one of his online lectures that it can be imposed only by the government of an Islamic state on the advice of scholars. ASSIM AL-HAKEEM : It is not for Tom, Dick or Harry to carry out this punishment. This cannot be done without following the procedure, meaning if someone says that he doesn't believe in the Prophet (speaking Arabic), can we go and chop his head off? The answer is no. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Sheikh Assim says ISIS leaders do not follow the required procedure, so their killings are not justified. He defends the Saudi approach. But in her book, Ensaf Haidar says that system often amounts to vigilante justice. ENSAF HAIDAR : (Through interpreter) In terms of who can accuse a person of apostasy, unfortunately, it's anybody who has a long beard. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : The men with long beards are the ones with influence. The version of Islam prevailing in Saudi Arabia is Wahhabism, an uncompromising fundamentalist ideology dating from the 18th century. Akbar Ahmed, chairman of Islamic Studies at American University in Washington, says Raif Badawi's live-and-let-live philosophy doesn't fit with Wahhabism. AKBAR AHMED : The Wahhabi faith would take a very conservative, very hard line of drawing boundaries around the faith and saying, in fact, you cannot have a live-and-let-live philosophy. It must be only this way of life. Anything else is not the correct interpretation of how we approach God. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : But many Muslim scholars question whether Wahhabism is a true reflection of Islam. Akbar Ahmed says some of what's associated with it and other fundamentalist interpretations of Islam does not actually come from the Quran or from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, but rather reflects beliefs and practices passed down from Arab tribes before Islam even emerged as a religion. AKBAR AHMED : Very often, pre-Islamic customs come into Islam, for example, honor killings. These are tribal customs which have come into Islam. So tribes which are Muslim will practice these in their societies. And they will say these are Muslim because we are Muslim. In fact, these are not Islamic, and they come from outside Islam. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : Another consideration, seventh-century Arabia was a purely Islamic state. To be a Muslim was to be a citizen. To reject Islam was to reject state authority. Apostasy was tantamount to treason. But that was a political, not a theological, fact. And Akbar Ahmed of American University says such anti-democratic thinking has no place in the modern world. AKBAR AHMED : When someone tells me there's no democracy in Islam, I ask them, which Islam are you talking about? Because it's certainly not my understanding of Islam. To me, the value of Islam is precisely that it is a religion which is compassionate, which is inclusive and can be interpreted in a way that people who are not Muslim are able to relate to it and be comfortable with it. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE : This is, however, what Ahmed calls a modernist view of Islam. And he acknowledges that it's the ultra-conservative fundamentalists who have been gaining strength recently in the Muslim world, from Saudi Arabia to Syria to South Asia. That does not bode well for liberals like Raif Badawi, who still faces years in a Saudi prison. Tom Gjelten, NPR News. \n\n ###",

MADELEINE BRAND, host : I am Madeleine Brand. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Coming up, the cost of food is going up, so restaurant chefs get creative in the kitchen. ALEX CHADWICK, host : First, gay marriage in California. Eight years ago, voters in the state past a referendum that says marriage is for a man and a woman only. Gay and lesbian couples are trying to get that reversed, the California Supreme Court is supposed to rule on it today. Right now, Massachusetts is the only state where gay marriage is completely legal. Sarah Varney is a reporter for KQED. Sarah, what are the cases before the court today? What are they arguing? Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : There is about two dozen gay and lesbian couples who have joined with the city of San Francisco, and they've argued that the state ban on same-sex marriage discriminates based on gender or sexual orientation, and that it violates their fundamental right to marry. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So there is just a basic constitutional question before the court. You mentioned that San Francisco is a party to this, and remind us, a few years ago there was kind of a brief spade of same-sex marriages in the city. What happened? Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : Back in 2004, San Francisco Mayor, Gavin Newsom, said that the state ban against same-sex marriage, in his mind, violated the state constitution. And so on Valentine's Day, four years ago, he opened up City Hall and allowed gay couples to get married. So I was there that whole weekend, it went on for quite a few days, and there were couples lined up around the block. In the end, about four thousand couples got married. The Supreme Court came in quickly after that, and put a stop to it, and then, during the court proceedings, they overturned all of those marriages, essentially saying that the Mayor didn't have the authority to make that decision. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So the case that's before the Supreme Court, now, began sort of back then. And what are experts predicting that the court is going to say today, if indeed there can be any predictions? Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : It is very difficult to say, I was at oral arguments several months ago, and the court seems very split, I think, whichever way the court goes it will be a very close decision. It did seem that the Chief Justice, Ron George, who is a Republican, this is a Republican majority court, did seem inclined to agree with the same-sex couples, that the state of California has long recognized the rights of same-sex couples, to raise children, to be foster parents, to own property. And perhaps it no longer makes sense to bar them from marriage. So there is a lot of discussion in this, during oral arguments on why should the state of California continue to maintain essentially separate institutions for gay men and lesbians, and for heterosexuals. The court was really curious about, what is this about marriage that really matters. And there is a lot of discussion back and forth, that marriage communicates a deep meaning, that the name marriage matters. Some of the justices said, doesn't having separate institutions remind us of bans on interracial marriage? They talked a lot about a case in 1948, California was the first state in the country to overturn a ban on interracial marriage. There is lot of conversation about whether or not those same principles apply to this case. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Is this situation any different because the court is dealing here with a referendum that was passed by the state's voters, or does that just simply not matter because is a basic constitutional question? Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : Essentially, it doesn't matter. It is a basic constitutional question, the court seems inclined to - they weren't going to say let's kick this back to the voters, for instance, and let them have another try at it. I would add, though, there is the 2000 Prop 22, which is what you were referring to, but there is also a state statute that goes back to, I believe, it is the late 70s. It is in the State Family Code that also defines marriage as that between a man and a woman. So it is actually two different things that they are looking at here. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Now the state legislature has, in the ensuing years, twice passed laws legalizing same-sex marriages. Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : That's right. ALEX CHADWICK, host : And Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed both of those. Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : That's correct. Governor Schwarzenegger said the voters have spoken on this in 2000, when they passed Proposition 22, so I'm going to leave it up to the voters, or whatever the court decides, I will follow what the court decides. ALEX CHADWICK, host : So that decision is coming down later today. I read a coMm: ent from a gay activist who said, whatever way California goes, this is going to be a very important decision for the entire country. Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : I think so. I mean, everybody has been watching, obviously California is the most populous state in the country, has a very large gay and lesbian population. If the court does rule to overturn the ban, that would take effect in about 30 days, unless the court says otherwise. And so within 30 days, if in fact this ban on same-sex marriages is overturned, you'd start to see gay couples getting married in California. ALEX CHADWICK, host : Sarah Varney of KQED, in San Francisco. Sarah, thank you. Ms. SARAH VARNEY (Reporter for KQED) : Thank you.

We're talking working-class white men, especially union members, the Reagan Democrats of the 1980s. This week, NPR and several member stations are taking a look at battleground communities as part of our project A Nation Engaged. Today, NPR's Don Gonyea has this report from the Detroit suburbs in a state the Democrats expect to win. But with these voters, it's clear Hillary Clinton still has work to do. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : If you stop by Larry McCool's house in Garden City, you'll be greeted by a trio of giant Rottweiler dogs. Don't worry, they're friendly, he tells me. LARRY MCCOOL : Come here. Come on, Coco. LARRY MCCOOL : Maxie's about 12. Azul, he's about 2. And they're both rescues. LARRY MCCOOL : Come here, Az (ph). Az, come here. Good boy. Smile. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : Coco, who looks like a small bear, seems to be angling to play fetch with my microphone in the backyard. McCool is 54, a union carpenter. LARRY MCCOOL : My neighbor on one side, he's a UAW worker. The neighbor over here's a Teamster. You know, so it's basically auto industry and basically good union people. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : When the financial crisis hit here, these small single-family homes took a big hit, he says, losing more than half their value just like that. LARRY MCCOOL : Everybody was upside down. I mean, it was terrible 'cause to go to work and see somebody's stuff sitting on their front lawn - and I remember one of the first ones I've seen. And I stopped on the side of the road. And the wind was blowing stuff around, and I asked the woman if she needed help. You know, she was being evicted, and you could tell all hope was lost. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : He says the area's coming back, but slowly. McCool is voting for Hillary Clinton after being a Bernie Sanders supporter in the primaries. He says Trump is all ego. LARRY MCCOOL : You know, you're Caesar - you know, here comes Caesar and boom, boom, boom (ph). You know, he's got his whole family with him and we're going to do this. And, I mean, we're not the Roman Empire where we're going to walk in and take things. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : McCool's support of Clinton puts him in line with his union and with the national AFL-CIO. But it's not hard to find dissenting opinions among the rank and file here. JIM BELL : I'm - I - none of them. That's who I like. I don't like any of them. They're a joke. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : Forty-four-year-old Jim Bell works in nearby Dearborn. He's a Ford employee represented by the United Auto Workers Union. Politically, he says he's an independent. JIM BELL : I'm undecided. However, I lean more towards Trump just because I think the change that Obama wanted to bring - I think Trump will. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : Bell does like what the billionaire candidate says about trade, including that American factories will come roaring back, that auto jobs will return from Mexico. But Trump has also said UAW members make too much money. Bell doesn't like that, nor does he like that so many Trump-branded products, like Trump ties and shirts, are manufactured overseas. JIM BELL : Make America great again, but he's contradicting exactly his theme song for this campaign by buying everything over in China. You know, and it's - however, that is still better than shady Hillary. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : Bell's coworker, Kevin Eisbrenner, has been a Trump backer from the beginning. Both he and Bell say they do wish Trump would tone down the insults, but they like that he's not politically correct. Eisbrenner also said this about Trump. KEVIN EISBRENNER : I'm voting for the man, but do I think he's qualified as a politician? No. But what he's qualified at - he's a leader. And every good leader knows how to surround themselves with qualified people. DON GONYEA, BYLINE : Now to a coffee shop in Novi in northwest suburban Detroit. Fifty-five-year-old Scott Klein is a long-haul truck driver and former Sanders supporter. He is also undecided now, but he does not like Trump, which sets him apart from most of the other drivers he talks to. \n\n ###",

MADELEINE BRAND, host : I am Madeleine Brand. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Food prices are likely to remain high for the next two to three years, that announcement came today, from the UN.

ALEX COHEN : At Lucille's Smokehouse Barbecue, in Torrance, California, that bell means it is time to open the smoker. Mr. CRAIG HOFFMAN (Owner, Lucille's Smokehouse Barbecue) : True barbecue is low and slow smoking and cooking of the barbecued meats. ALEX COHEN : Craig Hoffman, the restaurant's owner, proudly shows off his smoker, which can hold up to a thousand pounds of meat. Inside are rotating racks of tri-tip, chicken legs, baby back ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. Mr. CRAIG HOFFMAN (Owner, Lucille's Smokehouse Barbecue) : All those items are based upon feed cost, and with sixty percent of the corn crop either going to ethanol or being exported, our product costs have gone up. ALEX COHEN : Hoffman's customers are also being hit by the high cost of food and gas, so they aren't eating out as much. Mr. CRAIG HOFFMAN (Owner, Lucille's Smokehouse Barbecue) : We are seeing less and less of our customers coming in as regularly as they used to. ALEX COHEN : Hoffman didn't want to raise prices, so he's made changes in what you get for the existing prices. For example, he used to offer two side dishes with every lunch order. Mr. CRAIG HOFFMAN (Owner, Lucille's Smokehouse Barbecue) : So you can get French fries and corn, or potato salad and beans, then we've now gone down to one side. ALEX COHEN : Across the country, from the local diner to fine dining establishments, restaurant owners are changing the way they do business. Mr. HOWARD GORDON (The Cheesecake Factory) : We revamped our lunch menu. ALEX COHEN : The Cheesecake Factory's Howard Gordon says even though the nationwide chain is known for its enormous servings, they've decided to reduce portion sizes on some items. Mr. HOWARD GORDON (The Cheesecake Factory) : We were hearing from our guests that for a lunch they didn't want to take leftovers back to work to put into a refrigerator, while at dinner they were more than happy to take home everything that was left over. ALEX COHEN : Other chains are switching ingredients. Chuck E. Cheese, that prince of pizza, is now using a cheaper cheese, a reformulated mozzarella product. At Legal Sea Foods, a popular East Coast chain, beverage VP, Sandy Block, says while the dollar is weak in Europe, and domestic wine prices are up, they are buying more bottles from South America. Mr. SANDY BLOCK (Beverage VP, Legal Sea Foods) : Something would have been unthinkable maybe even three to five years ago, but we are planning a new list with substantially more Argentinean Malbac than California Merlot. ALEX COHEN : But changing wine lists, menus, and ingredients can easily turn off customers, which is why many restaurateurs turn to guys like Ron Paul.

We're looking at how the current economic downturn is affecting people and their communities.  Today a valuable commodity in the Upper Midwest is draining away.  Wisconsin, Nebraska, the Dakotas, they're all losing young workers.  As the 20- somethings pack up and leave, so do hopes for an economic recovery.  Celeste Headlee reports. CELESTE HEADLEE : This is the sound of college kids, doing what college kids do, on a spring day on the campus of Wayne State University in Detroit.  They may not even be aware of it, but what they do after they finish school will have a major impact on the economic fortunes of the entire Midwest.  You see, businesses tend to locate in places where there's an educated, energetic workforce, and many of these students aren't sticking around after graduation. Professor DAVID SWENSON (Economics, Iowa State University) : People go to where they think they're going to get work.  Jobs go to where they think they're going to find the right kind of people. CELESTE HEADLEE : That's economist Dave Swenson of Iowa State University. Professor DAVID SWENSON (Economics, Iowa State University) : Where those two things intersect currently just isn't in the Midwest and the Plains. CELESTE HEADLEE : So, people are heading west, east, and south in search of a better lifestyle, and Carolyn Sallee with the Anderson Economic Group in Michigan says it's no surprise. Ms. CAROLYN SALLEE (Consultant, Anderson Economic Group) : Manufacturing jobs falling by 30 percent, and so those are the good paying blue-collar jobs that you needed a high school education, and you could go and you could make a 60,000 dollar salary. Mr. JOHN TILLMAN (Chairman, CEO, Illinois Policy Institute) : Moving statistics from moving companies really tells the tale of whether states are having in-migration or out-migration, and the Midwest and Illinois, for example, is suffering from out-migration at a very large rate. CELESTE HEADLEE : That's John Tillman with the Illinois Policy Institute.  He says his home state has lost over 700,000 people in the last decade. Mr. JOHN TILLMAN (Chairman, CEO, Illinois Policy Institute) : You can certainly see it in places in Cook County outside of Chicago.  Some of the neighborhoods that have struggled.  You can see it in certain parts of this city where they'll be blocks and blocks of boarded up places where people have left. CELESTE HEADLEE : And Dave Swenson from Iowa State says it goes beyond urban areas and manufacturing jobs. Professor DAVID SWENSON (Economics, Iowa State University) : The Dakotas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, all are losing population in their non-metropolitan areas. CELESTE HEADLEE : In fact, Swenson says 75 percent of counties in those states have seen declines, and it's not that state governments aren't aware of the problem. Professor DAVID SWENSON (Economics, Iowa State University) : Every state in the Midwest has been doing everything they can think of to stimulate growth, to try to entice, bribe, or otherwise subsidize economic development.  Whatever it takes to remain competitive, they've tried it. CELESTE HEADLEE : Carolyn Sallee says Midwestern states know they have to let go of the old industrial economy, and start adapting to modern realities. Ms. CAROLYN SALLEE (Consultant, Anderson Economic Group) : So, in the auto industry maybe not making cars, but doing other research and development for it.  Or it's taking the agricultural products and then, you know, thinking about how they can be used, and turned into fuel. CELESTE HEADLEE : And it's slow, probably too slow to stem the current exodus of 20- somethings, but Susan Ramsey of the Greater Des Moines Partnership says her city has focused on those recent graduates and two-income couples.  Yes, the city is diversifying, but it's also about doing the little things. Ms. SUSAN RAMSEY (Senior Vice President, Greater Des Moines Partnership) : We've learned from a lot of our employers that they were having trouble landing interns because what they were going to pay interns for the summer, wouldn't necessarily support them in renting an apartment for the summer. \n\n ###",

This is the first international aid to reach the region. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Japan has pledged nearly five million dollars in cash and supplies, and France says it is sending a cargo plane loaded with tents, sleeping bags, tarps, and cooking kits. ALEX CHADWICK, host : The earthquake is spurring private relief efforts here, in the U.S. as well. Nearly one fifth of San Francisco is Chinese-American, and for many, the distant disaster feels very close. From member station KQED, David Gorn, reports. DAVID GORN : On the top floor of China Town's Baptist Church about 30 recent immigrants are taking a literacy class.   ..TEXT: (Soundbite of people speaking Chinese) DAVID GORN : Teacher Mimi Wong(ph) is talking about the subject on everyone's mind, the 7.9 earthquake that shook central China Monday. She has an envelope at the front of the class for people to make donations for earthquake relief. Even though these immigrants don't have much money, they slip a check into the envelope on their way into, or out of class. Wong tears up as she asks her students when they first heard about the earthquake? Ms. MIMI WONG (English Teacher) : (Through Translator) We are just kind of sad. That's way I'm a little emotional. He just said that is so sad inside, that we are just numb with grief. DAVID GORN : None of the students in this adult literacy class is from the quake region. Like most of the Chinese-American population in this area, they come from southern China. They may not have friends, or family members affected by the quake, but says Wong, they all still the full weight of the disaster. Ms. MIMI WONG (English Teacher) : (Through translator) Because we are Chinese, we are bonded together. DAVID GORN : Later Wong says she'll walk that envelope, stuffed with donations, down to the local Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao. The advertising office there is collecting money to give to the Red Cross.  The paper ran a full page ad asking for donations. Editor Tim Lau says the response, so far, has been overwhelming. Mr. TIM LAU (Editor, Sing Tao) : When the readers read about the ad, they go straight to our local office in San Francisco's China Town and there's a line out there. People are lining up to donate money to the earthquake victims. DAVID GORN : At the head of that line to donate is Marina Lu(ph).  She says that everyone in her family, her father, her brother, her sister, they all plan to give. In fact, when the newspaper tries to take her picture because she's the first one to donate, she says no, she doesn't want any kind of special recognition. Ms. MARINA LU : Everybody is very shocked, you know, even though we are not living over there right, but we are Chinese. We feel the shock, like everybody around the world. You know, everybody should be doing something. DAVID GORN : Across the Bay Bridge to Oakland. This working class city has a partnership with earthquake ravaged Mianyang, China.  They are friendship cities, similar to sister cities. Oakland City Councilman, Henry Chang was born in China, and says he's visited Mianyang about a dozen times in the last decade. So far, he hasn't been able to reach anyone he knows there. Councilman HENRY CHANG (Oakland City Councilman) : There is over 7,000 people that die from that, and also at least, another 18,000 is right now still bury. DAVID GORN : Chang is offered to send a search and rescue team from Oakland to Mianyang. It's the same crew, he says, that went to New York City after 9/11. And he says it's one of the few teams in the country that specialize in finding, and pulling people, from collapsed buildings. Chang worries when they arrive in China, it may be even more chaotic than September 11th. Councilman HENRY CHANG (Oakland City Councilman) : When I heard 7.9, knowing the type of structure over there, in China mostly like bricks and other reinforced type of structure, so I know that it is going to be really tough. DAVID GORN : Chang learned from his many trips to Mianyang that it's a poor city, and will take years to rebuild. The Chinese American community here in the Bay area, has been willing to step up in the past, after the Indian Ocean Tsunami, the Sin Tao newspaper group raised more than a million dollars. This time they expect donations will far exceed that total. \n\n ###",

(Staff Writer, Wall Street Journal): Well, they are looking at some of the fundamentals that are out there, particularly, the lack of what we call \"spare capacity,\" that is amount that someone could bring online if there was a real jolt to the system, and that has typically been Saudi Arabia that actually has the ability to do that. At that moment, their ability is down to about two percent of what the world consumes every day. We consume about 86 million barrels a day. MADELEINE BRAND, host : The Saudis might, in a pinch, be able to bring on about two million barrels, and there's also just a general downward trend in a lot of the countries that the world has relied on for a long time. Mexico, production is going down there rather dramatically. It may stop being an oil exporter altogether within four or five years, as it's going now. And where the biggest pools of oil are in places like Iraq or Iran where there are difficulties, obvious ones, in getting investors to get what there is. So, it's like a compounded problem. MADELEINE BRAND, host : And meanwhile demand is increasing? Mr. KING : It is. It's actually decreasing at the moment in the United States, and largely because we are a lot more price-sensitive than many other parts of the world. But the big pinch, which isn't noticed all that much, is actually in the oil-producing countries itself is one of the biggest demand increases, particularly in Saudi Arabia and in Gulf countries. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Now, in your article, you quote an analyst as saying that at 150 dollars a barrel, which is not too far away from 120, that would put prices at, quote, \"an unprecedented level, even going back to just after the Civil War.\" What will that mean for prices at the pump? Mr. KING : He was figuring, this being someone that works for the Federal Reserve in Dallas, that 150 would push gas prices to at least $4.50. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Well, and then next year, 200 dollars, according to Goldman Sachs, what would that translate into? Mr. KING : Whoa, that would - I mean, that's the kind of price level that you would see a serious impact on the U.S. economy. I mean, that would at least be six, perhaps even upwards towards seven dollars a gallon. And what was amazing, Goldman was saying that this was sort of an outlier possibility, but they were saying that there was a decent chance of oil averaging 200 dollars a barrel next year and that would - I mean, that would have really huge impact. Mr. KING : The thing is, is that at the moment, we have no real ability to bring on big amount of supply to ease all this. But any real downward turn in demand would change the equation a lot. So, that's the thing that a lot of people are looking at now. MADELEINE BRAND, host : So, they're just hoping that people will, long before it gets to seven dollars a gallon, will say, oh, my gosh, I've got to use less and that will lower the price. Mr. KING : That that will happen, that even that kind of stress will push not only people to change their behavior, but also push other things, technology and other forms of fuel, et cetera, that much faster, that will then make up the difference, but - and that will be equal to change in demand, at least for petroleum products. MADELEINE BRAND, host : That's Neil King. He writes for the Wall Street Journal. Neil, thank you. Mr. KING : I appreciate it. Thanks. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Wow, gas at seven dollars a gallon? I think that price spike will hit a lot of drivers like a Mack truck. Here's a sample from the littlest engines to the big dogs on the road, of what it would cost to fill up at seven dollars a gallon. Unidentified Man : Say, bro, is that a Yaris? MADELEINE BRAND, host : Don't call it hatchback or a gas guzzler. Toyota's Yaris lift-back packs a very practical 11.1 gallon tank. Still, at seven dollars a gallon, it'll take almost 78 bucks to fill the tank of this little sporty ride. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Buy American if you want to, but stars-and-stripes luxury could cost you about 126 dollars to fill a Buick Lucerne with seven-dollar gas. Today's Chevy Impala is a new twist on an old-school favorite. What will get old quick is the 119 dollars that you'll pump into that tank. MADELEINE BRAND, host : Unidentified Announcer #1: Stop in and see your Chevrolet dealer for the greatest show on work. \n\n ###",

FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Earlier today, Tony sat down with our sports guru, New York Times writer Bill Rhoden. TONY COX : Hey, Bill. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : The great Tony Cox again. TONY COX : Yeah. What's up? Listen, we have Kobe who may be on the trading block, Major League Baseball may be instituting instant replay, and Randy Moss and T.O. may have finally found the right uniforms. TONY COX : So let's start with baseball, Bill, because the Red Sox and Cleveland, as we all know, played today. And Colorado's waiting in the wings after having already plowed through the National League. But as we approach the World Series - before you talk about whether you think Colorado can do what, you know, Florida and the Angels and Arizona have also done in this millennium - instant replay is on the table again in Major League Baseball. Commissioner Bud Selig says, he hates it, but he's willing to talk about it. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Well I think we're going to see it. You know, in 2005, Bud said, I hate it. In 2006, he said, well, no. In 2007, he's just less talk. So I think that - I think, Tony, that we're one big gaff away in the World Series, one major blunder ofhaving instant replay and I think what's going to happen is that we're first going to have it in the spring training on a limited basis. TONY COX : On a tryout basis? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Yeah, tryout bases, but I predict in about two to three seasons, we're going to have instant replay. In about 17 years, our grandchildren will be saying, what? You guys never had instant replay? Wow, what kind\u2026 TONY COX : They needed to. Hey, let's talk about Colorado for a moment. I mean, the Cinderella team of the year, they went what, 21 out of 22 at the end of their last run and are heading into the World Series. TONY COX : Are they going to be able to do what the Angels did, what Florida Marlins did, what the Arizona Diamondbacks did, coming in and surprising people and winning the whole thing? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : I don't think there's any reason that they can't, Tony. I mean, beyond Cinderella, they've got a tremendous left hook, you know. They are a great hitting team. They've always been a great hitting team historically. This year, they are an outstanding pitching team. They've got great beliefs in themselves. If you just looked at them, they're in a streak - it's a winning streak. They picked each other up. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Their confidence, Tony, is just so high, always very cautious against this. You know, baseball is not like football, basketball where a momentum is something made. You don't really have that kind of momentum in baseball. So I think this dead period now while they are waiting might be the only thing to kind of throw some cold water on their hot streak. TONY COX : Talking about\u2026 Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : But I like them - I like them a lot. TONY COX : All right, talking about hot streaks, nobody in the major sports world right now, at least in American sport, is on a hotter streak than the New England Patriots who are undefeated and, you know, talk is starting to begin, Bill Rhoden, that this may be a comparison to the 1972 Miami Dolphins who went undefeated. Is it fair comparison? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : It's beyond fair, Tony. I mean, this team is great. And if no one gets hurt, if none of their key guys gets hurt, man, I think they're going to run the team. If Brady doesn't get hurt, if Stallworth - Donte Stallworth doesn't get hurt, if that passing game stays intact, they've got a great running game, the defense is just beginning to pick up. Seymour just came back, Rodney Harrison came back, I mean, I think that's kind of like in bad West, you know, and you can run that Boston. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : I think Ross is all you'd be with players out there. TONY COX : So you like them? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : I like New England. I like - put it like this, I like New England's chances of running the table. \n\n ###",

Let's talk about somebody who's a part of making that happen and somebody who isn't. And these are the two number 81s, Randy Moss and Terrell Owens. It seemed as if, at least in Randy Moss' case, putting on a New England Patriot uniform all of a sudden made him a nice guy again. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Well, let's not go that far. I mean, I don't think - I mean, I don't think he's ever not a nice guy. I just think that he - there are some character issues that were brought up by losing. And we don't see those characters issues yet because everything is wonderful. He's never had - he's never been in a system like that - like New England - since, I'd argue, since Minnesota with Daunte Culpepper.

TONY COX : Let's talk about another level of football right now as a matter of fact. Let's talk about college football. TONY COX : The BCS rankings came out this week as you know. Ohio State hard to believe, number one right now, but I can't - and South Florida number 2. I can't see them staying in those positions the rest of the way, can you? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Yeah, well, you kind of - I mean, this is, you know, unlike previous years, which are less - I think three or four years where one loss would base - you almost had to be perfect to play for the national championship. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : This year, I think you can lose a game, two games, and to be honest with you, Tony, South Florida really should be number one. They really should be number one. I just think the voters just couldn't bring themselves to vote for South Florida. But South Florida has kind of got a going on. TONY COX : Well if they beat Rutgers in their game scheduled for today, maybe they will move up into the number one spot for next week. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Well, they should. I like that. TONY COX : One more thing before we get away. There's a guy out here in California who needs a team to play for. He's tall, scores pretty well, good defender, but the owner of the team doesn't like him anymore. His name is Jerry Buss. Kobe Bryant, is there a team that could take him, would be interested in taking Kobe? And who might that be? Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : New York, New York, the Big Apple. Please, Kobe, please come to New York. He would be tremendously appreciated here. This should - this is the\u2026 TONY COX : But they said they didn't - Isaiah says they don't want him. Mr. WILLIAM RHODEN (Writer, New York Times; Author, \"Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumphs of the Black Quarterback\") : Well\u2026 TONY COX : He just said no, no. You just said that. \n\n ###",

From NPR News, I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host : I'm Alex Chadwick.  Sunday is Mother's Day.  The question of becoming a mother, or at least giving birth, is at the heart of a documentary that comes out today on DVD.  The Business of Being Born is a critique of hospital birth in the U.S.  The film offers home birth and midwives as remedies.  Eve Troeh reports. EVE TROEH : Ricki Lake. Yes, the Ricki Lake, actor and talk show host, had her first baby in a hospital in New York.  She didn't want drugs.  She didn't want induced labor.  She got both.  Her son was born healthy, but she felt out of control. Ms. RICKI LAKE (Actor, Talk Show Host) : It made me think twice the second time around, wanting to be in that setting at all. EVE TROEH : Lake started going to midwife conferences, training to be a birth coach, and learning everything she could about natural birth. Ms. RICKI LAKE (Actor, Talk Show Host) : It's another world.  What they believe, the research that they do.  I mean it's just - this information wasn't really accessible to the regular folk like me. EVE TROEH : Lake and her friend, filmmaker Abby Epstein, set out to change that.  They spent three years following Manhattan midwives, filming home births, and interviewing experts to make the business of being born.  It's gained a following among moms-to-be.  I sat down to watch the movie with two pregnant women in Los Angeles, both first-time moms.  Maryann Oberley(ph), about seven months along, was a bit reluctant. Ms. MARYANN OBERLEY (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : I didn't know if I wanted to watch it or not, because I want to have my baby in the hospital, I'll probably use drugs if I feel like I need them.  So I was worried that it was going to try to scare me out of that, or preach to me too much. EVE TROEH : The other woman, Julie Mullin(ph), has a bigger baby bump at 34 weeks.  She's seen more friends and relatives seek out natural birth. Ms. JULIE MULLIN (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : It seems like there's been a lot of prejudice against pain medication and child birth.  People were like, oh, women are supposed to suffer in childbirth, so I'm curious that the pendulum's sort of swinging back the other way. EVE TROEH : Both women cooed over the home birth scenes, including footage of Ricki Lake herself.  She had her second son at home, in her bath tub, and you see it all. EVE TROEH : The water can be so cool.  Again, mom-to-be Julie Mullin. Ms. JULIE MULLIN (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : I mean, definitely, it's something to consider.  That just looks so much more comfortable in a lot of ways than lying on a bed. Ms. MARYANN OBERLEY (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : And it's wonderful to see births like - it's just - it was just so beautiful. EVE TROEH : That's Maryann Oberley. Ms. MARYANN OBERLEY (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : As long as you go into it knowing like, whatever I've decided for myself, I've decided and it's okay to stick to it even, if these people have a very different opinion. EVE TROEH : Producer Ricki Lake says, the business of being born is not about judging women's decisions.  It just presents options. Ms. RICKI LAKE (Actor, Talk Show Host) : It is not about have a home birth like me, at all.  I mean, I think it's about educating yourself, and empowering yourself to make the choice that's best for you, because I think so many times, you know we spend more time researching what camera we're going to buy, or what TV set we need in our home, instead of, you know, what is the best care provider for me, during this most precious time in my life.  Women or the consumer needs to know, they have choices. Ms. HARRIET HALL (Retired Family Doctor) : If the consumers wanted something that we tested scientifically, and found out that it wasn't in their best interest, I don't think we would want to do it. EVE TROEH : Harriet Hall is a retired family doctor.  She reviewed the business of being born for the website Science-Based Medicine.  Hall says the film is moving, but short on scientific fact.  Statistics in it suggests, the infant mortality rate and the number of C-sections would go down, if there were more midwives and home births. \n\n ###",

We need to test the things that they do, that are different from hospital births, find out if they really give better outcome or not. EVE TROEH : Hall says the film presents a dichotomy, rather than a broad range of options, like bringing midwives into hospitals, where obstetricians can back them up.  The film shows doctors with a few exceptions, as controlling birth.  In one montage, nurses talk about Pitocin or Pit, a drug that induces labor. EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #1:  Hit her, means you are basically instructing the nurse to start Pitocin. EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #2:  I asked to keep upping the Pit. EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #1:  Probably about 90% of our patients at some point, are on some type of augmentation. EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #22:  Which is not anywhere near adequacy so (inaudible). EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #1:  If you're not making that change in that segment of time that they were looking for, then we're going to try to facilitate things. EVE TROEH : Unidentified Nurse #2:  Or maybe start Pit. EVE TROEH : The moms-to-be, who watched with me, Julie and Maryann, felt the hospital births didn't get fair shake. Ms. JULIE MULLIN (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : Actually, it probably would have been cool, if we'd seen some positive hospital births, too. Ms. MARYANN OBERLEY (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : Because it was ironic.  I thought that they had mentioned in the movie like, women are thought to be terrified of birth, and then all they showed were scary things. Ms. JULIE MULLIN (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : Of hospital births, yeah. EVE TROEH : Practically and financially, Julie Mullin(ph) doesn't see how home birth would work for her, even though she's now open to it. Ms. JULIE MULLIN (Pregnant, First-time Mom) : I kind of got it all of a sudden, like yeah, you know maybe this really would be a good option.  I have no idea how I'd even work that now,you know, with an HMO. EVE TROEH : Neither woman wants to put expectations on herself for her first birth. Both know several women who tried to do natural birth and weren't able. One birth in the film speaks to that. The movie's director, Abby Epstein, learned she's pregnant while shooting the film. After all her research on the topic, she decides to go with home birth. MADELEINE BRAND, host : It doesn't go as planned. Ms. RICKI LAKE (Actor, Talk Show Host) : Should I get this cab? Unidentified Man : Yeah, yeah. Ms. EPSTEIN : Please go. It's really hurting. Oh, my God. This (bleep) (bleep).  I want to get there. I cannot have another contraction in this taxi cab. Ms. RICKI LAKE (Actor, Talk Show Host) : You know, it was so interesting. It's like life and art kind of coming together. \n\n ###",

Hi, John. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Hi there. ALEX COHEN, host : So, you just heard this conversation with Senator McGovern. What do you make of it? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : It's a big deal because McGovern is not some crazy person running around having random opinions. He's not a pundit, and he was a former Clinton supporter, or sort of still is. But he has evaluated the outcome and said, you know, essentially, she should hang it up. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Now, this is the kind of conventional wisdom, not that she should leave the race, but that she had a bad night and that the math is so stacked against her that it's impossible, and he has now ratified that view, and as a kind of party elder, that adds some weight to this pressure that's on Senator Clinton. ALEX COHEN, host : So, in light of this news, and last night we have Barack Obama winning the primary in North Carolina, Clinton taking Indiana but just barely. Is there any realistic chance that she can turn this around? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Well, it's a very, very, very slim chance. It got slimmer after the primaries in North Carolina and Indiana. I was just on a conference call with her campaign staff, and here is their case. It's the best possible case they can try to make. First is that they are going to try to turn this whole election into West Virginia, which is the next contest. Hey, fortunately for Clinton it's a contest in which she's likely to do very well. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : They're also trying to argue to seat the delegations from Florida and Michigan, those sort of \"limbo\" delegates who have been written out of the process by the Democratic National Committee. And then the third argument they make is that if you look at the right polls in the right way, Hillary Clinton sets up better against John McCain than Barack Obama does. Those are all debatable points. They are points. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : The problem with them though is that none of them are terribly new, and none of them are strong enough to convince these superdelegates, and it's really all about the superdelegates now, that they should reverse the trend that has gone so far, which is the trend among the pledged delegates, and among the superdelegates. Barack Obama has won them basically about five to one since Super Tuesday. ALEX COHEN, host : This morning, the Hillary Clinton campaign revealed that over the past month that the senator has loaned her own campaign 6.4 million dollars, and this is the second time that she's made such a personal loan. How long can the Clinton campaign run itself this way? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : The question is this, how does this affect her ability to raise money outside of her own fortune? Which is one of the facts she'll use to argue to superdelegates. She will basically say, look at all these people, if they exist, and the campaign has been silent about the money they raised on the Internet so far since Indiana. This suggests she may not be doing very well in the fundraising front. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : And she needs to be able to show that she can fundraise to make an argument to superdelegates, hey, don't go to Barack Obama as you have been, but stick with me because people are still writing me checks, which means the regular people and humans in the country still have faith in my candidacy, and therefore you, Mr. and Mrs. Superdelegate, should have the same kind of faith. ALEX COHEN, host : John, the first line in your piece this morning refers to the Democratic election, which, you write, seems at times designed by Willy Wonka. I assume by that you don't mean covered in chocolate. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : No, that would - if it were covered in chocolate, it might be a pleasant affair. So far it's been, you know, had these twists and turns in which, for those of us covering it, has been fantastic, and the polls actually show the Democrats are - about 60 percent of them are still happy for this drama to continue. But last night's victory, we thought we had a split - victory by Hillary Clinton. We thought she had won Indiana and Barack Obama had won North Carolina. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Obama had given to her - conceded to her, essentially, on Indiana, and then we had this pause of a couple of hours, two or three hours, where it looked for a moment or two like Barack Obama, because his one county that he did very well in was coming on strong in the end there, because it took a long time to count the votes, that it looked like perhaps he might win both states of the evening. What it ended up doing though is shrinking Hillary Clinton's margin down quite a lot, which diminished her victory in Indiana a bit. ALEX COHEN, host : So, when is it going to be over? When are we going to have one candidate? Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Well, we don't know. There are three, I guess, possibilities that come to the top of my mind immediately. One is that the superdelegates look at the results from Tuesday and just decide to rush to Barack Obama. Some will certainly go to him, but that kind of a rush is unlikely. Superdelegates are kind of cautious people by nature. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : The other option available for superdelegates is that, in June, when all of the primaries and caucuses are over, that they then would make a decision. And then the third is that the superdelegates may make their decision, and the margin would not be enough to put pressure on Senator Clinton to withdraw from the race, and that she then continues to fight, and then takes it all the way to the convention and tries to get herself the nomination there. ALEX COHEN, host : Either way, doesn't look like you're going to be bored any time soon. Slate.com's political correspondent, John Dickerson, thanks. Mr. JOHN DICKERSON (Chief Political Correspondent, Slate.com) : Thank you. \n\n ###",

Zimbabwe is in dire straits. Inflation is at more than 6,000 percent. There are shortages of gas, cooking, oil, bread, sugar and salt. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Machivenyika Mapuranga is Zimbabwe's ambassador to the United States. We talked about one of the most well-known incidents in Zimbabwe's recent history when President Robert Mugabe began seizing the land of white farmers of British descent. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Many international observers say this was the tipping point in Zimbabwe's decline. But Ambassador Mapuranga says the story goes back further to a point where the United Kingdom promised to compensate white farmers for leaving Zimbabwe and then broke that promise. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : When the British reneged on that promise to fund the land reform program, the government went to parliament to pass legislation and even to amend the constitution to enable government to acquire land forcibly because before then, land could not be acquired forcibly. You know, it was not to say the white farmers must leave, even as we speak today. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : People don't know that Zimbabwe today, as we speak, has the third largest number of white farmers after South Africa and Namibia. We used to be number two after South Africa with something like - 4,500. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ambassador, I'm not going to argue that point with you. But what - a couple points. One is that, undeniably, the amount of agricultural output has gone down. And whether or not you think that that's a function of land redistribution, there is an economic crisis. Why do you think then that that happened? And what are you going to do about it? Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : Yes. So in terms of agricultural production - yes, definitely. You cannot gainsay the fact that the acquisition of these vast tracts of land by people who had been denied the opportunity to become commercial farmers has contributed to the food shortages. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : You know, I've always been asked this question, you shouldn't have done that, why did you do that? Because you were not - you, Africans, are not good farmers. And I've always said that how can you become a good farmer if you don't have the land? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ambassador, how much time do you think you have? There's very little cooking oil, there's very little sugar, there's not even mealy(ph) meal in some places. And I'll just put the currency issue in a frame. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : When I went to Zimbabwe in 1997, there were 10 Zim dollars to one U.S. dollar. By the time I came back in 2001, on the parallel market or the illegal currency market, it was 300 Zim dollars to one U.S. dollar. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, you can get well over 250,000 Zim dollars to one U.S. dollar. That is crushing to everyday people. While you were waiting to figure out how to turn around the nation, do you expect people to stay in the country or do you expect this mass exodus to continue? Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : Well, let me - I wouldn't call it a mass exodus. You know, if you look at the phenomenon of the brain drain or people leaving the country, going to South Africa and wherever the pastures are greener, this is an eternal - this is a universal phenomenon. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : Even here, when you have the richest economy, the United States here and you have poor Mexico, you know, to the South, Americans are having to - maybe to construct a wall or a virtual wall, and the question of immigration is top of the agenda of Congress here. Whenever you have a dire economic situation, people leave for greener pastures. So this is not something that is peculiar to Zimbabwe. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : Independence is not about having a flag in the national anthem. You have to control your natural resources and own your economy. And this is what we are heading towards, and we are going to suffer for that. But we are experimenting and actually exploring a new paradigm of development in Africa. And I think that the rest of Africa will follow us in the near future. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ambassador, before we let you go, I want to move to the topic of elections. In July, we spoke with Arthur Mutambara. He is part of one of the factions of the Zimbabwean Movement for Democratic Change, one of the opposition parties. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Here's a little bit of what he said. Mr. ARTHUR MUTAMBARA (President, Movement for Democratic Change, Zimbabwe) : The three elements to Zimbabwean national crisis - on the first one, on political illegitimacy, what we're saying is those who are running the country called Zimbabwe are doing so without the consent of the governed. They empower through a fraudulent election. So the starting point in Zimbabwe is to make sure there are free and fair elections, the two wings of the MDC. We are working together in this mediation. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Ambassador, first of all, were the past elections fair and free? And secondly, what are you going to do in the future? Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : Well, the question of free and fair elections never became a question or an issue until the land reform program was launched in 2000 - in the year 2000. Dr. MACHIVENYIKA MAPURANGA (Zimbabwe's Ambassador to the United States) : The first democratic elections in Zimbabwe were organized and conducted by the last British governor, Lord Soames, and he said, Robert Mugabe, your party has won. You form a government. And every five years, we have had elections observed and validated by Africa's continental organization, the OAU, and - and our - the regional organization that we belong to, SADEC. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan in Concord, New Hampshire. Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Ron Paul will debate who won last night, but as usual, the Iowa caucuses provided much more clarity on who lost. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This morning, Michele Bachmann ended her campaign. After returning to Texas to reassess, Rick Perry decided to skip New Hampshire and go directly to South Carolina. Newt Gingrich is already here in New Hampshire with plans to get even for the negative ads that pummeled him into fourth place in Iowa. NEWT GINGRICH : We are not going to go out and run nasty ads. We're not going to go out and run 30-second gotcha ads. We're not... NEWT GINGRICH : But I do reserve the right to tell the truth. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Political junkie Ken Rudin joins us here in New Hampshire to help us figure out what happened to the three one-time frontrunners and what that tells us about the Republican Party and the race for the presidential nomination. Matt Bai of the New York Times also joins us. Plus later in the program, one of the Iraqi interpreters who faces death threats because he worked for U.S. troops. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But first, the other candidates in Iowa. If your candidate finished out of the top tier in the caucuses, where does your support go now? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Political junkie Ken Rudin joins us here in the studios at New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord. Hey, Ken. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Hi Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Matt Bai of the New York Times with us from Studio 3A back in Washington, D.C. Hey, Matt. MATT BAI : Hi, Neal, how are you doing? Nice to talk to you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good to have you back on. Each of the Iowa also-rans led the GOP field in opinion polls at one point or another. Ken, obviously Michele Bachmann is out. Do any of the others have the resources to get back into serious contention? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, Rick Perry's shown that he does have the resources. As a matter of fact, he blanketed Iowa with a multi-million-dollar ad campaign, but it didn't do him very good, obviously - a poor fifth place. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : I think a lot of the voters got their initial impression of the candidates through the debates, and Rick Perry stumbled - once he began stumbling and stumbling, he never recovered. Whereas Rick Santorum was completely ignored during the debates. He was, you know, the outlier. Most questions did not go to him. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And while everybody was focusing on the so-called frontrunners, the Michele Bachmanns, the others, Santorum was out in the field raising funds and getting votes. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Matt Bai, you did a really interesting piece on Newt Gingrich in the New York Times Magazine, and I wanted to ask you, he was feeling the hand of destiny a little bit, of greatness, as you put it. But he's been seemingly angered by what happened to him in Iowa and, as we just heard, seemingly vowing to run a scorched-earth campaign here in New Hampshire. MATT BAI : Yeah, he is, Neal. I don't really know what's going on. He - you know, he was saying - he was telling everybody, and he was telling me in Iowa that not only, you know, did he want to run this positive campaign, but the one time he'd gone negative, when he stood up at a debate and said about Mitt Romney, you know, the only reason you're not a career politician is because you lost to Ted Kennedy, his numbers dropped. MATT BAI : And he seemed convinced that actually being the positive candidate was the thing that was fueling him. It may be that he's decided that was not the right way to go and that in fact you can't answer negative attacks by just being positive. It may just be that he was just emotionally really angry last night. MATT BAI : You know, I think, you know, my own sense of it is there's probably a value in fighting back. You can't say negative campaigning doesn't ever work. But I'm not sure there's a value in telling people you're going to be negatively campaigning. MATT BAI : And even though he said he wasn't going to run negative ads, I think he certainly left the impression, as you say, that he's going to come out full-bore in New Hampshire. And I think to the extent that that underscores the old image of Newt Gingrich as kind of a guy who will get down and personal, it probably doesn't benefit him with a lot of the people who might otherwise support him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as you point out, as we look forward to those two campaign debates before - between now and primary day here in New Hampshire, there are few better at withering scorn than Newt Gingrich. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### MATT BAI : Yeah, I mean, that's his milieu, and don't forget not only the two in New Hampshire and then a very big one in South Carolina, which will be closely watched, too, and I think he intends to stay at least through there. So that is a great, you know, forum for Gingrich. The question is: Does he come out and be that confident, positive guy who can dominate a debate, simply because he's incredibly articulate and can sort of heap scorn on the president or on the moderators, in a way that Republican voters find compelling? MATT BAI : Or does he - you know, does he use that quick mind-to-mouth ability that he has to start attacking the people around him? And I think it's possible - I've always felt that New Hampshire was the danger zone for Gingrich, because it's - as you know, Neal, and you're there now, both of you are, it's a cauldron, it's a week-long cauldron. MATT BAI : Everything's very close together. There's a huge media crush everywhere. It's all very compact, and if you're going to break down or give in to exhaustion or make a mental mistake, it's probably going to be there. That's where things happen. MATT BAI : You know, and I think it's a danger zone for Gingrich because he is given to speaking rashly, off-the-cuff. He is given to impulse, and I think that's where that discipline issue that people often raise with him, you know, poses him more danger, perhaps, than it did in Iowa. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah, Matt, I agree with you completely. I mean, I think one of the most amazing stories of this campaign year was the rise of Newt Gingrich, the fact that we all had such negative opinions of him. By the time he left Congress in early 1999, he probably was the most unpopular politician in America. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And yet during the debates, we saw him insist that he would not attack his fellow Republicans, and he got - he moved up and up and up in the polls because of it. And so for him to go - now his ads won't go negative, but for him to go negative in... NEAL CONAN, HOST : He doesn't have any money for ads. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, there's that, too, but I mean, but he has the opportunity to go negative in Saturday and Sunday's debates, and if that's the case, perhaps the specter of the old Gingrich comes back to haunt him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And this, the Gingrich who you compared in the piece, he compared himself to figures like Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle and Ronald Reagan re-emerging from the wilderness to feel the hand of destiny guiding him toward greatness and pulling his country out of the abyss. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And remember when he couldn't get on the Virginia ballot, his campaign likened it to Pearl Harbor. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well... But he - go ahead, Matt. MATT BAI : No, I was going to say, I think that - you know, I think in a sense that is what drives Newt Gingrich and what makes him formidable. It's - you know, he could have gone away. A lot of candidates would have gone away. It was a dark period. Tim Pawlenty got out, you know, and probably regretted it, with less to be humiliated about than Newt Gingrich, who went through a complete drubbing and writing-off by all of us, and a lot of Republicans. MATT BAI : The thing that keeps him going is this inner sense of his own value on the historical stage. People make fun of it and lampoon it, but he believes it. It keeps him going. It makes him - it's always made him resilient. And I don't write him off. I mean, he had a bad showing, certainly, in Iowa, given where he was a few weeks ago, but not given where he was a few months ago. MATT BAI : New Hampshire is a different state. He's a good political tactician, if not a great retail candidate, and I still feel that the field is very unsettled and fluid. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you supported someone who did not end up in the top tier in Iowa, of course that's Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul, where does your support go now? Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Barrett(ph), Barrett's on the line with us from Casco in Washington. BARRETT : Hi, yes, I - thanks for having me. So really I'm a young conservative and just right of center, though. I feel like this race is, if anything, making me more of a moderate. Because the choices in front of us, if you're a GOP voter, basically we have a bunch of guys leapfrogging out of a clown car. I mean, they're terrible. BARRETT : Keep in mind that the end game is that we've got to elect someone who can beat President Obama in a general election in this country, and we don't have that person. I was most inclined to support Jon Huntsman. That's a guy I know, I feel strongly, that he could pull in moderates. BARRETT : And, you know, he is not looking like a viable option. Look what happened in Iowa. We have Mitt Romney by eight votes - over Rick Santorum? You know, so this thing is changing week to week. It's fluid absolutely, but the endgame is we're probably going to end up with Romney, and he's terrible. I can't get excited about any of these other candidates. BARRETT : The most sensible, the most credible, the most genuine, I think, has been Jon Huntsman. You know, Romney is a moderate squish from Massachusetts. He's basically like the lost son of the Kennedy clan. \n\n ###",

He's not very genuine. He doesn't connect well with people. And I... NEAL CONAN, HOST : It was interesting, there was an ad that Newt Gingrich ran in the Manchester Union Leader this morning, Matt Bai, who called Mitt Romney a timid moderate Massachusetts - a timid Massachusetts moderate. But the word moderate these days in the Republican Party is a little bit like calling him a terrorist. MATT BAI : It is. I mean, there's nothing - being timid and moderate are about the worst things you could be in this Republican field. Somebody ought to give Barrett a radio show because I think he's - I liked his summation. I mean, look, that is - that is the story of this season. MATT BAI : No matter which way you cut it, no matter who emerges or rises, it is dissatisfaction among Republican voters with their choices. There are a lot of Republicans who woke up this morning and thought that Iowa should just lose its license to caucus for having, you know, basically elevated Ron Paul and Rick Santorum alongside Mitt Romney, who very few, you know, conservative activists feel they can support. MATT BAI : So, you know, I think it was a good night for Romney, and I think he's the guy, you know, I think he would have taken that scenario in a heartbeat. But - and I think a lot of Republicans will ultimately rally around him if he, you know, tears through New Hampshire as we think he will. MATT BAI : But I think there are a lot of conservative voters today feeling like Barrett does. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But before we completely forget about her campaign, Michele Bachmann was on the cover of Time Magazine this past summer, winner of the Ames straw poll and has, today, bowed out of the race. What mark does she leave on this campaign, Matt Bai? MATT BAI : Well, I'm grateful that the Iowa straw poll has lost its credibility in this process, because it's one of the more shameful processes in American politics, I think - in terms of just plain buying votes and not being representative of a whole lot. MATT BAI : I mean, you know, I was down in South Carolina last week, where Bachmann had a pretty strong organization. It's there she would have gone, not to New Hampshire. She wasn't really - she had, you know, an organization there, but she wasn't really polling well or catching on. MATT BAI : I think, you know, like all of these candidates have been - have shown some real flaws from the beginning of the process. And I think if you talk to people about Michele Bachmann, the fact that she said a bunch of things half-cocked that turned out not to be true, the lack of experience, I think for Republican voters that was a real problem in her credibility and a real problem for envisioning her as someone who could run against Barack Obama. And I don't think there was a path forward for her. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking about the other candidates in Iowa. If your candidate finished out of the top tier in the caucuses, where does your support go now? 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Matt Bai of the New York Times is with us, also political junkie Ken Rudin. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan, broadcasting today from the studios at New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord. Jon Huntsman this morning called the results in Iowa kind of a jumbled-up outcome. The former Utah governor and current candidate for the Republican nomination says the race is still wide open. He's not giving up. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Newt Gingrich, for his part, promised a more aggressive campaign and vowed to go after frontrunner Mitt Romney every day. Texas Governor Rick Perry will skip New Hampshire and focus now on South Carolina. We're talking about the other candidates, other than those who finished in the top tier in Iowa.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Our guests are Political Junkie Ken Rudin, with us here in the Granite State, and Matt Bai, chief political correspondent for the New York Times magazine. And let's get another caller on the line. We'll go to Steve, and Steve's on the line from Flint, Michigan. STEVE : Hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Hi. Go ahead, please. STEVE : Yeah, basically, I really love the character of Michele Bachmann. I think that she demonstrated a principle of service, adopting so many children and taking care of them. You don't find that in a politician. The closest thing I think you've come today in the mix is Mitt Romney, and Mitt Romney, I believe, has similar acts of great character, whether it is his service or devotion. STEVE : You know, he stepped out of business to run the Olympics, not to make money, but to help that organization recover from its chaos and corruption. He's demonstrated over his lifetime, whether it's his service as a young man going away and serving his church for two years, it's consistent with the traits of Bachmann, where she - you know, she does - I don't know. She lives a life that she says that she's going to do. It's just not hype. It's not - it's just not an image. It's the real person behind the act. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Steve, I understand you would have preferred Michele Bachmann to Mitt Romney. Your support goes to him now. But she spent a lot of time saying, you know, he wasn't a true conservative. \n\n ###",

And if you want to pick the true conservative, I think you have to go to Rick Santorum, and he's also, I think, a fine man. But I think at the end of the day, you know, this country needs a leader who has character more than it does somebody who's at a polar end of any spectrum. And I think that's what we have today, a person at a polar end of a spectrum. STEVE : And you look at Romney, who's a very wealthy man, and in this environment that kind of plays against him, but he's given millions to charities. On the other hand, you have Obama who, basically, while serving people all his life in the acts of service, has managed somehow to become a millionaire. And I don't know how people who are genuinely serving are able to do that. STEVE : I understand how a businessman can be successful and make millions and then turn around and give it away, but - and that's what Mitt has been doing, and Bachmann not so much giving money away but giving her time and devotion to others. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think the president wrote a couple of bestselling books, and that'll do it for you. But Ken Rudin, I think what Steve is talking about is electability, and I think that's going to becoming more and more of a focus. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, polls show, coming out of the Iowa caucuses, those who feel that beating President Obama is - those Republicans who feel that beating President Obama is the number one priority, Mitt Romney did by far the best. But those who adhere to true conservative principles, Mitt Romney's numbers on those were very far, you know, short of that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Matt Bai, there's the - we're talking about the cap back in Iowa. Mitt Romney got the same 25 percent in Iowa he got four years ago, when he could not convince people he could break through that limit. Obviously, he'll do better than that here in New Hampshire. Are you going to be looking ahead to South Carolina? MATT BAI : I am looking ahead to South Carolina. In fact, I really enjoyed listening to you down there. There's a lot of driving around the state. It was good to have that to entertain me. MATT BAI : You know, I don't think it's a problem - I don't think the percentage is a problem if you're Romney. I understand why people will jump on him for it, and I understand why the president's people want to call him, you know, the 25-percent man and all this. MATT BAI : The fact is Mitt Romney's basically run a general election campaign to this point. He's made a calculation - and I think a smart one to this point - that there's nobody in that field who can actually beat him. And, in a sense, the best thing that can happen to Mitt Romney is to survive the primaries rather than make a convincing statement in all these states, get by with a percentage of the vote that's not very impressive to political insiders, but come out without having taken positions or gone on the offensive in a way to earn the respect of the right wing of his party. MATT BAI : That leaves him well-positioned to take on the president. Very few candidates can get away with that, and Romney doesn't get away with it because he's so obviously the guy or because he's this great politician. He's getting away with it because he has a very weak field of rivals. MATT BAI : And to this point, he was nearly beaten and closely followed last night by two guys who can't beat him in the nominating process, I don't think. And so if you're Mitt Romney, and somebody says to you, you can keep getting beat up by the media for getting low percentages and not being able to pull in the far right of the party, but you can have the nomination and face the electorate and the broad center of the American public having not marred yourself as a candidate, I think he would take that deal in a heartbeat, and I think he'd be right to. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Matt, before we coronate Mitt Romney here, I want to talk a little bit about Jon Huntsman's strategy. John McCain, we saw twice, he boycotted or bypassed Iowa, went to New Hampshire directly and won it both times. Other candidates like Wesley Clark, Joe Lieberman have tried that and failed. What do you make of the Huntsman strategy, and does he have to do - what does he have to do here to continue? MATT BAI : Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I heard you say earlier, Jon Huntsman says he's not giving up. I don't know why he should. He hasn't run yet, right. I don't write Huntsman off. I mean, look, I don't think Romney can't be beaten in this process. I just think if you're looking at the people who've so far challenged him, right, if you're looking at the two people who came out of Iowa up there with him, I don't think those are the guys who are going to beat him. MATT BAI : He's got a bigger problem if he were right now facing - let's say if Rick Perry had gotten traction, which he just didn't. If Huntsman surges in New Hampshire, if Gingrich surges in New Hampshire, these are bigger problems, I think, for Mitt Romney. But that hasn't happened. MATT BAI : And I don't write Huntsman off. I was with him, you know, when he first came to New Hampshire on his first trip. He has, you know, obviously made his entire strategy to stay there. His numbers have gone up. I mean, if you're going to make that your whole bet, I think certainly you would want to see your polling doing better than he's done. MATT BAI : And I think Huntsman's problem has been an inability to articulate a very clear message about why he's running and what kind of alternative he offers. But the window was there and probably is still there, and if he had a good showing in New Hampshire, my sense is in South Carolina and some other states, he could get a lot of people interested very quickly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Rob, and Rob's on the line from Grand Rapids. ROB : Hey, guys. You know, I'm a Gingrich supporter, and I have been for a little bit now. But if Gingrich implodes, I really think I'm going to go towards Santorum for two reasons, one just because I believe that Gingrich's speech last night, he was almost saying in code, you know, I'm going to get negative, and there may be a chance I implode. ROB : So Santorum's a great guy. I think he gave him a little bit of a nod there. Two, I think it's because Santorum's speech last night at midnight, it was an amazing speech, and it really blew me away. He seemed extremely sincere. \n\n ###",

But Matt Bai, not everybody has a chance to meet the candidates outside of Iowa and maybe New Hampshire. Once you get to South Carolina and certainly to Florida, organization, money, advertising, that becomes the premium. MATT BAI : It does. I mean, I think this is - I'm not saying anything terribly original here, but this is the million-dollar question - or maybe, you know, the $20 million question around Rick Santorum, which is: You know, can he consolidate? No one's been able to consolidate the anti-Romney vote. MATT BAI : Is he a guy - coming out of Iowa, very unknown to a lot of people, polling very poorly in South Carolina and New Hampshire - is he a guy who can quickly, you know, consolidate that support? And I don't know. I think it's a really tall order. MATT BAI : I think the danger for Santorum, if you've watched the debates - because as you said, not everybody's going to get to meet him in his pickup truck. He can come off as very angry and very petulant. He did a lot of complaining in the debates about being ignored. I'm the - he kept saying I'm the only guy on the stage who's done this, and I'm the only guy on the stage who's done that. MATT BAI : I think, you know, there's this sincere, very likable side of Rick Santorum, which I think did come off in that speech last night, and I agree it was a good one. But then there's the kind of debating Rick Santorum, who seems a little whiny and immature. And I think that - you know, like Gingrich has now a danger zone in New Hampshire, where I think he has to control certain impulses and be a disciplined campaigner. MATT BAI : I think Rick Santorum has probably - again, I'm not a political strategist, but I think if I were talking to Rick Santorum today, I would say it's time to step back for a minute, if you can catch your breath, and think about what it is you want to project to people, because you are, as you say, getting into those mass-media states, and you have to think about how that comes across to people. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Rob, are you going to be watching these debates here in New Hampshire? ROB : I have been the whole time. I will be again, yeah. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Good luck. Thanks very much for the call. Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Matt, with Newt Gingrich finishing fourth and Rick Perry finishing fifth, is - two candidates we thought would be the strongest challengers to Romney - was Rick Santorum finishing second good news for Mitt Romney? MATT BAI : Shows you what we know, huh, Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah. MATT BAI : Oh, I really do think it's good news for Mitt Romney. I mean, look, I've learned not to prejudge. We never know what's going to - if you'd asked me three weeks ago, can Rick Santorum win Iowa, I'd have told you I might have a better chance of winning Iowa. You know, it's - and here he is, and he did - he ran a fantastic campaign there. So we really - I mean, you need a crystal ball. MATT BAI : But I think if you're Mitt Romney - and you have to game it out because that's your job - you know, I think if someone had said to you six months ago, hey, you can actually basically draw in Iowa, you'll pretty much be almost an exact tie, and the guy who's going to tie is going to be Rick Santorum, behind that is going to be Ron Paul, what are your odds of getting the nomination? I think he'd be jumping up and down and saying 99 percent. MATT BAI : I mean, for Romney, the question has never been is he going to get challenged? He's going to get challenged. There's no such thing as a Republican or Democratic front-runner who doesn't face, you know, a serious challenge. The question was going to be, by whom, and is it someone who can beat him? And I'm sure the Romney people, in fact, I know, are betting that neither Rick Santorum nor Ron Paul can realistically beat him. MATT BAI : And as you say, the people who, I think, they would have been more concerned about, you know, lacked the resources or lacked the message or haven't been able to get it going. And we haven't even talked about Rick Perry, who's apparently changed his mind and is going back to South Carolina. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's go next to Rachel, and Rachel is in Detroit. RACHEL : Hi there. When I first decided or, you know, got engaged in this election, I had an open mind to the entire field of candidates. And, you know, they were asking me, did the Iowa straw poll change your mind about who you think the - who you're going to be voting for? And I thought about that, and it did. RACHEL : For me, being avid in politics, watching the polls, Santorum has been, you know, consistently below fifth place, and here he comes up with this mysterious surge, you know, his philosophy of which really hasn't been elaborated on in the debates. So I see him as a flimsy candidate at best. RACHEL : And the fact of the matter is Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama in the last election. I'm not sure he has what it takes. And so, for me, the only consistent and clear front-runner I see is Ron Paul because he's the only one substantive enough, I think, to challenge an intellect like Barack Obama in the debates. \n\n ###",

I'm Neal Conan, in Concord, New Hampshire. But in Iowa, Romney ekes out an eyelash gold. Ron Paul settles for bronze, and a sweet silver for Santorum. It's Wednesday and time for a... RICK SANTORUM : Game on. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Edition of the Political Junkie. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN : There you go again. VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE : When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: Where's the beef? SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER : Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. SENATOR LLOYD BENTSEN : Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy. PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON : You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore. SARAH PALIN : Lipstick. GOVERNOR RICK PERRY : Oops. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH : But I'm the decider. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Every Wednesday, political junkie Ken Rudin joins us to recap the week in politics. After a long night and early morning in Des Moines, we're in the studios at New Hampshire Public Radio in Concord. Eight, count them, eight votes separate the top two in Iowa. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ron Paul remains in the top tier, Newt and Perry will soldier on, but Bachmann gets winnowed aside. We'll spend most of this hour looking ahead to next Tuesday and the primary here in New Hampshire, but first political junkie Ken Rudin joins us here in frigid Concord, and we begin as always with a trivia question. Hey Ken. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Hi, Neal, welcome to New Hampshire, and thank you, New Hampshire Public Radio. Trivia question is: Who was the last sitting president to be defeated in the New Hampshire primary? NEAL CONAN, HOST : If you think you know the answer to this week's trivia question, the last sitting president to be... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : He could have been reclining. NEAL CONAN, HOST : To be defeated in the New Hampshire primary, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. And Ken, of course the winner gets a fabulous Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt, but... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : It would be good if it was long-sleeved. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Here it would. But pop quiz, Ken: closest finish in an Iowa caucus? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : This is it. This is exactly it, eight votes. Not only is this the closest finish in Iowa history, it's also the lowest vote anybody's gotten to win the caucuses. Bob Dole got 26 percent in 1996 when he won the caucuses and then lost a week later in New Hampshire. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Mitt Romney, 25 percent, Rick Santorum 25 percent, not only the closest but the lowest percentage for a winner in Iowa. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And so Romney ekes out a win. He had been downplaying Iowa all along until, well, I guess about the last three, four weeks, when he invested heavily. He saw a chance to win, maybe a decisive win. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, I mean, the funny thing about Rick Santorum, and I guess there are two winners here. Obviously, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, Rick Santorum was the only candidate of all of them who never was the frontrunner. You know, Michele Bachmann when she won... NEAL CONAN, HOST : And isn't now. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : No, exactly, but she won the Ames Straw Poll. She was a frontrunner. When Rick Perry came in and elbowed her out of the way, he was the frontrunner. Herman Cain with his 9-9-9, he was the frontrunner, Newt Gingrich the frontrunner. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And Rick Santorum was, you know, at the end, if you looked at the debate, he was on the far left or the far right, not ideologically but just on - when you looked at the candidates, and he was out visiting all 99 counties, doing the grunt work that we always said wins, but we never thought it would matter because everything was on the debates, how Gingrich looked, how Rick Perry looked, how Mitt Romney looked. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And so tremendous comeback win, although the polls show it at the end, tremendous comeback win for Rick Santorum. But at the same time, Mitt Romney, as you say, spent a lot of time away from Iowa, focusing a lot on New Hampshire, at the last second thought he had a shot of winning it, and I guess if he had eight more votes than Rick Santorum, he did win it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, he won it, but last time he was disappointed after investing heavily in New Hampshire - excuse me, in Iowa, and coming up second to Mike Huckabee. This time, he comes in at the end, invests heavily in Iowa and ekes out a small margin of victory but just about the same percentage as he had four years ago. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Exactly, and matter of fact, fewer votes. So, I mean, for all - for four years later, as the ostensible frontrunner for the nomination, and if you ask me, I will tell you I think Mitt Romney will be the nominee, and yet you didn't see it yesterday in Iowa. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Because in part, those still surviving against him don't have the same kind of organization or the same kind of funding. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, and of course Iowa is also a different kind of bird because the electorate there, the Republican electorate there, is far more conservatives. Caucuses by definition get more conservative people out than primaries do. And so we saw, like, for example Mike Huckabee four years ago, when he won in Iowa, came to New Hampshire a week later and finished a weak third with 11 percent of the vote. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : The constituency, the Republican constituency in Iowa, is far different than it is in New Hampshire. NEAL CONAN, HOST : With one exception, one person who brought in new voters to the Iowa caucuses, younger, more moderate voters was Ron Paul. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : That's correct. I don't know about - certainly moderate on issues of the war, for example, but Ron Paul very, very strong third-place finish. There's a lot of speculation about what he will do should he not win the Republican nomination, whether he'll run for Libertarian - run as a Libertarian as he did once before. But he says no, I'm in this to win. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And his strategy is very similar to what Barack Obama did in 2008: He will go after the caucuses, which he did very cleverly against Hillary Clinton. He kind of blindsided her by focusing on caucuses. There are a lot of delegates to be picked up there, and the name of the game is delegates in 2012. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And quickly, we want to go through some of the also-rans. We have Michele Bachmann, once as we suggested the - the winner in the Ames Straw Poll last August and on the cover of Time magazine. The day she won that straw poll, Rick Perry came into the race and sort of eclipsed her. She never regained her footing, and today she bowed out. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, a weak sixth-place finish with five percent of the vote, and that was the end of Michele Bachmann. Now the question is whether she runs for a fourth term in Congress. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question, and again it is the last sitting, reclining, recumbent, however you'd like, president to lose the New Hampshire primary. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. And we'll start with Pete, and Pete's on the line from Inverness. PETE : George H.W. Bush? NEAL CONAN, HOST : George H.W. Bush. \n\n ###",

KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : A sitting president in 1992, he beat Pat Buchanan in the primary in 1992. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Despite all those peasants with pitchforks.

NEAL CONAN, HOST : The challenge from Ted Kennedy within his own party. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, actually, what's interesting to note - Jimmy Carter is the wrong answer because he beat Ted Kennedy pretty handily, but I think Ted Kennedy is the only guy from Massachusetts, when you think of John Kerry and Paul Tsongas, the only guy from Massachusetts, Henry Cabot Lodge, to lose a New Hampshire primary. Carter beat Kennedy pretty handily in 1980. NEAL CONAN, HOST : It was New York and Connecticut where he was upset. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : That's exactly right.

KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : He did, but Harry Truman was not - did not announce his candidacy, lost to Estes Kefauver in '52. A few days later, he stunned the nation and said I am not going to run for president in '52, which is exactly what Lyndon Johnson did when he beat Gene McCarthy in '68. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So in any case, that opened the door to President Adlai Stevenson. In any case, Don stay on the line, and we'll collect your particulars and send you a Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt in exchange for your promise of a digital picture of yourself wearing it that we can post on our Wall of Shame. Congratulations. I guess he's... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : He's so excited. NEAL CONAN, HOST : He's already on hold. In the meantime, some of the other campaigns in Iowa, we talked about Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry announced last night he was going back to Austin to reassess, very unusual for people to reassess and then decide to stay in. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, I mean, we saw Herman Cain suspend his campaign. Of course, we haven't heard from Herman Cain as a candidate since then. Rick Perry, when he announced yesterday he was reassessing, we all thought that was the end of the Rick Perry presidential campaign. But he did announce this morning that he will attend the two debates coming up in New Hampshire on Saturday and Sunday, and basically his focus will be the January 21st caucus - primary in South Carolina. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : That's his firewall, not his firewall so much but his last chance to salvage his bid for the nomination. NEAL CONAN, HOST : One of the best funded, other than Mitt Romney, still in the Republican field. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And what does the money mean? I mean, all the money he had he - he spent more money personally in Iowa than any other candidate, finished a weak fifth. NEAL CONAN, HOST : But one person who did not have the organization, did not have the funding but came in fourth - a month ago, Newt Gingrich said I'm going to win this thing. I am the presumed candidate. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : He was, and a lot of people probably thought so, and I think perhaps Mitt Romney thought so too, and that's why PACs aligned with - unofficially aligned with Mitt Romney, spent millions and millions of dollars hammering Gingrich for all his foibles and his problems and his baggage and which are - there's quite a few, but anyway, Gingrich got really his head handed to him, negative ads, negative ads. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And Gingrich, very interesting speech last night, he basically was not conciliatory at all. He says I'm going after Ron Paul. I'm going after Mitt Romney. You know, he's a liar, and I'm going to savage him in New Hampshire. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Look, New Hampshire all along was supposed to be Mitt Romney's firewall... NEAL CONAN, HOST : To lose. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : To lose, right, and the polls still show him with a huge lead, even Rick Santorum is way, way back in the pack, but let's see how much Mitt Romney gets beaten up in these primary debates coming up this weekend. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And we're playing the battle of expectations again. Mitt Romney was expected to win at the end of the day in Iowa. Now how much of the margin - how much is the margin? If he gets under 50 percent, is that not so good as we expected? What's going to be the expectation come New Hampshire? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Yeah, I don't know if he was the expected winner in Iowa. He certainly is the winner in New Hampshire, and we've seen in New Hampshire in the past, when Bill Clinton finished second to Paul Tsongas in 1992, and yet he was the comeback kid. When Gene McCarthy finished second, George McGovern finished second in New Hampshire in '68 and '72 respectively, and yet they were seen as the winner because they exceeded expectations. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So what is the expectation for Mitt Romney here in New Hampshire? Yes, he's going to win, but by how much? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Right, he's got to win, and he's got to win big. Right now, the polls show him anywhere between 43 and 47 percent of the vote, which is far more than he got last year, when he collapsed at the last second and lost to John McCain, who endorsed him today. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, a bit of other political news. We've, as redistricting goes on, seen any number of seats, of people in the same party forced to run against each other. One of those situations today, one of the members of Congress, sitting member of Congress, decided to retire. \n\n ###",

KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Austria's district was really basically, you know, carved up. He announced he was not going to run against Turner, his friend, in the primary and will retire. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In Utah Orrin Hatch, the long-serving Republican senator is getting a primary challenge from a young Tea Party candidate. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Exactly, I mean, of course those who were opposed to Orrin Hatch wanted Jason Chaffetz, the congressman, to run. The Tea Party is still not happy with Orrin Hatch, but he has a lot of money and still is expected to get re-nominated. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And as if things could get worse between the president and the Republicans in Congress, President Obama today announced a recess appointment.

Anyway, stay with us, we'll have more. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. We're broadcasting today from the studios of New Hampshire Public Radio. Even with a final trip to Iowa last week, political junkie Ken Rudin came out of last night's caucuses with absolutely no votes at all. He's here licking his wounds in New Hampshire. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In just under a week, the Granite State hosts the first-in-the-nation primary vote. Was there a ScuttleButton puzzle last week? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : There was. There's a new one up this week. But the last one - I had a Tiny-Tim-for-president button. Actually, it said Tiny Tim for president and first lady. There was a Tea Party button, and there was also a stop BO, the Baltimore Orioles. So when you combine those, you have Tim Tea-BO, yes. And Michael Strawminger(ph) of Fargo, North Dakota, was the winner. NEAL CONAN, HOST : All right, well, he gets a Political Junkie no-prize T-shirt. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : What luck. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And there's a new column up. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : New column, basically the history of Iowa and what it means for the candidates. NEAL CONAN, HOST : In just under a week, the Granite State here hosts the first-in-the-nation primary. Before we get to that, Mitt Romney's long been the prohibitive favorite. He was governor right next door. He owns a home here. Last night's close call re-energized the supporters of Rick Santorum. And Jon Huntsman, who skipped Iowa, is hoping for a strong performance here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Will the Iowa caucuses affect your vote? What's changed as a result of Iowa? We'd especially like to hear from voters in New Hampshire. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email is talk@npr.org. Joining us here in the studio at New Hampshire Public Radio, where he's a reporter, is Josh Rogers, and nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION. JOSH ROGERS : Nice to be here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Also with us from Dartmouth College is government professor Linda Fowler, welcome to you. LINDA FOWLER : Well, hello. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Josh Rogers, I guess we have to start with Rick Santorum, a shoe-leather campaign, retail politics, well, proved to work again in Iowa. But what kind of an organization does he have here in New Hampshire? JOSH ROGERS : Well, it's unclear what kind of organization. He does have a campaign manager, his national campaign manager Mike Biundo is from New Hampshire. He successfully steered Frank Guinta to Congress running a grassroots campaign. And prior to camping out in Iowa for some time, Santorum has done a lot of events here and in the traditional manner, not like some of the candidates, who do two events a day. JOSH ROGERS : He does six events and works it. Presumably he'll get a boost. His folks seem to think that he can, you know, galvanize the remainders. \n\n ###",

        "instruction": "Summarize the following dialogue between '###', make a brief summary on what happens in it, DON'T complete it just summarize it, the text you have to summarize is the following: \n\n ### NEAL CONAN, HOST : He's been down in single digits. JOSH ROGERS : He's been down in single digits, there's no doubt about that. I mean, no one would have imagined that he would be competitive here, and I guess we'll find out. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ron Paul is the other winner, he would say in a three-way tie, he would say, in Iowa, but he comes in with much sunnier prospects here in New Hampshire. JOSH ROGERS : Well, his message resonates naturally with a good deal of the Republican electorate. Certainly there's a libertarian streak in New Hampshire, fiscal conservativism, small government is big. The wars weren't hugely popular here, and he's had a campaign that's been working it on the ground for months, phone-banking daily. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Who's on the air? JOSH ROGERS : Not - you know, remarkably not as many ads as one might have anticipated and certainly not the onslaught we've seen in Iowa. Ron Paul's been up. Romney's got some ads up, and sort of like in Iowa, although we would anticipate there will be some ads whacking Romney, you know, he's been able to skate through without the sort of sustained barrage that, you know, his Super PAC, run by folks that are officially not with him but, you know, unofficially strong supporters have been, you know, beating down people in Iowa with. NEAL CONAN, HOST : A stealth candidate came out of nowhere to do very well in Iowa, Mr. Santorum. Would that be Jon Huntsman here in New Hampshire? JOSH ROGERS : Hard to say. I mean, Huntsman has certainly, you know, staked it all on New Hampshire. He had his 150th event last night in Peterborough, where Romney will be tonight. You could argue that the results out of Iowa, the muddle may auger to his benefit, but, you know, he's going to have to pull votes directly from Romney is at least the conventional thinking on that. JOSH ROGERS : I mean, he's reaching out to independents, but core Republicans have thus far been, you know, not too enthusiastic about him. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Linda Fowler, Josh just used an important word: independents. This is an open primary here in New Hampshire next week, which means independents can vote for a Republican if they'd like to. LINDA FOWLER : Well, that's right. What you do is go into the voting place and say for the purposes of today I want to be a Republican or a Democrat. And then once you've voted, you change your registration back to independent. So, there's also same-day registration. The interesting thing is you're registered as a Democrat, you can't go in and say I want to be a Republican today. LINDA FOWLER : So it's not a completely open primary, but it's close. And of course the verdict in New Hampshire is critical to validate Romney's claim that he's the person who can get elected in the general election because he can appeal to independent voters. LINDA FOWLER : So if he doesn't do well in the state, that's problematic for sort of the basic premise of his campaign. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, I was just going to ask, you know, Mitt Romney seems to have all the endorsements. I don't know what endorsements mean, but he got John McCain today, he has Charlie Bass, Kelly Ayotte, the senator, former governor and senator Judd Gregg. But Newt Gingrich has the Manchester - the New Hampshire Union Leader, and they've been attacking Romney, I was going to say left and right, right and right, constantly. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : What does that do to the field? What does that do to the primary electorate? JOSH ROGERS : Well, one thing that was interesting is that Speaker Gingrich - former Speaker Gingrich essentially didn't, you know, return for several weeks in the wake of that endorsement, which certainly boosted his campaign and, you know, certainly made the Romney folks a little nervous. JOSH ROGERS : They were - you know, they had got a barrage from the Union Leader last time around, and so they weren't expecting to be endorsed. But you could argue that Newt Gingrich didn't do - make the most of that. JOSH ROGERS : And with the wind, you know, putatively sort of coming out of him a little bit in Iowa, you know, perhaps it won't be as big a factor, but it's a big cudgel, and they like to wield it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Linda Fowler, you were trying to get in there. \n\n ###",

Today a lot of voters in the state get their news from the Boston stations, and so the influence of the Union Leader is not quite as substantial as it used to be, but it still matters. LINDA FOWLER : And it's a paper that takes the gloves off towards the people that it doesn't like. So Romney in the past has been able to skate sort of above the fray. Nobody's really challenged the claims that he makes that he's electable, that he can turn the country around and so forth. And the Union Leader is one of the places where that message is coming. And then we'll see whether the other candidates have ads to sort of reinforce it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : If Newt Gingrich does, as we suspect, run a scorched-earth campaign against Newt Romney, the man he's been calling... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Newt Romney? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Newt Romney, Mitt Romney, yeah, a liar these last couple of days. We'll have to see if the Union Leader takes up those cudgels, as well. But interesting, you said the Boston media, a lot of voters in the Republican Party get their cues from conservative media, including Fox News and various talk radio shows like Rush Limbaugh. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We were told that in some respects, the Iowa caucuses were going to be a measure of their influence, not pro-Romney. Mitt Romney did pretty well. How much of a factor, Linda Fowler, will conservative media play in New Hampshire? LINDA FOWLER : Well, I don't think we have good numbers on that, but what the conservative media do is play into kind of an ornery feature of New Hampshire voters. They like to take down frontrunners. They've done it a number of times. And there's also, if you remember, Pat Buchanan won here in '96, John McCain won twice, and so I think that the national news media may fuel some of that sentiment of we're going to send a message, we're not going to have a coronation here. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : You know, what fascinates me, too, is that while the Republican field still seems very muddled, maybe not in New Hampshire but nationally, yet it seems like the DNC, the White House, they were all convinced it's Mitt Romney. The Democrats have opened up a little shop in Iowa to talk - make their talking points. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And they're all - the word today is that Mitt Romney is the 25-percent man, the fact that he only can get 25 percent in Iowa, 25 percent nationally in the polls, and it just seems like while the Republicans don't know who the nominee will be, the Democrats and the White House are convinced it's Mitt Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Josh Rogers, we think Mitt Romney will do better than 25 percent here in New Hampshire. But at this point, he's got to be trying to manage expectations. JOSH ROGERS : Well, I think that's right, and, you know, a win would be a win, but, you know, talking to a lot of Republican strategists, they think if he wins by anything less than 10 points then, you know, could easily be spun as lackluster, although, you know, he will walk away with the win. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Linda Fowler, one thing we also have to understand, we were talking about the importance of the evangelical vote, social causes in the state of Iowa, it's a little different here in New Hampshire. LINDA FOWLER : Well, it is. The evangelical vote is no more than 15 to 20 percent of the primary electorate. Assuming that Rick Santorum picks up most of that, now that Bachmann isn't in the race, and Perry's not campaigning here, some will go to Ron Paul. He picked up some in Iowa. LINDA FOWLER : So my - the person I'm watching is not Santorum but is Paul. And I've said since October that I think he will do better here than people expect, and I still think that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We want to hear from those of you, especially in New Hampshire, how does Iowa change things? As we just heard from Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College, Michele Bachmann out of the race. It looks like Rick Perry is effectively skipping the race here in New Hampshire, going on to the primary in South Carolina. How does this dynamic shift, as you have Ron Paul a strong third, Rick Santorum the new man in the race against Mitt Romney? And, Ken Rudin, it's interesting that you have a meeting scheduled for this coming weekend in Texas of movement conservatives - those would be toward the right wing - people meeting to see: Can we settle on one person to run against Mitt Romney? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, it's clear from the beginning that the conservative wing in the Republican Party - which is not a small wing. I mean, basically that is the Republican Party - not happy with the prospect of Mitt Romney as the nominee, who has had, shall we say, somewhat-liberal positions in the past when he was running for office in Massachusetts. They would love for the conservative vote not to be split. They would love to unite around one candidate. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : And while Iowa voters did help narrow the field a little bit with Michele Bachmann's leaving, you still have Ron Paul. You still have Newt Gingrich. You still have Rick Santorum, and you still have Newt Gingrich. So you will still have four conservatives still splitting the vote, and that's the thing they don't want to see, because that can only help Mitt Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : They've tried to do this before. LINDA FOWLER : And... \n\n ###",

Go ahead. LINDA FOWLER : Well, of course, the story that came out of Iowa looks very different today because the vote was split. If there'd been one person, it would have been a Mike Huckabee kind of person. The storyline would have been completely different. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Let's see if we can get a caller in on the conversation. Troy is with us from Iowa City. TROY : I think the big story is that the support for - Obama supporters in Iowa have dropped significantly. But I think if Iowa caucuses were at the original date, I think Santorum would have beat Romney. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Because they were moved up earlier, because Florida moved up - it's a long, complicated story. TROY : Exactly. But I think the big story is Obama support has dropped significantly in Iowa. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Barack Obama carried Iowa handily in the 2008... TROY : But his turnout votes dropped significantly. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I understand. I was just - let me say something, Troy. Barack Obama carried the state handily back in 2008. But, Linda Fowler, how much do we read into, as Troy suggests, yes, there were a turnout for Barack Obama yesterday in Iowa, sort of a pro forma thing to boost his support... LINDA FOWLER : Yeah. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...but clearly not the energy that comes out in a caucus. LINDA FOWLER : Well, you'd - I don't take that very seriously. And one might also point that the turnout in the Republican caucuses was less than it was in 2008. But the other point that was made by one of your callers about... NEAL CONAN, HOST : Just a small correction, it was just a little bit more, but just about the same number as 2008. LINDA FOWLER : Oh, in the end, that - oh, OK. Thanks for letting me know. When I went to bed last night, it looked less. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, we - some of us got some sleep, unlike Ken. We're talking about what's changed since Iowa. Ken Rudin, the Political Junkie, is with us, also Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College, and Josh Rogers, a reporter here in New Hampshire Public Radio. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. Ken? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Can I say one more thing about the turnout? Four years ago, the Republican Party was really in a funk. They were - you had an unpopular president, President George W. Bush, an unpopular war in Iraq. You had a faltering economy. And so you had 120,000 Republicans turning out in Iowa not very excited. A similar number, maybe a little bit more, but a similar number turned out in 2012, when you would think the enthusiasm would be up, the anger against Obama would be up. And I'm surprised there wasn't a bigger Republican turnout than there was. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And what is... LINDA FOWLER : Amen to that. NEAL CONAN, HOST : ...enthusiasm like here, Josh, in New Hampshire? Do we expect to get a big turnout come Tuesday? JOSH ROGERS : I think we're expecting a reasonably large turnout. Participation is always pretty high. And if you go to the events, you know, the blood of activists is definitely up. You know, it's, you know, and the independents, they represent 40 percent of the electorate. How many of them choose to vote in the Republican primary is a tough thing to answer at this point. And so that will be a big part of the turnout. But certainly, the enthusiasm of activists, well, for me - I just came from the event where Mitt Romney was endorsed by John McCain. \n\n ###",

There were, you know, a couple of hundred people, you know, half again as many media types. But it was not enough to fill a full high-school gymnasium. They had curtained off half of it. So, you know, I don't know precisely what to make of that. But we should know - I mean, Gingrich drew a pretty big crowd into a pretty small room this morning. Santorum is arriving tonight, and it'll be interesting to see what sort of crowd he can pull. NEAL CONAN, HOST : There is also a Democratic primary next Tuesday. Will that be significant? I know there's at least one candidate running against Barack Obama. JOSH ROGERS : I forget precisely how many candidates. I mean, there are many fringe candidates running. And some people, you know, one person who's running is Randall Terry, the sort of, you know, anti-abortion activist. He's on the Democratic ticket. He's actually the first guy on the Democratic ballot this year. We'll see. The Democrats are doing kind of a dry run, let's be organized and see if we can run our get-out-the-vote operation. But I - the turnout's not going to be high. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Linda Fowler, let me turn to you. In 2006, 2008, the Republican Party was virtually obliterated - not just in this state, but across New England, this entire corner of the country. How has that shifted in the last couple of years? Is that going to continue? LINDA FOWLER : Well, in 2010, the state legislature, both chambers, were elected with veto-proof majorities of Republicans. But their agenda of expanding where people can take guns, trying to introduce bills about evolution and so forth - I think people who just voiced their disgust at the Democrats may be taking a harder look at Republicans this time around. And I'm not sure that having this highly visible, very extreme legislature is helpful to the party in the general election. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And there are a number of interesting congressional races in New Hampshire, as well, Josh Rogers. JOSH ROGERS : There are. Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat from our 1st District, is trying to reclaim her seat against Frank Guinta, who won - former mayor of Manchester, won with a lot of support from the Tea Party and from, you know, conservative voters. Should - there's a primary there, but she's expected to win. And on the Democratic side, it looks, at this point, like it'll be a rematch between Charlie Bass of the 2nd District versus Ann McLane Kuster, who ran a pretty strong campaign. JOSH ROGERS : Bass ended up nosing her out to reclaim the seat he'd previously lost to Democrat Paul Hodes, who ran for Senate last time, and he lost to newly elected Kelly Ayotte. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : What was the question again? NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken, you're the one (unintelligible)... KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : So I was actually following it, I really was. NEAL CONAN, HOST : So - but as we look ahead, Ken, how much - we saw what Iowa has done. Will New Hampshire winnow, as well? KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Well, I think if - one person to watch certainly is Jon Huntsman. He ignored Iowa. He's basing everything on New Hampshire. If he doesn't have a significant number here, he's finished. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Linda Fowler, thanks very much for your time today. LINDA FOWLER : My pleasure. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. Well, a mega-sized edition of The Political Junkie this week because of Iowa. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Today, we're in the Granite State, looking ahead to next week's first-in-the-nation primary with Political Junkie Ken Rudin at the studios of New Hampshire Public Radio. Iowa proved the campaign for the Republican nomination is nowhere near finished. Next Tuesday, voters in New Hampshire weigh in. Expectations are high for Mitt Romney, in particular. And we're going to be talking with two experts here in New Hampshire on various aspects of New Hampshire politics. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Joining us on the phone is Representative Charlie Bass, a Republican who represents the 2nd District of New Hampshire in Congress and has endorsed Mitt Romney for president. Nice to have you with us today. REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : Good to be with you, Neal. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION. And also with us here in the studios at NHPR is State Senator Andy Sanborn, co-chair of Ron Paul's campaign in New Hampshire. Nice of you to be with us. \n\n ###",

I appreciate it. And Congressman Bass, who's my congressman, good afternoon. REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : Good afternoon, Senator Sanborn. How are you? STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : Fine. Thank you. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, let's start with Congressman Bass, because you're endorsing the person, well, widely regarded as the frontrunner here in New Hampshire. What does an eyelash victory in Iowa do for Mitt Romney? REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : I think that Governor Romney had set his sights at second or possibly even third place. I think it was perceived around here, at least, that Iowa was not necessarily going to be his strongest state. Until recently, as we - as you heard - we've all heard, Governor Romney hadn't put much of an effort into Iowa, but did near the end. And I think his showing is really quite extraordinary, given the level of effort. Now, it shifts to New Hampshire. And I've been in the business of being involved in this process since 1979, when I endorsed Howard Baker for president. And things can change very quickly. So my advice to Governor Romney has been : run like you're three votes behind, and don't expect anything to be the same next Tuesday as it is today. I think Rick Santorum's good showing in Iowa and the fact that he has worked hard in this state now for almost two years now - as has Jon Huntsman - means that, you know, Mitt Romney, who's also worked hard here, will have to match him, you know, step for step during the next five days, because a lot of people will make up their minds between now and next Tuesday. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And Senator Sanborn, the person - Ron Paul came in, well, maybe a slight disappointment there in Iowa, but expected to do very well here in New Hampshire, as well. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : Yeah, Neal. I mean, clearly, the fact that the Iowa results said, you know, one very obvious point, and that's, you know, there's three - we're essentially down to three different candidates in this race. As you note, Ron Paul has been truly the consistent, stable voice, something people can truly believe that, you know, he's - when he says what he says, he means what he says, he has a phenomenal group of people working here in the state of New Hampshire. He's been here for some time, as you know. He has, you know, very dedicated, loyal support. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : You know, one of the things I find that's so exciting about Dr. Paul is, obviously, when we talk - start talking about how some candidates have come up and come down, and there's been this real gyration within the Republican Party, that Dr. Paul's numbers have continued just to migrate north, that he hasn't had to back up at any level whatsoever. And, you know, people are really ready to pick a president or a presidential candidate that actually, you know, says they're going to cut the size of government, going to push back on the scope and the regulation. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : And this is the type of state for that. As Congressman Bass knows, we're a people that really believe in personal freedoms, who really embrace personal responsibility. And that's what Congressman Paul brings to this, and so we're very, very excited for Tuesday. We're working really hard, and we expect to see some great things coming out of it. NEAL CONAN, HOST : As he left Iowa last night, Congressman Paul talked to his supporters as results came in. And this was a little bit of his message. REPRESENTATIVE RON PAUL : We will go on. We will raise the money. I have no doubt about the volunteers. They're going to be there. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Senator Sanborn, yes, volunteers were a huge part of the effort for Ron Paul in Iowa. What does the organization look like here in New Hampshire? STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : I actually think it's bigger and stronger in New Hampshire than it even was in Iowa. You know, we're very happy that our brothers and sisters out there did such a great job of bringing out the message and bringing people into the caucus and bringing a great result - again, you know, solidifying the fact that we're truly down to three great candidates. In New Hampshire, I believe that our organization's bigger. I believe that our ground force is stronger, our message is - our messaging is fantastic. And we're really showing it with real numbers, as you know. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Well, let's not forget Rick Santorum, who had that late surge in Iowa and came in eight votes behind. Boy, a great showing for him, but a little bit frustrating too. But anyway, as he talked to his supporters early this morning in Des Moines, former Senator Santorum said he's moving on, as well. RICK SANTORUM : Because the message I shared with you tonight is not an Iowa message, or an Iowa and South Carolina message. It is a message that will resonate across this land. It's a resonate - it will resonate, I know, in New Hampshire. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Congressman Bass, difficult to ask you to handicap the opposition, but Rick Santorum, what kind of a challenge does he present to the front-runner, your man Mitt Romney? REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : Well, as I said a minute ago, Rick Santorum is articulate. He's attractive. He's young. He's energetic. He's hardworking. He's been here in New Hampshire for almost two years. I knew him when he was in the state Senate. He was elected to the state Senate the same year I was elected to Congress. We've worked well together. But I think that the scope of - the portfolio, if you will, that Rick Santorum brings to the table is attractive to a relatively narrow group of voters that have been looking for somebody other than Mitt Romney now for about a year. And the question is: Does that group of voters translate into a majority in November? And I think that Rick Santorum, who has significant experience in Washington - he obviously, you know, understands politics. REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : But my candidate, Mitt Romney, has been in the business community now for 25 years. As we all know, he turned the Olympics around, and he's a remarkably diverse individual in terms of his background experience. And, obviously, he has the shoulders, as he puts it, to bear what is going to be a very, very nasty campaign for president. If he has to run against an incumbent that has a billion dollars in the bank, I think Republicans can legitimately say to themselves: Who do we want to have represent us after the convention? And who is most likely to win this election in November? Because after all, that's what these primaries are ultimately all about. NEAL CONAN, HOST : I think, Congressman Bass, you misspoke slightly when you said Rick Santorum elected to the state Senate. You meant the United States Senate. He went to Washington the same year you did. \n\n ###",

NEAL CONAN, HOST : Oh, I see. Well, who wouldn't? STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : Thank you, Congressman. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Ken Rudin. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Quickly, Congressman Bass, first of all, condolences of the passing of your father. We talked about him the last time you were on the show. He was quite a guy, and I'm sorry about your loss. REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : Thank you. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : What we saw with Mitt Romney is obviously his - he needs to reconnect with conservatives. And he's still stuck at 25 percent nationally in the polls, 25 percent in Iowa. Does the John McCain endorsement - while McCain is very popular here in New Hampshire, what does McCain say to the conservatives out there who want to get some kind of a message, a signal from Mitt Romney? REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : Well, I think McCain is a little different now than he was a decade ago. He's been through a really tough campaign. He took on J.D. Hayworth in the primary last - or, a year and a half ago now. And, obviously, you know, he is a winner, because he won the nomination. He was the - you know, the delegates of the convention nominated him, despite the fact that he has somewhat different credentials from a person like Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich, possibly. REPRESENTATIVE CHARLIE BASS : I think John McCain is the kind of person that will play in New Hampshire, and where he's needed in other states. Most know, you know, I'm not a political junkie myself, but in states where he did well and where he has a good base, I think he'll be a huge asset. And you combine him with Governor Christie of New Jersey - who's immensely popular, not only here, but probably all across the nation, along with others - I think Governor Romney has a nice sort of portfolio of individuals with different backgrounds, different philosophies, all of them supporting him because they believe that he has the temperament, you know, somewhat akin to, you know, how do you review somebody that you're thinking about proving for the U.S. Supreme Court? It's not about every specific issue. It's about how successful you are in resolving problems. One other item : Mitt Romney knows how to work with the Democrats. Good Lord. The minorities that he had - or majorities, Democrat majorities that he had to work with in Massachusetts certainly showed that he can - that he might be able to end the gridlock, if you will, or he certainly knows how to get things done in an environment where you have mixed-party representation. So we'll just see how John McCain works. I mean, he'll be helpful to Mitt in some places, and I'm sure the governor will use him to the greatest extent possible. NEAL CONAN, HOST : Andy Sanborn? STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : Congressman, thanks. You know, part of the support of John McCain in - you know, he has a great, established history. He's done wonderful things in defending our country and being a senator. But, again, it clearly shows that the Romney campaign - and one of the things I truly love about Congressman Bass and most of us here in New Hampshire is we always prefer to talk about what's great about our candidate versus getting in the weeds and making it dirty. And I truly appreciate that. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : And for Congressman Paul, compared to Governor Romney, you know, all these endorsements that the governor picks up continue to be very similar to where he is. And I personally think it's a challenge for him to have McCain come in, just like with Christie. And I appreciate them both. But it perpetrates the conversation that he can only seem to find moderate Republicans who have been, you know, not quite as strict on cutting, not quite as strict on pushing back on regulation or taxation. So he hasn't had that ability to truly cross all the borders between conservative, moderate and maybe liberal Republicans. KEN RUDIN, BYLINE : Although he did get Nikki Haley in South Carolina. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : He did - absolutely. I stand corrected on that. It's - again, we go back to Congressman Paul, where his support, I mean, truly exceeds all levels of the political spectrum. And he's so strong with independents. He's actually good with some Democrats. So I actually see his support being broader, although still keeping that, you know, no holds barred, I make no exception, I'm a conservative. And that's what he says every day. NEAL CONAN, HOST : We're talking with Senator - State Senator Andy Sanborn, co-chair of Ron Paul's New Hampshire presidential campaign, and with Congressman Charlie Bass, who's endorsed Mitt Romney. Of course, Political Junkie Ken Rudin is with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. NEAL CONAN, HOST : And, Senator Sanborn, you talked about an upbeat campaign. In the air war in Iowa, both Ron Paul's campaign and the Mitt Romney campaign, through its super PAC, you could say there's plausibility - plausible deniability there. You could say there's not. That's an argument. But any case, both leveled very harsh advertising at Newt Gingrich, who came in fourth and complained bitterly about the negative ads that were run against him. Do those guns get turned around and aimed at Mitt Romney now in Massachusetts? STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : You know, that's a great question, whether or not they get aimed at Mitt Romney, whether or not they get aimed at Rick Santorum. And like Congressman Bass, I know Rick Santorum, great guy, truly understands what he believes in. And he had a great showing out in Iowa. You know, when it comes to the negative ad thing, in New Hampshire, I don't believe it plays as well as, maybe, other states. We have a much lower tolerance to negative ads, and... NEAL CONAN, HOST : That's what they said in Iowa, too. It seemed to work, though. STATE SENATOR ANDY SANBORN : It did seem to work against Newt. And, you know, it shows that they work. As much as you don't want to hear them, it does show that there's some plausibility to that. But, you know, for us on the Paul campaign, there's a positive message about those traditional New Hampshire Yankee values and American values of cutting, of pushing back and finding someone who really is consistent and believable. \n\n ###",
