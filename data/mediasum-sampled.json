This edition is billed as \"The Complete Bible.\" It doesn't have one person reading the gospels. It features nearly 400 African-American artists, actors and ministers, plus sound effects. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Just listen to Blair Underwood's rendition of Jesus on the cross. Mr. BLAIR UNDERWOOD (Actor) : (As Jesus) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, we've got two people affiliated with the project with us today. Kyle Bowser, he co-produced \"The Bible Experience\" and actress Wendy Raquel Robinson, one of the actors in \"The Bible Experience,\" and she also stars in the CW series, \"The Game.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Hi folks, how are you doing? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Great. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Great. How are you? FARAI CHIDEYA, host : I'm doing great. Now, Kyle, how did this project come about? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Hmm. A couple of winters ago, while Christmas shopping, I purchased an audio bible and hoped that I would finally get through the Bible by listening to it in my car. And I had failed to read the Bible as I'd promised. And after listening to a couple of disks, I was very disappointed. It just didn't really resonate with me. There was a lack of real production value. And the idea struck that perhaps we should try to do this ourselves and bring the Hollywood experience that we have to the process. And I think we have accomplished that goal. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Were you ever afraid of crossing a line and saying, okay, we're going to make this too Hollywood - the Bible is going too Hollywood? And I'm thinking of all the criticism of Mel Gibson's movie, \"The Passion of the Christ.\" \n\n ###",

I think the gospel is applicable wherever you go including Hollywood. If anything, I was a little concerned about the idea of profiting from the Bible. But after consulting with some theologians and my grandmother, I got over that quickly. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Now, Wendy - now, you were the voice of an angel in the book of Revelations. Let's take a listen to that. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Unidentified Man: A second angel followed and said, Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : (As Angel) Fallen. Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : That (unintelligible). FARAI CHIDEYA, host : What did you - yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So - I mean, it's not bad to be an angel. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : No. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Other than that, what made you want to do this? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : You know, it's amazing. I feel like I got kind of bombarded the project. I knew Robi Reed who was also the casting director, and (unintelligible) who was actually working on it. And one day, I happened to be there and I saw a demo of what they were doing. And I said, hands down. How can I be a part of this? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : So I just pretty much put myself into it because I was just so drawn by the emotion, by - I mean, of course, you know, any time you're doing something that's related to the Gospel and to the Bible, you know - immediately I was drawn to that. But it was just so different from any project that I've ever been attached to or had even, you know, been around. So I was just - I basically - I bombarded the project myself. \n\n ###",

Obviously, people are getting very much into the iPod\u2026 Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Mm-hmm. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \u2026and podcasting, listening to this-that and the other in your car. Do you think that this opens up other people to the - I mean, we just did a series on religion not too long ago. Certainly, not every one is Christian. Not every black person is Christian, but there is\u2026 Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Right. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : \u2026plenty. Do you think this opens up new experiences for people who are plugging in or plugged into Christianity? Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : Oh, I think it definitely does because not only is it the actual goal in its presentation, but it is the, you know, it's the true word of God, too. So you're getting both in one, you know? It's really difficult for me to listen to books on tape or, you know, just basically even - I don't care if these just sermons or anything like that. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : But with this, you know, you'd get the fullness of it, you know? You get the sound effects; you get the emotions; you get the authentic word of God, you know? And it's really easy listening to, and before you know it, you'd do the entire New Testament, you know - before you know it, so it's awesome. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Kyle, now, the first Bible experience was the New Testament. It won 2007 audio book of the year - that's high praise. What kind of fan mail have you gotten that really warms your heart? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Well, I'm glad you ask that question because so often, people ask about the success of the project and it counts the question in a monetary context. I think the only way to really measure the success of \"The Bible Experience\" is to look at the fan mail, to look at the e-mails and the cards and the letters and the personal testimony that we hear. Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : I have a cousin who, three months ago, was struck by a car while riding his bike. And he's been laying paralyzed for the last three months. And on his second day in the hospital, he whispered in his wife's ear, asking for her to bring a copy of \"The Bible Experience\" to his room. That's the kind of evidence of the success of \"The Bible Experience.\" It speaks to your soul. \n\n ###",

But for others, it's enjoyable because it is so dramatic. It is so emotionally powerful. You know, it's historically accurate whether or not you apply the faith analysis to the word. So much of what's written in the Bible has been proven to be historically accurate and we capture all of that so wonderfully. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Wendy, what's it like for you to be a part of this ensemble? It's one of the largest ensemble cast of black actors, I guess you could say. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : It's bigger than \"Roots.\" FARAI CHIDEYA, host : It is. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : No. Oh, it is. I feel like it's a part of history. I'm sorry; I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : No, that's - it's true. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : But I'm honored, you know? I mean, Blair Underwood, Forest Whitaker, you know, Angela Bassett. So, so many of the celebrities that I admire and look up to were a part of this. But that's not why I was drawn to it, but it just takes it to a whole another level for me on so many different levels. Ms. WENDY RAQUEL ROBINSON (Actress) : And to see these other artists, you know, praising God through their work, you know. It's an anointed piece, you know, because you can't half-step with God. You know what I mean? You have to really drink it, so when they did the interpretations in the studio and if you even get a chance to see the video portion of it, it's amazing. I mean, it just brings you to tears emotionally. And just, you know, really reliving those moments, you can actually see these characters within the Bible come to life. FARAI CHIDEYA, host : Kyle, very quickly - I mean, super quick. Any future plans? It's - you kind of gone to both testaments, what have you got left? Mr. KYLE BOWSER (Co-producer, \"The Bible Experience: The Complete Bible\") : Well, we - meaning me and my partners - are all thinking about different ways that we can continue to share this wonderful experience in whatever medium is available - visually, through audio product, through all of the distribution technologies that are available. So please, stay tuned for that. \n\n ###",

OK, so now imagine it's your first election. We talked to a few young voters making their choices for the very first time in a general election. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : So my name's Ashanti Martinez (ph). I'm 20 years old. I'm from Prince George's County, Md., and I'm voting for Hillary Clinton. LAUREN SMITH : Hi, I'm Lauren Smith. I'm 20 years old and I'm voting for Trump. GENESIS LARIN : My name is Genesis Larin. I'm from Houston, Texas. And I'd say I'm a conflicted voter but leaning towards Hillary Clinton. NICK TOMCHIK : My name is Nicholas Tomchik (ph). I'm from Winslow, Maine. I'm 20 years old, and I'm voting for Gary Johnson. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : All right, so I want to learn more about how each of you came to your decision. So I'm going to start with you, Lauren. You're voting for Donald Trump. Did you support him in the Republican primary? LAUREN SMITH : No, I actually supported Ted Cruz. And, you know, I have to say, there's no question that this election cycle has been unbelievable. So I'm voting for Trump because not only am I a Republican but he has a pro-life agenda. He's for a limited government, and that's what I support. Am I happy with him? No, absolutely not. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Nick, you've decided to support the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson. How come? Why not Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Why go with a third-party option? NICK TOMCHIK : All my life, I've gone against the status quo. I'm a Libertarian myself. I definitely believe in what Gary Johnson has to offer, his policies - minimizing the role of government, pro-choice. You know, we've got to cut the wasteful spending. We've got to offer an alternative. And especially with this election being so, you know, as Lauren said, you know, pretty much crazy, we've got to have another choice. And he brings that to America. And I really like that. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Genesis, you said you're leaning reluctantly towards Hillary Clinton. But I understand that's a big deal because you're a registered Republican. \n\n ###",

But yes, I am, I guess, leaning towards Hillary Clinton just because I'm very disappointed in the candidates that I have to choose from. But I just can't support what Donald Trump has said, even though I did vote Republican for the primaries. However, I did vote for Marco Rubio. I feel like this election, at least for me, has come down to voting against someone instead of a vote for someone that actually aligns with a lot of, like, my views for certain issues. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : And you haven't found that in either of the major party candidates? GENESIS LARIN : It was mentioned before that Hillary Clinton, her experience as far as policies - and I do take into account her experience. And I guess I feel comfortable because she has been around. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : What do you not like about her? What gives you pause about her? GENESIS LARIN : Part of it is her scandals. But it's also she has, you know, kind of switched sides on some of the policies. So if anything, I was kind of confused on, like, exactly where she stands because it just comes off as she's saying certain sides just to get a vote. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Ashanti, what do you think when you hear that? I mean, you're an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter, but she's had kind of a tough time making inroads with people your age. What are the top issues for you? ASHANTI MARTINEZ : One of them would be definitely college affordability, making sure that no matter where you are on the income spectrum in this country that you can go to college debt-free or that you can leave college debt-free. The next issue for me is health care, making sure that folks are able to have quality health care in this country. And then I guess the next issue for me that really comes home is criminal justice reform. Too many people of black and brown skin color, that look like me, go to jail, oftentimes, for sentences and things that they shouldn't have. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : I want to ask you, Lauren - you heard Genesis say that she identifies as a Republican. She voted for Marco Rubio in the primary, but she's considering voting for Hillary Clinton. What do you say to her? LAUREN SMITH : I think as a Republican, I don't understand how you could support Hillary Clinton. And I understand many of what Trump has said is, quite frankly, deplorable. And I completely get that. However, if you're a Republican, if you believe in limited government, if you're pro-life, vote for Donald Trump. And again, that's the issues that I fully support and that I want to see happen in America. I want Roe v. Wade to be overturned. So Genesis, what I would say to you is, what issues are holding you back? And why can't you vote for Donald Trump, if I can ask you that... RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Sure. \n\n ###",

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Genesis, you want to answer? GENESIS LARIN : Yeah. So I'm actually pro-choice. I do... LAUREN SMITH : OK. GENESIS LARIN : ...Believe that climate change is something that we need to address. That being said, I've never particularly, I guess, been completely on board with bigger government.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : You're that coveted middle-of-the-road voter. GENESIS LARIN : (Laughter) Yeah. And I feel - the way I approached the selection wasn't blue or red or green, even. It was I wanted to find a candidate that I think was most representative of my view and whose competency in doing this, at being president, I would feel comfortable voting for. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Nick, let me ask you this - are you feeling enthusiastic about your choice? Like, are you - how do you feel about supporting Gary Johnson? NICK TOMCHIK : Yeah. I honestly am very enthusiastic about supporting him. That's the thing that I think makes me different and also maybe the Libertarians or the independents that are, you know, supporting Gary Johnson.

NICK TOMCHIK : Not at all. I definitely think that that plays into the fear-mongering because from a lot of people I hear, they want to vote for Gary but they're - you know, they tell me that argument. And essentially, if all the people who, you know, actually voted third party - said that they're not going to vote for the third party because of that voted third party, then, you know, Gary Johnson has a huge chance of winning. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Lauren, your candidate, Donald Trump, has had a hard time getting the kind of support from women voters that he needs to put him in good standing when November 8 rolls around. Why do you think that is, especially when you talk to your peers, other young women? I mean, how much of it - of the reluctance has to do with the kind of rhetoric we've heard from him, those recent comments on the \"Access Hollywood\" tape? Is that coming up in conversations? LAUREN SMITH : You know, a lot of my peers, especially the women, do support Donald Trump. I don't condone sexual assault. I mean, that's utterly ridiculous. But we have to remember that was a long time ago. I mean, 2005 happened almost 11 years ago. So as far as Donald Trump's comment on women go - does it bother me? It does in some ways, but I'm choosing to look at the bigger picture. And I'm choosing to look at America as a whole instead of trying to, you know, just go and tear Trump to shreds over what he said in the past. So the women that I have spoken to, especially the the Women for Trump here in Virginia, of course they support him. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : If I can chime in, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : Go for it, Ashanti. ASHANTI MARTINEZ : For me - right? - I've talked to a lot of women. I'm around women often. And these Trump allegations about him sexually assaulting women and bragging about it is deplorable. And it's something that is definitely on people's minds, especially around my age group. But this isn't the first instance, right? We look at the comments that he had with former Miss America and former Miss Universe contestants. We look at the comments that he had about contributors on different networks. We look at the comments that he's had of people on his own show, on \"The Apprentice,\" and how he's treated women throughout his career, whether it be in real estate or whether it be on television. So to me, to say that these things don't matter is wrong. This man has so many different things that don't speak to our country as being inclusive and as progressive as we should be. And I think that's why he's not qualified. LAUREN SMITH : Well, I certainly understand that position. But I also have to say I don't want Hillary Clinton as president. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST : This is your first time voting in a presidential election. So how you feeling? I mean, what are the conversations that you're having at home or with your friends? Are people animated to get out and vote? Is there a sense of apathy? I'm going to start with Lauren. What are people talking about in your circles? LAUREN SMITH : There's one side, the 50 percent - they're very apathetic. They don't want to get out and vote. You know, I've lost friends because of the way I'm voting. And, in some ways, I understand that. \n\n ###",
